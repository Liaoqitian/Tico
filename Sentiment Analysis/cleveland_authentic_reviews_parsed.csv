__rNL7RODe1D85sWuU-FKg,"I have to say I was a bit disappointed....pricey and mediocre. The chicken noodle soup  had the requisite chicken, carrots, and celery, but had an overbearing taste of turnips or parsnips. Would have preferred an authentic basic Jewish broth. The $11  club sandwich had a fried egg inserted next to the bread. Didn't make much sense and seemed to interfere the classic taste of a club. The accompanying fries were great. 

Looking around the room, I saw the chicken a la king where the waffels dominated the plate,  with a meager count of little dark meat morsels. The $11 hamburger looked like Mawby's with grilled onions, but could be consumed in three bites.  The staff was freindly and attentive, but I think it really makes sense to go there for breakfast. But it probably wouldn't be as good as Corky's or Jack's.",0
__rNL7RODe1D85sWuU-FKg,"I recently visited while in town and had a fantastic experience. My two young sons and I ate at the counter, which was really fun and made the experience even more authentic to this well designed and light filled diner.  I had a veggie omelet and the boys had hot dogs and burgers. You could tell that everything was fresh and made on site and had similar quality to Chef Katz's other restaurant, Fire. My son declared it to be the second best burger of his entire life. The fries were delicious and we were especially intrigued with the wide variety of impressive desserts. We tried the homemade Oreo and a chocolate chip cookie and left craving more.  I will definitely visit again on another trip for any meal or even late night grub since they are open so late. I only wish that I lived closer to stop on my way to work for a latte and scone.  It's definitely worth getting into your regular rotation. Yum!",1
__rNL7RODe1D85sWuU-FKg,"This place is awful. Don't be confused by the fact that the building looks pretty cool, and the 7 layer chocolate cake is pretty damn good. Because the service is TERRIBLE.

I went in with a friend for an after-dinner coffee and dessert. A simple enough order, right? WRONG. We were ignored even though the diner was completely empty except the four Walking Dead extras dressed in their finest 50s attire that were sloughing around pretending to be waiters. 

After what seemed like an eternity, one zombie caught a glimpse of what must have been a shadow of a memory from their human life and listlessly shuffled forward, to take our order.

While zombie #1 was making the coffees, zombie #2 reanimated, producing a haunting utterance which we took as the closest thing to an inquiry of any further desires. We asked to be served a slice of chocolate cake. She stared at us dumbfounded, the life in her eyes gone now. ""Oh...He cuts the cakes,"" she grunted.

You can't cut cakes? We're not drilling to the center of the earth. We're just asking that you slide a piece of thin metal through a piece of soft pastry. But fine. Maybe there's a process that the rest of the human race is simply not privy to about the intricacies of cake separation and distribution.

When we were finally served, zombie #1 walks right by a heaping rack of pristine white coffee mugs and elects instead to pour our drinks into paper to-go cups. Paper cups? What the literal fuck?! This isn't freaking rush hour. Its 9:00 PM; we are obviously here to enjoy a little coffee talk over a slice of cake in your otherwise lovely establishment like normal non-dead humans do. 

Finally, the master of cake slicing has freed up a moment of his precious time to slice on our behalf. He walks past a stack of perfectly good desert plates, grabs a to-go box for the cake, and OH HELL NAH! We ain't going nowhere! Put our cake on a plate, mother trucker! 

I get it. This is a 50s establishment, and you're just trying to create an authentic experience. And us being a Latina and an African American...we should have known better. Our kind ain't welcome in these parts. Maybe we should have used the back door.",0
__rNL7RODe1D85sWuU-FKg,"Do I love diners? Why yes, I LOVE diners. Do I love the Katz Club Diner? YES YES YES!

I've always been a sucker for diners. My favorite memories in college is sitting in a local diner, getting my eggs, toast, and sausage with weak coffee for a price tag of $5. Sure, the inside of diners were always dingy and ugly, but hey, it's comforting. Take a step up- Coney Islands. Oh, how I miss the Coney Islands of Michigan. Sigh. Nevertheless, when I stepped into the Katz Club Diner, I felt a sigh of relief. Yes, here was my diner...but a fancier one than what I have had in the past.

The Katz Club Diner is pretty cool- from the guy who owns Fire, it's a half diner restaurant car, and a half speakeasy car. You want good food? Go to the left. You want a speakeasy lounge? Go to the side door on the side of the car.

Went here on two occasions:
For dinner:
- He got the chicken and waffles- oh man, that was a great tasting waffle and great chicken. It's not your typical fried chicken with waffle- it's more of a light fluffy waffle with almost a stir fry dark meat chicken on top..with some type of gravy. Nonetheless, that was the win of the night.
- I got the monte cristo sandwich. It was good...and BIG. The sizes they give you....are quite hefty. Nonetheless, it was good.

For breakfast:
- WIN: They serve Rising Star coffee! I've taken a step up from the weak watery coffee that I'm used to in the diners I used to frequent.
- He got an omelette. It was good and solid.
- I got the corned beef hash. Whew- that was one heavy corn hash. It was good though! Picture thick cuts of corned beef... Mmmmmm. Good stuff. With a side of toast. Mmmm.

You'll be definitely full here. But the wait staff is great and knowledgeable, and they serve great food with even a pastry window near the entrance as well. But you know what I love most about it? The FEEL of a diner. What makes it authentic? When old couples come in to eat breakfast together. When old men sit by themselves, eating their breakfast and reading their newspaper. Where the locals frequent. That's a diner for ya. Sure, it's a fancy diner, but hey, it's a diner, and I like it. Check it out when you get a chance.",1
_5inlOVvlrCOKcI772RqJQ,This Benihana location is not what it used to be the food does not taste the way it used to taste the sushi taste very bland all the chefs are not Asian Japanese or Chinese so if you're going for an authentic feel you won't find it here it is a lot more pricier than the competitors but unfortunately Benihana is a thing of the past at least in Beachwood I would highly recommend going to Wasabi's on Rockside Road or Fiji Japan in Macedonia if I woulda wrote this review 2 years ago it would have been 5 stars but this place is really gone bad I know them when they used to be the samurai and the samurai was 100 times better than benihanas but Benihana was good I guess for the last 15 years but now it's just terrible the food didn't even taste like Japanese food to me. And to top it all off it was my wife's birthday and I told the manager and our chef and our server and when the time came to leave they didn't even want to sing happy birthday for us or bring a dessert and told us we're very short staffed right now but meanwhile the tables next to us had people that work at the restaurant singing happy birthday and taking pictures of them very unpleasant service we received that is very expensive for nothing.,0
_8Os_hsIMqO7njlJChHdvA,"If you want authentic, homemade Croatian food this is THE place.  Owned by a family from Hercegovina, the food is made by mom and the daughters and simply can not be beat!  Tonight I had their homemade meatloaf, made with the same mix of meats they use in their Sarma (aka cabbage rolls), served with tasty Croatian home fries and fresh bread.  You can wash it down with a Croatian beer, Karovacko Pivo.  Their Sarma is genuine made with soured cabbage leaves, plenty of flavor from the paprika.... and NO tomatoes.  The best you will find.",1
_8Os_hsIMqO7njlJChHdvA,"I finally found a restaurant in Cleveland that serves authentic Croatian cuisine! The stuffed cabbage, cevapi, and city chicken take me back to some of my favorite restaurants in Croatia! Really generous portions at affordable prices and excellent customer service! Definitely give it a try!",1
_doekI31rRF3iLOZhbzVeg,"Wow what a awesome experience I ordered the carne Assada dinner everything was great steak tacos looked awesome there's a mini authentic taco bar too and the fried ice cream is just great I'm defidently gonna be a regular !!! 


Update carne Asada was dissatisfying and lacked the greatness it once was maybe a new chef. They need to serve chips and salsa and maybe upgrade menu",0

_doekI31rRF3iLOZhbzVeg,Best spot for authentic street tacos.  The staff here is supper friendly and the service is always fast. And try the Horchata. This is probably one of very few Mexican restaurants who actually have it.,1
_doekI31rRF3iLOZhbzVeg,Hands down the BEST Al Pastor I've had in Cleveland. So much I want to try! Everything tastes fresh and authentic. This is not your Taco Bell tacos. Margaritas are strong and on point. I'll be back for sure!,1
_doekI31rRF3iLOZhbzVeg,"AMAZING!! Great service & authentic tacos! I got a shrimp taco, fish taco, & shrimp quesadilla and they were all mouth watering! Went with 7 people total, we all got different things and everyone loved it! Will definitely be back!",1
_doekI31rRF3iLOZhbzVeg,"Great food with attentive and friendly staff. 

We've been here three times and had the chorizo/pastor  tacos, chorizo/carnitas sopes, ceviche tostadas, pastor burrito and camaron quesadilla de maiz. All really good and authentic, but the corn tortilla on the quesadilla de maiz was exceptional. The burrito was comically large and delicious.

The salsa bar is fully loaded with varying  degrees of verde and roja sauce along with pickled and fresh veggies 

The frosty margs and palomas are good and strong. Get the grande!",1
_doekI31rRF3iLOZhbzVeg,"Amazing street tacos at super low prices. I'm not a fan of soft corn tortillas in general, but theirs are delicious. My favorite are the chorizo. The salad bar has delicious toppings and salsa/sauces. Great place for authentic Mexican food.",1
_doekI31rRF3iLOZhbzVeg,"Just opened on Lorain Avenue in Cleveland's Westown neighborhood and features authentic street tacos and other menu items.

I had the chorizo and chicken tacos with a side of rice and beans.  The protein came out very conservatively seasoned, but that was a good thing because they have a toppings bar with a nice selection of salsas, cilantro, onions and other items which allows you to have your tacos just how you like them! 

Washed it down with a strawberry Jarritos and left happy!

BUENO!!",1
_doekI31rRF3iLOZhbzVeg,"Warm and friendly atmosphere with passionate ownership.  Street tacos are authentic and delicious, salsa bar is fantastic. Amazing tequila selection, and margaritas that are refreshing and buzz worthy.",1
_doekI31rRF3iLOZhbzVeg,"Fantastic Chorizo!  Great authentic Mexican food and top notch service, had a great time and will be back any time we are in the area!",1
_doekI31rRF3iLOZhbzVeg,"Most authentic tasting Mexican food I've had in Cleveland. I've spent a good chunk of my life living in south Texas and even on the Mexican border. The al pastor and lengua tasted like what I would get in south Texas. They have a nice salsa bar to top your tacos or dishes and the portion sizes are large. 

They give you chips and salsa for the table and the salsa tastes fresh and is good. It isn't too spicy for those that don't like spicy food. 

Clean restrooms and a staff that's actually from Mexico and knows what authentic food should taste like. 

This is my go to spot for Mexican food.",1
_doekI31rRF3iLOZhbzVeg,"By far the most authentic Mexican food in all of the Greater Cleveland area. I can say that with confidence as well since I have had my fair share of Mexican food around the area. The owner and staff are great as well. If you want to feel like you are eating in Mexico, eat here. The staff has greatly improved since my initial visit.",1
_doekI31rRF3iLOZhbzVeg,"Amazing authentic tacos for a great price. I got the fish, carnitas, and chorizo. Casual, fun, atmosphere with lots of people just hanging out and having a good time! We will definitely be back!",1
_doekI31rRF3iLOZhbzVeg,Saw the sign for authentic street tacos so I stopped to check it out.  Nice place but hard to find parking.   I Ordered 3 of the chorizo street tacos service was fast and staff was more than pleasant.  Got tacos very quick they have a little toppings bar and I added some onion and cilantro along with some verde salsa.  Tacos were excellent will stop by again !!,1
_doekI31rRF3iLOZhbzVeg,"New favorite taco spot in the city. 

I just moved into this neighborhood, Jefferson/West Park, a couple weeks ago and drove by this place every day on my way to and from work. I can't believe it took me this long to try it, because OH MY GOODNESS, what quality.

The tacos are authentic, with so many meat choices. I ordered the pollo tacos, as well as the al pastor. I'm completely content with having these tacos for the rest of my days. That's how tasty they were! So full of flavor, juicy, and the corn tortillas were perfect.

You can garnish them how you like at the garnish/condiments bar in the middle of the restaurant. So many things to choose from: cilantro, onion, pickled onions, tomatoes, lettuce, jalapenos, all of the salsas, and even sour cream. 

My fiance got a burrito and it was the size of his face. The prices are super reasonable. We ordered a burrito, re-fried beans, 3 tacos and unlimited amounts of toppings for less than $20.

If you're on the west side and want to try a different authentic taco spot (we all know where everyone usually goes - cough cough La Plaza) get here pronto. You won't be disappointed.",1
_g0dF6TAj7-RlSUfsGwl7w,"I was craving some chinese-flavored food (I'm not a stickler for authenticity in this department, just settling for good-tasting food) one day and decided to give this place a try. I've only heard good things about it so I was pretty excited. The service was really fast and the staff was very nice, taking the time to explain to me how to order and what to expect. However, there was a special on the sign outside that they put out daily and when I asked about it the guy had no clue what I was referring to. Odd, if you put the sign out promoting the special everyday.

I ordered the chicken veggie bowl with teriyaki sauce. I don't know how they can even call that sauce teriyaki. It was too sweet and watery, which ruined the entire bowl with the sopping sauce. Also, the veggie list included many authentic Chinese vegetables like snow peas and bean sprouts, yet my bowl didn't have any of those and instead was filled with shredded lettuce. The chicken was dry. The only semi-authentic thing I found in my bowl was the use of green onions. I will not go back here despite the fact that I live just around the corner here, I'd rather go pretty much anywhere else.",0
_PUGXxBeY2Z9OOosFS056w,Suprisingly good food. We had rice balls and a flatbread. Two bottles of wine helped as well. Maybe not the most authentic Italian experience and a limited menu but it was good and I would go back.,1
_PUGXxBeY2Z9OOosFS056w,"Not bad for one of their first nights open. Nice crowd and great vibe. Time to table could have been a bit tighter, and what the food lacks in authenticity/creativity, (although tasty for bar food) the vibe carries the day. Prices for the food offered are appropriate !",1
_QySOnv3RBmL7GrbJ6beSw,"Phnom Penh moved so 13124 Lorain Ave is now Cuisine du Cambodge, which is run by the original owners of Phnom Penh. The renamed restaurant has now been open just 3 weeks. 

Dinner tonight was fantastic. I had the Hue Beef soup, a soup with round rice noodles, sliced pork belly, beef brisket, and flavored with lemon grass and other spices. I'm not a Cambodian food specialist but am Asian myself and have had lots of other east and south Asian food, and this had terrific spice and depth of flavor. Similarly, the Phnom Penh stirred pan noodle, which seemed like a cambodian variant of Pad Thai, was delicious. Portion size was very generous too.

Waiter and rest of staff were extremely nice and attentive. Really enjoyed the experience. Decor is perhaps a bit sparse, but clean. It adds to the authenticity of the experience, and probably allows them to keep the prices so low.",1
_QySOnv3RBmL7GrbJ6beSw,"This place is now Cuisine Du Cambodge - a Southeast Asian Restaurant which specializes in Cambodian Cuisine.

This is a must visit place, with the same awesome food as before!
Stuffed Wings are amazing! Pad Thai is the best around! Very authentic cooking!",1
_Rw3EkxvI_tJIVbnT5jT2A,"Its a bit of a hole in the wall, but the food is authentic. I got the carbonara and it was very good. But the thing you really have to try is the calamari! Some of the best I've ever tried! The atmosphere is actually really authentic. The kitchen is blended in right with the dining room. Ample amount of seating, bathrooms are limited. Service is ok, refills were far and few in between, but I'll give my waitress the benefit of the doubt this time because she looked like she was running the gelato counter and waiting tables. Maybe a little understaffed. I haven't tried the gelato yet, (I was stuffed) but I will be sure to try some on my next visit!  Also, parking is limited. You might be circling for a bit, but overall definitely try this place!",1
_Rw3EkxvI_tJIVbnT5jT2A,Completely happy! The chicken parm and Veal Marsala were amazing. Honestly the best we've ever had. Prices are fair. Service was good. The cheese garlic bread is a huge serving. Their sauces are perfection. Make sure to split a Cannoli.   So good. A local restaurant on Lorain that will surprise you. Completely authentic and even had a piano player. My new chicken parm fix when I don't feel like making it myself! Definitely recommend.,1
_Rw3EkxvI_tJIVbnT5jT2A,"My wife and I had dinner here Tuesday night. First time here, and we loved it! My wife is a picky Italian and she had the Arrabiatta with linguini and raved about the spicy sauce, very authentic and good portion. I had a nice slab of very tasty lasagna, and we both had the simple house salads. Food, service and atmosphere was excellent. We've been looking for a nice authentic Italian restaurant on the near west side ever since Maria's in Lakewood closed, and we finally found our new go-to Italian!
Great menu, and there are many choices for the type of pasta for some of the dishes which aren't specific to one type.",1
_Rw3EkxvI_tJIVbnT5jT2A,"I'm a bit surprised there's only two reviews for it. 

Caffe Roma is tucked away in the west park. It is quite small with only 10 tables in the main inside room (an adjacent room had a private party, so I don't know if it's also normally open] I never heard of it until my sister had a recommendation for it from a friend. 

The menu boasted a homemade pizza using Mama's authentic recipe. Whoever mama is, the pizza is what I've been looking for in Cleveland. $1.25 a slice; Mostly topped with diced tomatoes, some very lightly sprinkled grated cheese [parmeasan, I believe] and a light tomato sauce with some herbs sprinkled on top, delicious. 
I've seen too much of the loaded mozzarella cheese with salty tomato sauce pizza around in Cleveland and this thankfully was not it. 

Caffe Roma offers more sophisticated options than a typical Italian place at this low price range [no entree on the menu is more than $15-16]. In addition to just basic items like a type of pasta with your choice of sauces and eggplant parmasean, there a few additional items like a dish with capers, mussels, a pasta dish with red cream sauce and shrimp, and Spaghetti Carbonara [the entree, only $12]. My grandpa is a picky eater and he found it to his satisfaction. They added plenty of mushrooms and extra sauce to his plate upon his request. His main gruff was that the bread (complimentry) was not Italian, but was a set of rolls. 
I noticed no music inside, which I actually liked. 

On a Friday evening, around 6:00 PM, the place was bustling also with pickup orders, but the service never slacked off at all. The service was quite good with the 2-3 servers to the place coming by us and helping us out, and they were nice enough not to kick us out after we sat there for 10-15 minutes after paying our bill. 

You can also bring your own wine although they do now have wine there. 

A great place that has Italian food [more authentic than other places] on a cheaper budget.",1
_Rw3EkxvI_tJIVbnT5jT2A,I have to say this place is the most authentic Italian restaurant I have been to in Cleveland.  The bread tastes like the bread my grandmother used to make and the pasta is just soo delicious!  I really enjoy coming here.,1
_Rw3EkxvI_tJIVbnT5jT2A,"So NOT fair to rate this restaurant on anything other than what it is:  old style Italian food, made by old style Italians.
Do the vinyl tableclothes and casual bar make it look like you should expect a gourmet salad?  No, it screams iceberg.  So why would you order it and then Complain about it?  ( see below reviews)
One look at this place and you'll know what you should order:
Gnocchi, spaghetti, meatballs and bread.
All as authentic as any Italian grandmas kitchen.
Order things they make from scratch;  their specialties.
Delicious.",0
_Rw3EkxvI_tJIVbnT5jT2A,"Guilty pleasure:  Stuffing my face with more pasta than a 300lb man could probably eat. True story. 

Result:  Not being able to physically move my own body for about 4 hours afterwards. Totally worth it. 

If you love huge portions of hot, homemade, laid-back, authentic Italian meal as much as I do, then Caffe Roma should be on your short list of restaurants to visit. This is not a test. Sure, it's in a randomly-weird location and the parking situation is just borderline stupid (who double parks cars in their own lot, blocking customers from getting out??), but it's a favorite of mine for sure. 

No matter what your Italian-food-craving may be, Caffe Roma has it - homemade and fresh. I tend to be a creature of habit, so the spaghetti and meatballs with angel hair pasta is always on my plate. The sauce is delish, especially with a generous sprinkling of crushed red pepper flakes. It's not that the sauce needs anything extra, I just love spicy food. (Just FYI: You'd be hard-pressed to find me eating something without hot sauce or pepper flakes.)  They serve you up some freshly baked bread with your meal that is to-die-for, but who doesn't love that?  I also always get a side salad that's far from small. It's loaded up with fresh tomatoes, olives and fresh cheese. Take it from me, get the house dressing. YUM!

Oh, I almost forgot! I'm not a big dessert eater. I hate chocolate, sweets, all of it. It's just not for me. I make some exceptions for things like ice cream, gelato, sorbet, but that's about it. Both times I've been here, the server has brought out some sort of complimentary dessert for us to try. I'm always blown away, even being a sweets-hater! We were lucky enough to taste two kinds of the gelato they get from La Gelateria and the house-made tiramisu. 

My last fun fact about Caffe Roma is that it's a ""Bring your own wine/beer"" establishment. I haven't been to many places with this feature, but I've learned to love it! Honestly, it's cheaper and you're not limited to what's on a menu. Winner, winner, Italian dinner!",1
_Rw3EkxvI_tJIVbnT5jT2A,"I've been coming here since they opened in 2004. My family was actually one of their first customers! I love this place!

This place is the perfect small Italian eatery with a cozy feel to it. 

The food is amazing! Great portions, home-cooked style Italian food. My favorite is the cavatelli with meatballs, spaghetti aglio-olio, and chicken parmesan! Also definitely get a salad before the meal, the house dressing is a delicious oil and vinegar style dressing! Tiramisu is also a great finish to a wonderful meal! I recommend it!

Caffe Roma is run by a wonderful Italian family, and the service is great! Always friendly and make you feel right at home!

If you live in the area, don't miss this wonderful gem of a restaurant! Try it!",1
_Rw3EkxvI_tJIVbnT5jT2A,"My husband raved how good the food was here. I wanted olive garden. But,nooo..he insisted we go here. 
    Needless to say...not impressed in the least. Very outdated, dirty,and I was cringing on the inside. To appease this man of mine, I gave it a try. We ordered wedding soup, mozzarella sticks,andpizza.I ordered angel hair with marinara,and he ordered eggplant parm. It was a whole pound of boxed pasta with out of the jar ragu sauce. The soup was ok. Microwaved no doubt. 
     Our waitressnever came over...not once while we were eating to see how things tasted. She sat talking with some guy the whole time. Then, some guy who worked there was out working on his car out back, kept coming in and out huffing and puffing whilst mumbling under his breath.
    45 dollars later plus a tip.... Not worth it. Definitely not authentic Italian food.",0
_Rw3EkxvI_tJIVbnT5jT2A,"Not at all what we expected!  I decided I wanted something hearty, so we decided on Italian.  My husband and I have Friday Night Dinner with my mother each week and we went to Yelp to point us in the right direction...AND did they ever.

I never expected authentic, comfort Italian food on Lorain Avenue in cleveland, but it's exactly what we got and it was Amazing!  They offer a full bar with casual seating, family friendly and a simple menu.

Greeted the moment we walked in, we felt like we were at home.  Our server was great, very attentive and always checking in.  

We started with a few glasses of wine, soup and three HEARTY appetizers.  We went on to order three entrees and never expected to finish everything but we managed.

The pasta fagiol and Italian wedding soups were homemade, just like Nona would make.  The garlic bread was so soft and full of flavor, especially with the addition of warm marinara.  We also had mozzarella sticks and two-dozen mussels, the tomato broth was so good, I had to sopp it up with garlic bread!  

My mother loved her eggplant parmigiana with spaghetti, oozing with fresh provolone!  My husband went basic too, chicken parmigiana with fresh cavatelli!  I chose the seafood linguini, shrimp, clams, mussels and octopus in a red sauce with garlic!  Our meals were delicious!  

If you are looking for authentic Italian food In cleveland, this is it and I was shocked when we got our check and it was well under what we thought it should cost!  Great food, outstanding service...we will definitely be back!",1
02E9r4BQzVrA76Bf7G-KMw,"I'm on the fence with this one. Let me be clear, however, that I have never been on-site. I've had their food twice via Grubhub and have to summarize my findings based on that:

1) Their pepperoni pizza (I had some onion splashed on mine) is great! I mean in a, ""Hey, I'm kinda hungover and need some greasy food that tastes good"" kinda way. It's not authentic, it's not gourmet, it's not this, it's not that. It's greasy, good-tasting pizza. So if you are some kind of pizza hipster snob, keep your trap shut. There are plenty of Yelp reviews eluding to what it is. You have been ""warned"". :p

2) Their sandwiches are pretty good. They, again, aren't EXTREMELY good but they are good. If you're a food snob, you'll find something wrong with them. If you're hungry  and a sandwich has crossed your mind, there ya go.

3) The salads are lame. I won't go into the inner-workings of salads. Let's just say that they are ill-conceived and overpriced. 

Of the two orders, I've not received an order from Edison's via Grubhub any less than an hour late. I don't know who is to blame for this but I SUSPECT this is Edison's deal. Just a heads up.",0
0jHZk9RrKh0uRhTRW1XIqQ,"Nice, authentic middle eastern (I want to say Moroccan) feel. My husband loved his lamb and rice dish, and I ordered the tea and freshly made French cookies, both of which were delicious. We were also served freshly made bread as an appetiser.",1
0jHZk9RrKh0uRhTRW1XIqQ,"I love a personal touch, and on top of great food and service, this place has just become a favorite of mine. 

The menu is small, but amazingly well done. The cuisine is Moroccan, and for us, was served by the chef himself in a friendly, welcoming way. 

The kebab is amazing; flavorful, simple and tasty, with wonderful rice and grilled vegetables that will make mouths WATER. (I especially loved the eggplant, and my wife, who is not always a veggie fan, loved every bit.) All of the platter meals are served with hot half-loaves of a tasty grain bread, and side salads festooned with olives and a wonderful lemon vinaigrette. 

The drink menu is mostly only water, but if you get a chance, here's a tip; order the green mint tea. Served in a long-pour Moroccan style,(by the owner himself.) It's tasty, soothing, sweet and minty. My wife and I agreed next time, we get TWO pots! 

To top it off, we got some of the house cookies, which are classic stuff; nutty, tasty and really a great way to finish off the meal. 

Parking here is a bit sparse, but there's a great parking garage behind the building (city run) that's very safe and not too expensive at all. 

So, if you're looking for a treat and want something authentic and well done, try this little place on Lee Road. To sum up, I can only say this; when it comes to Kebab, MAKE MINE MOMO'S !!",1
0jHZk9RrKh0uRhTRW1XIqQ,"A nice intimate space with authentic food. The food is prepared fresh, the flavors are simple yet delicious, and the prices are reasonable. I had the harisa soup, the Kefta sandwich, and the Moroccan mint tea. The kefta was tender and savory. The side salad that comes with the sandwich is simply dressed with olive oil, herbs, and lemon - very good. Momo makes his own whole wheat bread - delicious. Oh, and the mint tea has a terrific aftertaste. Definitely recommend.",1
0jHZk9RrKh0uRhTRW1XIqQ,"Amazing authentic restaurant! Everything about this place was fantastic---small cozy well decorated place, the friendly host/chef, the great value for your meal. And the food was excellent from start finish---don't miss the mint tea or the sweet cookies for dessert. The salad and bread were so fresh. Our entrees were so delicious. One of the best ethnic restaurants in CLE---truly a hidden gem in Cleveland Heights!!! You must try this place!",1

0jHZk9RrKh0uRhTRW1XIqQ,On a Sunday night we were looking for someplace yummy to eat and came across this place on yelp. The reviews don't lie it was very very good. The place was cozy and welcoming with an authentic style. We started off with the moroccan tea which was minty and sweet. Then we got the tazine and lamb. Both were different but very good. The meat was not dry very soft and moist also full of spices. We will come back here again. Ohh and the owner is moroccan and he is the cook and makes everything fresh.,1
0jHZk9RrKh0uRhTRW1XIqQ,"A new gem on cedar lee restaurant row. Looks a little mom and poppy, authentic looking Moroccan plush seats right up front. Got chicken kebab salad, beef kebab platter and green bean and carrot side dish. Didn't care that much for the green bean and carrot salad, small plate Twas just ok. Lightly seasoned with some herbs. Meals also came with fresh baked whole wheat herb bread. I try not to indulge in too much bread at meals but it was warm and fresh and unlike any typical roll (no butter available but it paired nice when dipping it in olive oil). For the chicken kebab salad I only got like 4 chicken medallion but the meat was tender and flavor town! The salad dressing was a  nice lemon flavor but could have used more. The beef kebab platter came with roasted veggies (eggplant tomato) and revved up rice. Meat itself was a little dry but again if the flavor could tweet it would say #boom. 

Great place will defintely come again. Prices were reasonable. I didn't feel stuffed at the end though. Unfortunately their acclaimed tangine dish is only available on Saturdays and per the owner runs out fast, however if you call ahead he will set one aside for you.",1

A Friday lunch excursion led a few coworkers and I here on a Friday afternoon. This place had been on the list of places I wanted to check out for a while. 

Upon entering the restaurant you notice the decor which looks fairly authentic. The front of the restaurant has a setup that looks like it's straight from a Moroccan market. Equip with pillows and areas to enjoy Moroccan mint tea. The menu was very condensed and to the point. It made the choices of items easy the pick from. The tangine is only served on the weekend and if orders during the week, it must be pre ordered at least a day in advance. So this time I ordered the beef kefta  with couscous and veggies. The sever was very helpful and friendly. The food took a fair amount of time to prepare but it was fresh and not too busy so this was acceptable. The beef kefta was cooked very well. It almost got to the point of being overlooked but it was just perfect. The meat was seasoned with a good amount of cumin so if you aren't a fan of this spice you'll probably want to stay away. The couscous combined well with the meat and veggies and also I requested a spicy sauce on the side. It wasn't very spicy but the taste was appropriate.  Overall the meal was very filling and made for a healthy meal. I'd def give this place another visit to check out the tangine .",1
0jHZk9RrKh0uRhTRW1XIqQ,"Most amazing authentic Moroccan cuisine prepare by Chef MoMo and his wife Khadija We had the Beef platter and Vegan platters and they were delicious. Also, the Moroccan green tea and cookies. Everything was 5 stars all the way especially the service and hospitality.",1
0jHZk9RrKh0uRhTRW1XIqQ,"Well, it just doesn't get much better than this. Our first (and certainly not last) Momo's experience hit all of our most prized dining-out criteria:

- Simple, fresh, and healthfully prepared foods
- An authentic ethnic food experience
- Extraordinary value for the price point
- Warm, welcoming service

This place does just a few things and does them WELL. Homemade flatbreads with simple ingredients, fresh, lean marinated meats. Simple grilled veggies. Hot, strong, sweet mint tea. Homemade cookies. That's the bulk of the menu and it's all delightful. Bonus: you could easily get out of Momo's, satisfied, for about $10.00 per person. Perfect!",1
0jHZk9RrKh0uRhTRW1XIqQ,"Absolutely enjoyed Momo's! Came here twice within a week because they have specials on the weekends that aren't offered during the weekday. 

Momo and his wife are extremely hospitable and bring you a true taste of Morocco, with authentic tea pouring experience and delicious food. Each kebab platter will be extremely filling!! I highly recommend the kefta kebabs, served with rice, roasted veggies, bread, and fattoush salad. They also make their own fresh harissa, extremely spicy but also addicting. Each dish averages ~10$ and I think it's super worth your money! 
On weekends, they serve stews and lamb dishes. These are v yummy as well!!! 


Momo definitely made a genuine effort to make us feel welcomed and enjoy our meal. Will be back soon!",1
0jHZk9RrKh0uRhTRW1XIqQ,"I love the freshness of the food. Momo and his wife are creating and serving food made from scratch and with love. I have been to Morocco and must say this place is very authentic.
It is a simple little place on Lee road with a small but good menu. On weekends Momo makes a delicious tagine. My husband loves the lamb and my go to dish are the kÁE¶fte. All meals include a super fresh salad and home baked bread.
Please note that the place does not have ac. Some people might be bothered by this, but we're headed into Fall now and this should not be an issue. The food is well worth it and the prices are very reasonable",1

0-jqS5y4D-6Zohb3Q375ZQ,"Ninja City is a bar that happens to serve Asian food.  And their take on Asian food is decent.  My group of three had two ramens, a Korean rice bowl, a pho and some appetizers.  The chicken wings and pot stickers were sub par and should be skipped.  The steam buns were OK.  The soups and rice bowls were good,  not really authentic but close enough.  Fried ice cream,  the only dessert,  was like a deep fried pancake with sliver of ice cream.  It should definitely be avoided, especially with Sweet Moses next door.

Prices are on the high side, but you pay for the atmosphere, which is somewhere between college dive bar and urban cafe.  The servers, like the clientele,  are young, hipster types who are fairly attentive and always moving.  The place seems very  appropriate for Gordon Square and ninja city should do much better than their previous location at Case.",0
0-jqS5y4D-6Zohb3Q375ZQ,"Ok ok ok...

Sorry to be the bummer yelp reviewer.

I travel throughout the country and thought this place would be better than Noodlecat... that bar is pretty low. 

First, I am from SE Asia. What they have as Spicy Green Papaya salad... is not authentic and to be honest it's really disrespectful to the Laos, Khmer, and Thai culture. What I had... should Even be called spicy papaya salad. 

I wanted to report this to the chef or manager but it was basically talking to someone who is not from SE Asia to explain how this papaya salad should have been made.

The ramen....... broth was bland and no chaschu? One bite everyone knows the rules 2.3 out of 10... really bad. Who Calls COUnTRY Ham and put in Ramen and call it PORK BELLY?!?!???!? Disappointed and I guess it's how the Land do it here..

Cup of noodles had more flavor.

Pro Tip: Only saving grace was the dumplings but i suspect it was frozen ....
Only appealing for one type of demographic.
I would be scared to try their PHO....",0
0-jqS5y4D-6Zohb3Q375ZQ,"I've been here three or four times and every time is an amazing experience. The food is so thought out, affordable and delicious with an Asian twist. Cocktails were perfectly balanced and we loved the clever names on the menu. The decor and all of the details right down to the menu are super authentic to what I would call a 13-year-old boys dream restaurant with video game memorabilia and superheroes galore! The owners came right to our table and made sure that our kids had kid friendly everything to eat and drink and made a great recommendations that are very picky eating children loved. They even filled up the video games with as many free rounds as the kids wanted! The chef even came out to the table to check on how we liked everything. It was over the top and awesome experience and one reason why chain restaurants have such a hard time beating local Cleveland gems like this.",1
0OKlVYVOjCiZcgxlyBuEeQ,"Great location for downtown business travelers or tourists. The hotel itself has been modernized but still feels a bit dated like so many of the buildings in Downtown Cleveland. I see this authenticity as a plus although I could see where travelers accustomed to generic brand new buildings might not fully appreciate the history in a place like this.

Staff was very friendly and helpful. Check-in was quick and easy. Breakfast was standard for the Marriott chain, which is actually pretty good.

Another poster said the parking lot was scary. It is not scary in a personal saftey sense but more in an ""oh crap, I should've gotten the rental insurance"" sense. You can find garages just like this all over New York and I'm sure there are a few more around Cleveland. Just make sure you get a small car or, since there's so much within walking distance and ample public transit, just forego the car and take a taxi or shuttle to/from the airport. 

Overall, I thought this was a great hotel.

BTW, if you *want* to see a scary garage, head to the parking garage two blocks west of this hotel (I think - it's caddy corner from 45 Prospect). Take a ride in the elevator-of-doom, then pick a floor and wander around. See how many potholes and broken down 20-year old video surveillance cameras covered in cobwebs you can count. Enjoy the urine/ammonia combo wafting through the air. Then find the stairs (because the elevator has probably broken down again by now anyway) - the ones that say 'Emergency Exit Only'. Go all the way down to the first floor exit and walk out. It's a scene straight from Escape From New York. Enjoy.",1

It was once a gathering place, and a real cafe where people actually interacted with one another rather than with screens. The new sterile look with all white and minimal decor is just creepy.",0
0ZPuFZMMYfRa3FRfjddCDA,"Received a free lobster dinner with my total rewards card from the casino. Showed up on a Thursday around eight o clock at night and there was an extremely long line. Luckily my friend is a diamond player and we had our own line with only one couple in front of us. As soon as we were checking in we were advised they were all out of lobster. I guess you have to get there early before they run out. Guess we weren't the only ones lured in with an empty promise for a free lobster tail. We were seated by the hostess after about a five minute wait. The weirdest thing was they seated another table of two before us when we were clearly next in line. We were told after we were seated that we could start eating and our drinks would be there shortly. There was several stations, one for desert, Asian, American, Italian, carving (prime rib, turkey, corned beef etc) and maybe one more that had a mix of different kinds of items, all the best stations had lines (carving and American). Round one was salmon, meatloaf, risotto, some kind of pasta dish and a wedge salad with blue cheese and bacon. By the time I got back to the table, ate all my food (was all pretty good and I haven't ate a bite in nine hours and I was starving) still no drinks. I got up to go get some Asian (looks good but is bland, not authentic and a complete waste of time) our drinks still haven't arrived. I had to wave a server down, ask for drinks and still waited another ten minutes. This really pissed me off and I'm getting upset again right now while writing this review. They lost a star for service and I shouldn't have left any tip.

Since I didn't eat my Asian I went in for round 3 on some ribs (surprisingly very good) turkey with mashed potatoes and gravy (waited five minutes for the gravy to heat up on the grill) another F for fail for the wait staff who convinced me they can care less about my dining experience. My friends said the corned beef was really good and it looked good but I can't confirm because they were out and lied and said more would be out soon and never came. FAIL...

Desert was really good, I had mini cupcakes (yummy) cheesecake (melting) but flavor was good and a make your own sundae. You will love this concept, maybe ten different ice cream flavored to choose from (vanilla, strawberry and choc chip) was very good ice cream. Topped how I like. I was stuffed but I need to gripe more about the service. This is a strong word but I hate their service. Their staff seems to be purposely trying to lose customers. I have never had this many service disasters in one experience. They should all be fired and replaced with people who care. That is all",0
0ZZIqTdEb7yUa13QZLKuGQ,"I want to give 21 lounge a good review, I really do.  I like small start up businesses, with a good environment and great food.  But unfortunately a few things didn't match up to a 5 rating so I'm giving it a solid 4 instead.

A co-worker and I read many reviews from restaurants in the area before deciding on 21 Lounge on the final evening of our trip.  We had previously eaten at Winking Lizard, Hodge's and Butcher and the Barrel.  I saw a fried egg burger on the menu and it looked like it would hit the spot so off we went.

The night of our visit, there was a Cavs game starting within 2 hours, so traffic was already buzzing and we expected the place to be pretty packed.  The location of the entry isn't clear.  We, and plenty of others, thought it was located on the corner under the big sign... So when we walked in, it was EMPTY.  There were three guys sitting at the bar and only one table was seated. Immediate thought... Uh-oh... But we held in there.  The place has some great reviews on the food, it was rush hour, and Yelp advertised a 10% off discount for checking in, which I did. 

Having previously had buffalo wings at the Winking Lizard, I was still craving them a bit so I ordered that as an appetizer.  YUM.  Probably not the absolute best most original authentic wings I've ever had but they were delicious.  They were served with a homemade, secret recipe ranch dressing, a recipe that they apparently acquired from Alvie's, a closed restaurant famous in the area.  The ranch was good.  It did taste homemade, a definite note of real dill on my first taste, but other than that, I just dipped my wings in it and the wing sauce pretty much over powered it.  The only thing about the wings, it would have been nice to have a celery garnish included and you actually had to pay a dollar extra for the ranch.  :/  I would have been happy with regular ranch for free.  

Next up, I ordered, as anticipated by the menu on Yelp, the fried egg burger.  I pretty much expected the ""easy over egg"" (as described on the menu) to run all over the burger when I bit into it.... I was really looking forward to that part.  Didn't happen.  The egg was somewhere between over medium and hard cooked.  Other than that, the burger was pretty good.  I think the bun was brioche and it really enjoyed that nice touch.  

The burger was served with fries.  21 Lounge serves an upgrade called 21 Fries for a $1 more.  They tasted really good, but unfortunately I had to salt them a little.  The 21 fries are tossed with raw garlic, rough grated parmesan cheese and fresh herbs and served with chipotle ketchup.  The other flavors totally over powered the ""chipotle"" that was in the ketchup.  Like I said, the fries were good... What was NOT so good, was walking back to my hotel with a strong overwhelming taste of garlic resounding in my mouth.  Honestly, I brushed my teeth right when I walked back in the hotel room, and could still prominently taste it even the next morning before brushing again.  So if it's a date night or important business dinner, you may want to rethink the fry upgrade.  If you LOVE garlic, then go for it.  I'm sure plenty do.

After a while, the waitress brought the check.  I'm guessing she was an owner because she seemed to be really knowledgable and mature for a waitress.  She had also been kind enough to point out that the table we chose near the window tends to get pretty cold.  That was a nice tidbit to know prior to sitting down. At some point through the meal, I had pointed out my phone showing the Yelp 10% discount.  I didn't notice until after she had already swiped my card that the Yelp discount had not been applied.  Sure I could have said something, but I had already waited long enough for her to pick up our credit cards, and, seriously, even longer for her to bring them back so I just said screw it and signed.  

Moral of the story, I liked this place.  There were some flaws, some things I wish may have gone a little differently, but all in all, it was a great place to grab a bite, especially if you're headed to a Cavs game.  Food was good, didn't take too long, and is definitely higher caliber than your typical bar food.",0
10Jk5ilimXrfAq8JJ1gISg,"Went here with my family after being curious that this place opened next to two other Pho places. The decor is very nice. Hardwood floors, leather seats, very clean. They really fixed up the place! They also have a patio out but it's unfinished. That wouldve been nice if it was fixed up. 

There were four of us. We ordered their vermicelli with pork and shrimp, beef noodle soup with meatballs and got some drinks: Thai iced tea and tri-color dessert. 

First of all, the meat is cooked perfectly but their noodle soup is a bit different compared to other places. The broth is lighter and  there is hardly any taste of the beef. It's definitely healthier but for me, I liked the actual taste of the authentic beef broth. 

Their ""Thai iced tea"" is NOT Thai iced tea. It tastes just like the Asian black jelly drink with loads of sugar. The ones you buy in the cans at the market. Last time i had Thai iced tea, the color was orange, not dark red. Their tri-color dessert was on the other hand delicious. It had the right amount of coconut milk, red beans, and tri-color jellies. 

Overall the prices are kind of the same everywhere. The regular size for both were about $6-7. The service was fine and it's a great place to bring a date. They had a TV but no music playing in the background. They did however had small children there which I found a bit odd since it's a place of business not a playground. 

The only thing that stood out to me is that they have banh mi so I may come back to try that.",0

I think however I am not a fan of Indian fusion. 
I sometimes think that things should remain the same. It is hard enough trying to find an authentic Indian restaurant (I miss my friend who would invite me to her home for home cooked Indian cuisine), but putting the 'fusion' spin..
Okay I guess. ..for those who are unfamiliar.",1

The salad was good, quiche was nicely cooked, and there was a good assortment of breads, sandwiches, and desserts. The lemon curd sauce is especially lovely.

This is not the place if you are looking for authentic asian flavor or preparation but the noodles and the pork were very good and fresh. Definitely a fusion approach. The ramen portion was hearty for the price and more noodle than broth. The pork bun is overpriced. The line was very slow. I would eat there again.",1
18b_QEiqTD7cwJTLjNgw3g,"Noodlecat has the unfortunate advantage of being one of the sole ramen experiences in Cleveland. The joint looks like a winner, seems to have all the ingredients that would lead to success - the logo is adorable, service is not bad, and the menu items read appetizing and creative. But the nasty consequence of having no competition is just that - Noodlecat does not have to try. Marketing ""Asian fusion"" while serving instant noodles in bland, flavorless broth makes me question whether the chef understands what Asian fusion is - or if he has ever had real, authentic ramen to begin with.

You can't create a fusion restaurant without first understanding the authentic roots of the cuisine you serve. And Noodlecat is nowhere near where they need to be. I ordered the Crispy Short Rib Ramen. New experience: I didn't think it was possible to wash out the flavor of kimchi before trying this dish. 

Ramen isn't about noodles so much as it is about broth, and this dark broth tasted like hot water - I had to ask the waitress for salt. Noodles were crimped and flavorless like instant noodles. The short ribs were tough, bland, and doused in a greasy sauce. 

We also ordered pork steam buns - bun was wet and greasy, messy to eat. They spritzed our edamame with lemon and something else; a bold move, but it didn't do much for my palate.

Why is Noodlecat still around despite less than stellar food? Probably because they offer a cheap ""almost ramen"" to clientele that do not know better. I guarantee this place would not survive in a bigger city, where it would have to answer to competition, or at the very least, a more diverse population that won't stand for bland broth. 

I really wanted to like Noodlecat as a native Clevelander, but until their chef gets it together, they are a no-go for me. It is unfair not to make an effort just  because you can. I hope in the future they'll do Cleveland justice and step it up.",0

- Pineapple bun (bo lo bao): Very crispy layer of pineapple-flavored crust on top of a piece of bread. 
- Crispy bun with sour vegetables and pork: this sounds very unappetizing, but trust me, it is bomb[dot]com :D
- Pork sun rice roll: this is like a large sushi, with pork sun in the middle! I love pork sun in anything, so this was pretty much a given. 
All of the pastries are priced around $1, so they're very affordable! 

This is one of the few places that sell bubble tea in Cleveland, which kinda sucks :( I loved getting my weekly fix of boba back in LA, but Koko just doesn't do it for me, unfortunately! I've gotten the taro, Thai, Hong Kong, strawberry, and honeydew milk teas. All of them were hugely disappointing because they were just too sweet.

1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw,"I absolutely love this place. I've been here 3 or 4 times since I discovered it, and I have to say I'm definitely in love. The bubble tea is decently priced (coming from other areas with delicious but crazy overpriced bubble tea) and delicious. I have yet to try the food there, but the fresh-made bread is so good! Very authentic. You can get all the sweets, cakes, and pastries you can think of here, too. I can't wait to try all of this stuff...if I could I'd come here every day. The service and people are very nice. They are willing to explain things to you if you don't know what it is or if you're unsure of what to get. And it is by far the cleanest Chinese/Asian bakery place I've been to recently. If I had to complain about something, it's the hours. It closes at 7, which is usually too early for my bubble tea craving to set in, and they only take credit card charges if you buy more than $5, but that's typical of smaller businesses. In short, GO! You won't regret it!",1
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw,"Stopped in here to check out the place and seemed like an authentic Asian bakery. I had the coconut roll -- delicious bread pastry filled with a sugar, coconut mixture. I've heard the bubble tea is good too, so I'll probably be back in the near future.",1
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw,"So awesome.

I only got to make a *super* quick stop in here to pick up pastries for an event and I was blown away. Everything here is amazing and presented beautifully.

We ordered a big box containing these standouts:
+ Chocolate cream bun
+ Green tea pastry box (4 cookies with green tea filling)
+ Fruit Tart
+ Lemon bun
+ Meltaway bars
+ Strawberry bun 
+ Bubble teas (I had the original milk tea. Super satisfying!)

Everything was truly delicious. We were all sharing bites and stealing from each other. We felt so sick afterward but had zero regrets. This is an authentic Asian bakery at its finest, with colorful and interesting desserts, pastries, bubble teas and other treats. I believe the owner is a woman, and it is so clear the dedication put into this business. Picking up pastries for my event from here was an excellent choice. It was a nice change for us and everyone loved them. For me, the buns were really a highlight...the chocolate cream bun was rich, decadent and tasty. I hope to come back soon and stay in the bakery to relax and enjoy!",1
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw,"Please bear with me while I make this bold statement: Koko bakery is not an Asian bakery or Chinese bakery. It is a Taiwanese bakery. The owner is Taiwanese. The little pastry buns in the glass display case are your stereotypical Taiwanese flavors. The ""quick meals"" are typical Taiwanese meals you get from a food stall. The moon cakes, meat buns, veggie buns, mango shaved ice, all scream Taiwanese. Let's be clear about this, and perhaps you'll evaluate it from a different standard.

The pastry are what you can expect to get from an average bakery in Taiwan. Hot dog, dried pork, wedges of boiled egg in a bun - it's not sweet, it's not really pastry, (it's a hot dog bun, let's be real) but every pastry shop has it. Buns with green onions and pork jerky? Sounds quirky, but 100% Taiwanese. Those are all very local flavors. 

Previous yelpers have commented on the quality of the tea - so I won't repeat here. Please see Michael C, NY's review on what makes a good cup of milk tea.

I haven't seen a whole lot of comment on the sticky rice ball é£¯ç³° so I'll pitch in here. Today is my first time trying it at koko - what do you know, a pregnant lady craves food out of her norm. The fillings are all correct ingredients of a Taiwanese rice ball flavor - diced dry turnip, fried Chinese donut, and dried pork powder. But the rice is wrong. Way wrong. You should be able to taste each grain of rice yet at the same time each grain soft and sticky so the ball doesn't fall apart. 

So you see the whole time I was consuming this rice ball I felt very conflicted. I kept chasing the flavor produced by the internal fillings, because it's the flavor ingrained in the memory; and kept rejecting the texture of the external ""wall of mushy rice"", because it's not what I associate with a rice ball. Before you know it, I finished this rice ball and I don't know whether to laugh or cry.

This is the only Taiwanese-owned eatery/bakery in Cleveland, and pretty darn authentic. I've heard rumor that's there's going to be a Taiwanese tea house but I haven't seen it materialized.

-----update -----
Fellow yelper CH Y. let me know that the new teahouse is opened-
Vintage Tea and Coffee

I haven't had the pleasure to try it yet. Some day.",0
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw,"Coming to Cleveland from New York I was surprised to find an authentic Chinese bakery.  The quality and variety of the breads and buns are just as good those found in Flushing.  I particularly like the sesame paste buns.  The fresh fruit cakes are also great - light, spongy and not too sweet.  I like to stop by for a snack and bubble tea in the afternoon.",1
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw,"I can't believe I've never reviewed this place. I've been here countless times throughout the years. They are the only Asian bakery in Cleveland and they don't disappoint. I'd have to say that the best thing Koko offers is their buns. They are affordable and delicious. My favorite ones are the curry beef puffs. Unfortunately on the day I came there were not many buns available. 

I enjoy their bubble tea, but it definitely is not authentic or comparable to other bubble tea shops. Some flavors taste very artificial. I typically order taro or Thai tea with rainbow jelly instead of bubbles. I don't usually try the small desserts or cakes that they have in the display counters because it is overpriced, but whenever I do splurge on one they are always delicious.

Kokos is a great place to buy snacks and dessert and is in a convenient location. I always stop by after grocery shopping or eating a meal in AsiaTown and will continue to do so.",1
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw,"This is my favorite bakery. Hits those cravings for authentic, soft, delicious Chinese bread. My personal favorites are the cheesy vegetable bun, pork sung pineapple bun, and chocolate cream bun. Family favorites are the green onion or milk butter loafs. The cakes are super yummy too-lots of fruit with a lightly sweetened fluffy buttercream! Overall, not too sweet like American cakes. 

The service is great and though I've always bought my items to enjoy at home, the atmosphere is  perfect and cozy for some afternoon bubble tea. The furniture is bright and there's a lot of natural lighting! 

Would highly recommend.",1
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw,"I'm cuckoo for Koko buns! This Asian bakery always puts out quite a spread, making it difficult to choose exactly how I'd like to stuff my face. The real stars here are the buns- Some are topped, others stuffed, while another group still are split down the middle and filled with cream. There are savory options, too! No matter which type you choose they are delicious, but the coconut ones will always be my favorite. They serve other pastries, boba and rice bowls, as well. 

The other news about this amazing bakery and cafe is that they now offer more substantial meals in a dining room next door. I hadn't been to Koko in a while, so discovered this just today, when stopping in during lunch hour. The menu was VERY extensive, including both authentic dishes and American Chinese favorites. Also, at just $6.95, their lunch combos are a steal!

I tried the cucumbers with garlic as an appetizer, followed by rice noodles with beef for a main course. To say that they were delicious is a total understatement- the beef might have been some of the tastiest I've ever had! Plus, it came in a portion only a competitive eater might have been able to finish, so I'll be able to enjoy it again during round two later this evening. The cukes were crisp and refreshing, also coming in a portion large enough to share. 

Our food came out lightning fast, making this a perfect choice for lunch hour. Can't wait to return to try their noodle soups and hotpot!",1
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw,"Only decent asian bakery in the area.

This place is an ok place to go for asian pastries and baked goods.  The drinks are more below average- average depending on what you get.  The desert on the other hand were delishhhh.  

The atmosphere is mostly students in the area that come to hang out and grab a quick bite to eat kind of place.  I do love their baked goods in the main self serve display, but all the good ones are always gone... The only thing that got me was that the baked goods weren't even warm, but more on the cold side.  They charge you 80 cents to microwave the damn things.  so unnecessary...  The vietnamese ice coffee doesn't really taste authentic, but it does its job of providing you with caffeine lol.  

All in all i recommend this place to a person who hasn't been to or had these types of pastries and such.  Don't set your expectations too high before walking into this place.",0
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw,"This is probably the best Chinese bakery in the city and I have tried near and far (including restaurants and supermarkets!) 
They have a wide selection of baked goods. My favorites are the bbq pork bun (finally a good ratio of meat to bread), beef curry puff donut, and taro bread. 
They also have the traditional Taiwanese sticky rice donut rolls (with pork floss and pickled turnip) -- I devoured it because I never say no to this breakfast item... however the donut was overly fried and sorta stale which was sad. 

I spend way too much money here but I never regret it. This reminds me of home and that's priceless.",1
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw,"I'm in town visiting family and was doing some research to find some cute little cool spots to grab some snacks from. Let me tell you, I'm so glad I came across this place!

I walked in and was blown away at the selection they offer. Everything from buns and pastries, to bubble tea and rice dishes. They have something for everyone! 

I came in and grabbed a few BBQ pork buns, a taro pastry, a red bean bun, and a beef curry pastry. So far I've inly tried the BBQ pork bun and beef curry pastry. Both are excellent and have a lot of filling! The beef curry pastry reminded me of a Jamaican beef patty. Really good stuff! I also got a Thai tea with boba. I thought it would be authentic but all of that stuff is just powdered. It's still good though. Give it a try! I walked out with 5 buns and a Thai tea for $11 and I'm stuffed.",1
1FK7hoiPMPEPG0bRL4bi9Q,"Since I am not Chinese, and have only experienced it a few times, I can confidently say that I am not a dim sum connoisseur; however, based upon my experience last Sunday, I can say that Tom makes some pretty tasty dim sum. I went with a friend who speaks Cantonese and already knows the place pretty well, so I didn't even have to worry about looking through the menu or ordering anything. I just sat down and indulged! Basically, they offer a plethora of rice and noodle dumplings stuffed with different items, such as shrimp, beef, chicken, etc. 

If you are sick of all the Americanized Chinese food offered in the suburbs, head over to Cleveland's Chinatown and try out Tom's for a more authentic experience. I will warn there are a few items they serve that average Americans may find ""exotic"" or ""weird."" Like the chicken feet. Just try it.  I swear, its good.",1

1gQrMs-I8oKg2p-iRxznzQ,"I'm giving this place 3.5 stars for our first try. We got a gift certificate from our landlord for Soho so we decided to try out their brunch. I will say that it has a pretty cool atmosphere and nice patio.

When you arrive, you get 4 complimentary biscuits with butter and jam. The biscuits were a little small and not soft. As for the dishes, I think they weren't bad...but I would say that if you're expecting authentic southern food, that's not what you'll find here. It wasn't mind blowing. The hubs got the chicken and waffles. We asked if it was bone in, and it's boneless. Overall, he liked the way they fried it. The bourbon sauce though was way too sugary, so he didn't put it on his dish.

I had the southern benedict. It had pretty good flavor. But, I do think it was overpriced for the size of the dish.

I would come back for appetizers or drinks at night, probably won't be back for brunch or dinner though.",0

1KRnx1P4gYlkpmezGTERaA,"""Free Sushi Fridays?""  Really?  Free?  On Friday we all headed to Touch Supper Club to try out this mythical free sushi.  We soon realized though, that one cannot subsist on free sushi alone.  I was wondering what the catch to having a free sushi night was, and this is it:  Sure the sushi is free, but it takes a long time to be made, and when it does get served it is on a platter that will give 7-10 people enough pieces to make it like an appetizer.  Considering how many people actually are at the bar on Fridays, that does not allow for a lot of people to eat sushi at any time.  

The sushi itself, pretty good.  They have the California-type rolls with faux crab and avocado, some tuna rolls, as well as some nice flavorful sashimi.  

For dinner itself, the meals I tried weren't too impressive.  The Korean burger, while tasty, is not Korean!  Said by my Korean friend herself.  The burger is marinated in a teriyaki-like sauce, with pickled veggies Japanese-style (daikon and carrot).  At the very least, I was hoping for a bulgogi type marinade, or kimchi instead of sweet pickled daikon and carrot.  I mean sure, just the fact that you are asking for a Korean burger is not crying out for authenticity, but really, no element in this burger was Korean at all.  

I also had some of the grilled cheese sandwich, which was very filling, and came with some tomato bisque and fries.  All decent tasting, but I'm not sure I'd go here again for a $10 grilled cheese sandwich when I could probably get a better tasting grilled cheese sandwich for about the same price at Melt.

My main problem with the food is that it took a long time to actually get served to us.  We were starving and it took forever to just get our appetizers.  The server also did not count out the number of extra glasses and silverware settings we needed, so we had to ask for extra settings to get any water or silverware for those lacking it.",0
1ktw2saTrIr_YJSxQjhnpg,A super nice family owned restaurant. This place is really a gem. Whether you are looking for regular American food or authentic Egyptian-middle eastern food this is the place to go. Try the Koshari (staple Egyptian food) and you will not regret it. The place is very clean too!,1
1ktw2saTrIr_YJSxQjhnpg,"Absolutely awesome place with a unique concept. It's breakfast meets traditional east coast deli meets authentic Egyptian fare right on the Cleveland Clinic's campus. 

I had the hummus (which was uber fresh and could immediately tell was made in house) to start, then followed things with the ""Rocky Balboa"" sandwich. Mr. Balboa offered a blend of corned beef and pastrami that was super reminiscent of a deli that you'll catch in NYC. The service was awesome with two of the owners in the building and while I had my heart set on some delicious corned beef, I'm more than stoked to check out their Egyptian cuisine the next time I'm back in CLE!",1

1-lPZQQnW1P0Z7diUHb4vw,"Came to Desi101 for a last minute graduation party set up- everything from the service to the food was EXCEPTIONAL. We had a party of about 16 people which is usually hard to accommodate, but the staff pulled through ( the owner is part of the staff and on a side note- truly a humbling experience to have the service we did).

For appetizers, we had four servings of mirchi bajji and spicy chicken. If you're a spice lover or love the taste or chili chicken- highly highly recommend the spicy chicken!! For the main courses, in order from "" would travel 1000 miles to try again,"" to "" love completely,"" it would be 1) andhra style chicken 2) biriyani 3) Gutti Vankai 4) mutton. On a side note, you can order the biriyani as a vegetable biriyani or chicken biriyani and in general, the restaurant is vegetarian friendly. For sides, the regular Naan is wonderful, but you can honestly skip it and get the garlic naan instead ( just tastes better with everything). 

Lastly, because we had no room to eat and just wanted to stay longer, I ordered the mango lassi. If you have a sweet tooth like me, and really love the authentic feel of mango.... don't skip out on it!!!

Overall, it was a great experience and if you want the backstory of two CSU students starting a restaurant Indian business out of college, you should ask them!! Wonderful people with a wonderful business",1
1SJiW_mW6IlEe7hqMTnjYg,"I'm a tough critic because I'm Chinese. The Hot and sour soup and the egg roll was my favorite. Had a combo bourbon chicken which was just ok, I could have used more broccoli and moister chicken. The combo came with pork fried rice and the egg roll at a good price so I'll keep trying their food. Next time I'll try something more authentic and see how it goes.

1v9TVINzMod7JfSQI7Aayw,"So first thing I was pleasantly surprised with is how nice, neat, clean, and chique this place is. Yes. For an Indian restaurant that is not always a given. Even the bathroom is clean haha

The interior decor is trendy with a big mural depicting Mumbai with marathi (language spoken is maharashtra where Mumbai is located) inscription saying ikde tikde which I belive is slang for here and there. I'm probably wrong. I can read the letters but my marathi is crap. 

Menu is pretty eclectic with authentic looking and sounding foods along with amazing ice cream flavors. Decent price.",1

1v9TVINzMod7JfSQI7Aayw,"There aren't many Indian options Dowtown, and this is the best for lunch w/buffet. It was surprisingly good and lived up to the other reviews. I assumed it would be an Americanized college fare based on the proximity to CSU, but the food is authentic and Deeelish ;)",1

The chicken tikka masala was great too. There was a lot of variety in the buffet. There was Gulaab Jamun for desserts, Palak paneee, veg kadhai, butter naan and few other things.",1
1v9TVINzMod7JfSQI7Aayw,"The art of creating and serving Indian street food is as comparable to the delicate ratio of ingredients that go into pani puri water. Any Indian will tell you that it's generally the secret ingredient of sweat that makes authentic Indian street treats so delectable (as nasty as that sounds!)

So will you taste the sweat at Bombay Chaat? It's unlikely. But there's hope for some hard work here. You'll find that it's nestled in a great part of the CSU campus. I'm not a local but it was easy to get here and fairly easy to find. It looks like they're working on signage, but they've got a great location. The insides, from what you can see in the other photos, are fairly modest and have the potential to have a cool vibe when there's more business.

On this afternoon, there was just a trickle of business with me being the first to step in. A menu on the wall greets you in foyer to see if you really want anything there. You order your food way in the back (as you pass the buffet if the time is right). Luckily they have a menu on their website with prices, so I definitely appreciated being able to peruse before going. 

OK GREAT... you ordered and the wait is minimal. There's no system really on how you get your food. I just sat and expected I would be served... perhaps I expected too much! But your food is given at the counter ÁE  la fast food. When I was alerted to get it by a kind employee, I was both excited and slightly dismayed by the sight. I ordered the pani puri and dahi puri (check out the pictures).

The pani for the pani puri was sloshing on the tray, which can be messy, I'd have preferred it was served in a more controlled way. The puri did not get soggy under the water which is good, but I found the filling to be lacking. It was opposite for the dahi puri, as there was a lot of yogurt, but equally less filling like in the pani puri. 

Let's do some math, because other reviews have already touched on portions. You get 8 pieces of pani puri and dahi puri per order, total of 16 pieces. At $5 per order, it comes out to be roughly $0.62 per puri. My inner Indian is screaming at the poor value of t",0

However, parking may be a pain if you are not a student or not living downtown. If you're lucky there is street parking!

The interior consists of bright greens/purples along with other colors that really catches ones attention. They have booths, table seating and high counter top areas. 

The food is ahhhhmazing. The food is very well seasoned, whether it's the rice or the chicken masala. I've heard from many people that this is one of the few places that do not hold back on the spices and therefore is a bit more authentic than other places. I am definitely one for spices, writing this review has my mouth watering already! 

The only setback for myself is that this place is a bit pricey, even the lunch buffet ($10/person from 11-3pm). However, you WILL get your money's worth in terms of quality and food. Although I may enjoy such a place, I am unable to frequent it often as it is out of my daily price range. Don't get me wrong, I will definitely return every once in awhile.",1
1v9TVINzMod7JfSQI7Aayw,"Wow! Incredible selection of authentic Indian food as well as a sprinkling of indo-chinese dishes. The staff was friendly, as we're the other patrons.

The garlic Naan in particular was amazing.",1

What I can tell you is that for $10, I left here with a very full and happy stomach and eager to return. I chose the buffet because I was a little overwhelmed to choose something from their expansive menu. I wasn't disappointed with the buffet, they seemed to have a decent selection for lunch: two different rice options, two different vegetarian options, two appetizer/snacking items and two chicken options. They also had fresh naan. The curries weren't mind blowingly flavorful, and to be honest I have had Indian curries I've liked better, but it was good, stick-to-your-bones food and you could fill your tray with whatever you liked best. The naan was better than I've had elsewhere- very substantial and chewy and soaked up the sauces well. Service was friendly and there is plenty of seating inside. 
If you need a quick lunch and you're really hungry, I think this is a fabulous option, and I love that we are getting more diverse options around the CSU campus other than hamburgers and pizza. Would definitely recommend to others to stop by if you haven't already!",1

They allow you to choose your level of ""spicy"". I have eaten Indian food all my life and I go for that medium spicy every single time. So for novices I highly recommend going for the mild spicy. 
No one goes here for the atmosphere, though is is cute in a kitschy sort of way. It's all self service but the people at the counter are very helpful and explain the menu pretty well.

They have the basics that most buffets have with naan, a few vegetarian side dishes, and chicken dish. The food was decent but definitely not as authentic Indian as I prefer. It is a little on the better end of Indian restaurants in Cleveland, and they have a diverse menu of both north and south Indian food, if that's what you're looking for.",0
1v9TVINzMod7JfSQI7Aayw,"So Bombaychaat serves authentic Indian cuisine. It's pretty much kinda like fast food. They have an extensive menu. However, it seems like it is only aimed at people who are familiar with Indian cuisine. The menu does not provide a description of what is in the food and the name of the food is not self explanatory. So if you do go here go with someone who is familiar with Indian cuisine. The staff also aren't the most friendly and are a little impatient. And like most other businesses in downtown Cleveland, it is a pain to find parking.

As for the food, what you actually pay for. I liked what I got. I got Dosi with masala on the side and it was a lot of food you definitely get your money's worth in terms of quantity as well as quality. I would definitely go here again despite my critiques from in the beginning of the review.",0

The sandwich comes with a large, deli-style pickle.  Score!  Add a Diet Coke and the total tab was $10.  Not bad.  My turkey melt was the largest sandwich I've seen in a long time.

1veVZUawy7IhIc5oDpRRQA,"Moe wants to know if you believe in Jesus. Do you? He hopes so.

""I'll see you in heaven,"" Moe, working the cash register, tells a customer. ""Hopefully I won't be running the deli up there.""

Everyone who heard him laughs, because Moe's already running the deli down here. Slyman's, in northeast Cleveland. Known for sandwiches -- specifically corned beef -- this place is all about God and good karma, too. It's not all in-your-face, but it's there. I find it refreshing.

In the bathroom, laminated verses from the Book of Matthew recount Jesus's sermon on the mount. Part of it reads:

""Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink.""

Fair advice. But I did come here for the food. For that corned beef sandwich. To see what the hype was about.

The only place to sit was the low counter that faces all the Three Stooges memorabilia, wedged between three customers to my right and boxes of delivery and/or to-go orders stacked on my left. Why The Three Stooges? Larry...Curly...Moe. Get it?

Prayer pamphlets are stacked in front of the cash register.

""Take as many as you want!"" Moe tells another customer as he works the machine. ""God bless.""

Moe doesn't look like he just came off of Mount Sinai. In fact, he looks like he spends more of his time in the kitchen than at the register. He's heavyset, balding, if not bald, and wearing casual clothes. He doesn't dress like a disciple. Nor does he dress like he owns the place. But preach, brother, because the corned beef sandwich on rye is delicious. Even better with a little mustard.

That must be why there's a line out the door. Why the only seat I could find was at the counter. Why it took a whole minute to worm my way to the bathroom between the other customers and the hardworking women who served them. So this is what blue-collar Ohio looks like. These are the humble folks just trying to make their way through the day.

I never liked Ohio much, even though I had never been outside the airport until this week, when I spent most of the time in the suburbs. But I had to make my way downtown, or at least in the city proper, and eat something authentic.

Slyman's is authentic.

""How's school goin'? Good?"" Moe asks a boy in his late teens or early 20s. ""I hope so.""

My check comes, and I go to pay at the register, just a few feet from where I ate. I go to pay Moe. He swipes my credit card and thanks me. I can't sign for a tip? No. No need to sign the receipt.

I open my wallet, spot a $5 bill and a $20. My meal was only about $8. I need some $1s so I can tip. I can tell Moe's too busy to break my $5, even though he probably would if I asked. Moe's working hard. So is everyone else. They don't deserve $1s for their tip. So I hand the $5 to Moe.

""Leave that on your table,"" he says. ""I didn't do nothing for ya.""

I smile at Modest Moe. I walk back to my spot to lay the $5 down.

""You're a good man,"" he says.

God bless.

1veVZUawy7IhIc5oDpRRQA,"Nora Ephron must have never made it to Cleveland.

Seems the debate between Katz's (NYC) and Langer's (LA) for best corned beef sandwich in America needs a third contestant.  Like its better known counterparts, Slymans seems a blast from the past, with yellowing formica-topped tabletops and cash-only tips for the waitstaff.

Ordered the corned beef melt (understanding that I lose Kosher authenticity points in the process) and received a softball-sized globe of shaved beef between two slices of overmatched soft rye.  Corned beef is warm, juicy, and incredible when eaten with a knife and fork.  Didn't have the courage to lift it to the face while wearing a shirt and tie.

Like Katz's, the focus is on the meat, with the bread merely serving as a delivery device.  Contrast this to Langer's, and the 2nd Avenue Deli (on 3rd Avenue, NYC), in which the focus is on the complete sandwich.  Unlike Katz's thick chunks and slices, Slyman's corned beef is sliced paper-thin and stacked, precluding more like-to-like comparisons of the corned beef itself.

Hot dog is excellent.  Fries come out of a bag.  Adequate street and lot parking available.",0
1veVZUawy7IhIc5oDpRRQA,"Hands down the best corned beef sandwich I've ever had. And I've had Izzy's in Cincinnati, and in nyc- Katz, Carnegie and stage. I've had Danny's in Columbus which is amazing so I was aware of slymans...same family. Slymans atmosphere and vibe were so authentic. And Sam's passion and hospitality make the whole experience. The sandwhich was huge. sliced perfectly, was so moist and so exceptional. And the potato pancakes were so good.  Don't bother with the 2 franchise locations go to the original on St Clair.",1
1veVZUawy7IhIc5oDpRRQA,As a transplanted New Yorker I can attest to the fact that this is authentic deli style Corned Beef and absolutely the best in town-better than Corky and Lenny's by far! The corned beef sandwiches and Ruben's are wonderful and big enough to share and the french fries are so tasty they are worth the calories.  If you go for lunch be prepared to wait online behind Cleveland's finest and dozens of area contractors--the people who always know a great place to get good food and large portions at a great price.,1
1veVZUawy7IhIc5oDpRRQA,"I have nothing to add to all the positive reviews. When in Cleveland I ALWAYS stop at Slyman's. The corned beef and pastrami are out of control. Grew up in NYC eating at authentic Jewish delis and what's presented here is as good, if not better. Service, as always, was friendly and pleasant.",1
228mfqUuGbnCs1kiupJXZw,"This is the best Thai restaurant in Cleveland. Spent time speaking with one of the owners. All the food served is authentic as it gets w/ recipes being used from her Grandma. Each time I have gone, I have gotten something different. I have never been disappointed.",1

228mfqUuGbnCs1kiupJXZw,"So delicious. I've been looking for good, authentic Thai cuisine since I moved to Cleveland. And indeed, I have! At last! I went with my sister when she came to visit me. We got the Drunken Noddles and substituted the chicken for duck, an extra $3.00 charge. But well worth it. It's situated in Cleveland's Asiatown, which isn't the best neighborhood. But the interiorr decor was pleasant and the food delicious. Reminded me of my favorite Thai place in Boston. And the service was quick, warm and friendly. An absolute pleasure!",1
228mfqUuGbnCs1kiupJXZw,"Map of Thailand is the new Mint Cafe.  

Mint Cafe used to be my favorite thai restaurant in the Cleveland metropolitan area.  I carried out from there basically every week.  It had pad thai that was very authentic (unlike Ty Fun), not mushy (unlike High Thai'd), had a good, full flavor (unlike Banana Blossom), yet was not overwhelmingly sweet (unlike Bangkok Thai).  It had duck that wasn't overwhelmed with ginger, and it also had a unique signature appetizer, the Golden Bags, composed of deep fried pouches containing delicious little morsels of meat.  Then, a year and a half ago, they abruptly closed.

Now a year and a half later, I walk into Map of Thailand and was surprised to find the same waitresses from Mint Cafe, the same owner, Vicki, and the same, wonderful food, as well as their signature Golden Bags.  I love Thai food and I've tried at least a Pad Thai at basically every Thai place you can name in the Cleveland area, and this ranks among the best.    It's definitely worth checking out.  I also recommend Peppermint in Pepper Pike (Mint Cafe's sister restaurant) and Charm Thai in Parma.",1
228mfqUuGbnCs1kiupJXZw,"This Thai food is more authentic than any other place in Cleveland. They have a pretty standard menu including the typical appetizers, fried noodles, chef specials, curries, and desserts. 

I went there and got the drunken noodles which had great flat rice noodles with a good selection of vegetables, shrimp and chicken. The portion size is very good, bigger than other other Thai places including the 'new' Mint cafe, Peppermint, and Lemongrass. It could have used slightly more sauce, but that might be a matter of preference. 

The wait staff were nice and courteous, the decoration was good. 

In summary:
The best tasting, most authentic Thai restaurant in Cleveland.",1
228mfqUuGbnCs1kiupJXZw,Delicious authentic dishes with a very friendly staff. The restaurant has a clean modern decor and a safe parking lot. I had the country Pad Thai - it had just the right item spice plus they added extra veggies since I'm a vegetarian.,1
228mfqUuGbnCs1kiupJXZw,"Got to say, walking into an empty restaurant draws red flags right away, but hey, since we were already there, might as well give it a try. Me and some co workers decided to go try some authentic Thai food, so after a ton of research we ended up here. Empty, so we got sat, and proceeded to get menus and order drinks. Its 10 F outside, so I wanted a soup, ordered the Tom Yung Kung (hot lemon grass soup), which was pretty good. The shrimp surprised me a little bit, but delicious nonetheless. Proceeded with our entrees, I got the Duck Panang Curry, which was delicious... best I've had yet. Spicy enough that your nose starts to run, but flavorful, which is difficult to find such combo. 

Overall, I am very pleased with this place, their service was great. I'll be sure to check it out next time I'm in town!",1
228mfqUuGbnCs1kiupJXZw,"Great service and pretty good thai food.  I still prefer peppermint thai in pepper pike but this is close by option.  They are near several other authentic asian restaurants and they have attached parking.  I got the seafood soup, basil chicken and panang curry. I was not that big a fan of the seafood coconut soup though people seem to rave about it.  The basil chicken and panang had good flavor profiles but I ordered level 3 on the heat scale and should have got level 2 even though I enjoy spicy food, if you don't like spicy food definitely ask for level 1 and you still may need plenty of water and rice.  Peppermint Thai has a slightly higher price point but a nicer ambiance but is in a completely different part of town.  I think Map of Thailand is a good option if you live nearby.  Portions are average size.  Chicken dishes are about 11$ and include rice and soup was 4$.  The coconut and green tea ice creams were pretty flavorful and a nice way to end the meal but Mitchell's is still my preferred ice cream provider.",1

I love Thai food, and have been to some fantastic restaurants serving authentic Thai dishes prepared by people from Thailand.  This was not one of those places.

I've had Thai food all over the country and I put this place on top! I will be back. Curry or duck or soup or apps - all good!!",1
228mfqUuGbnCs1kiupJXZw,"My SO lived in Bangkok, Thailand for 10 years. He still visits friends and family there once a year. I defer to him as the authority of Thai cuisine.

We went here for the 1st time. He considers Map of Thailand the closest to being authentic in CLE, pending future updates.

Here's what we had: (see my photos)

1. Golden bags: it looks like fried wonton, but wonton skin is made of flour. This is made of tofu skin. Tofu skin carries the mild fragrance of soy. Flavor of the filling is pretty close to spring roll. I can taste the shiitake mushroom. I think it's overall crispy and fragrant. My Thai authority didn't think much of it.

2. Thai lemon ice tea: Thai authority ordered. Usually other restaurants offer Thai ice (milk) tea. This is rare to find. I thought the black tea is very fragrant. Thai authority thinks it's a bit sweeter than authentic ones, but not bad.

3. Kao soi noodle soup: Thai authority ordered this, since it's rare to find in CLE. Strong curry flavor in the noodle soup with some crispy noodles on top, providing texture. Again, skewed sweet, but pretty good. I'd consider ordering this next time.

4. Masaman curry w/ seafood: shrimps were fresh, salmon so so. Overall Good flavor. I was comparing the curry to Peppermints's. I thought MOT's curry is lighter, more liquidy.

I then soon got corrected that in Thailand, the curry dishes should come out a bit soupy, unlike the American versions here tend to be dense and heavy. I think it's because the stereotypical impression is that curry should be like the Indian curry, which is often presented in a dense consistency. 

5. Lard nad: this is my benchmark dish when comparing restaurants. It's good, will order again. Again I thought Peppermint's has a stronger flavor. Truthfully I like the stronger version better. I think they use more shrimp paste to achieve the strong flavor.

But what do I know, I just attempt to cook Thai food with his cousins and listened to lectures about how the authentic versions should be. I didn't grow up eating from street vendors all over Bangkok.

6. Roti pancake: jackpot! I'm often amazed at how wonderful food come out of simple ingredients. I normally would bypass pancake on menu at any restaurant. But boy was I glad I had Thai authority to pick the real gem out of the bunch! 

They called it ""roti"" (when he was conversing with the staff to confirm the dish); I was actually thinking it could be roti saimai, another sugary unhealthy but amazing street dessert. 

The texture reminds me of roti canai (served at pacific east Coventry). Layers of sweet crispiness. To really think about the ingredients, it's only dough, fat, and condense milk. Most Thai vendors add their own twists, e.g. Banana, so MOT is the plain Jane version. But 24 hours later I'm still thinking about it. Fellow foodies, make sure to try it next time.

This is only the beginning. We will come back to evaluate other dishes",1

If you want a real treat, check out their wine dinners held in the private Florence Room next door!

2alo9GzeOsbg4jeKYFQmxQ,"Authentic Sicilian Italian-American restaurant. Everything was very good and the atmosphere is what I expected from an authentic Italian place. We got a pepperoni pie, white pizza, spaghetti and meatballs and the wonderfully prepared Broccolini. All the dishes were prepared deliciously and we couldn't have asked for a better meal. Why would anyone go to the big chains when this is easily accessible and we didn't have to wait to get a table. Our server, Jessica was perfect and was attentive to our table.

When we are up in Cleveland visiting we always make sure we go at least once but usually twice. My Local Cleveland family uses Santos all the time for catering and also the party center next store for family events. When we have room we take pizzas back to Florida for our kids.

2JeciNHrJE_tI-o2tUCu5w,"Found this little gem after moving here from Houston. Pretty much everything we ordered was made perfectly. The restaurant itself is small, but comfortable. I love how friendly the owner and the waiters are and how authentic their Thai food is. Next time if you are there for lunch on the weekdays, ask for their off menu specials, those won't disappoint you.",1
2JeciNHrJE_tI-o2tUCu5w,"I wanted to like this place.  Maybe I'm just picky when it comes to Thai food?  Maybe we just ordered the wrong things?

I've never been to Thailand, but the Thai food here is distinctly different from every other Thai place I've been to.  For instance, they don't have certain dishes that are practically staples at other Thai restaurants I've been to - pad see ew, duck in tamarind sauce, country style pad thai, etc.  So either this place is the only authentic Thai place in Cleveland, Boston, or LA, or it's just bad Americanized Thai food.  I suspect the latter.  

We had the Thai spring rolls for our appetizer.  They were in much need of the dipping sauce (read: bland), and the skin was very thick.  For her entree, my girlfriend ordered the Pad Thai.  The noodles were undercooked and tasted tough.  There was also a red spice in her dish that gave it an off-taste (no, it didn't make the dish spicy).  I ordered the crispy duck in sweet and sour sauce.  The sauce was so intense and sour that it overwhelmed the whole dish.  Plus, the duck was overcooked and... basically burnt to a crisp.  I could taste more crisp than actual duck.

The service was decent, except at one point during the meal, without so much as an excuse me, the waitress stuck her arm right in front of my girlfriend's face, mid-bite, reaching across the table to refill her water glass.  We both thought that was... kind of rude.

Sorry, Ty Fun, I don't think I'm going to be coming back.  For good, authentic Thai cuisine in the Cleveland area, I would suggest going to Peppermint Cafe in Pepper Pike.",0
2JeciNHrJE_tI-o2tUCu5w,"We visited Ty Fun, last night to have dinner with another couple before checking out the midnight shorts at the Cleveland Film Festival.  I was a bit worried about parking as we drove into the maze of streets in Treamont, but was very happy ro find a PARKING LOT right next door.  Upon entering, the small dining area looks small, but was very comfortable.  The tables were arranged well so that there was room to get around without difficulties.  The ceilings were also tall which made the space feel less claustrophobic.

On to the food - Bill, 1/2 of the couple we went to dinner with, suggested the restaurant and reported that he felt that it was pretty authentic, as he has traveled to Thailand many times on business.  Anyway, my bar was set pretty high.  We all decided to get two aps and four entrees to share amongst the table.    You will have to excuse if I don't remember the names of the different dishes - we tried the chicken on a stick with peanut sauce, which was fairly good.  The crispy spring roll like app was really good.  For entrees, we ordered the duck, green curry pork, pai tai, and a moderately spicy chicken with cashews.  The pai tai was decent and par for the course with most pai tai that I have tried before.  The chicken with cashews was pleasant - the cashews were very good and made the dish for me.  The green curry pork was very good and tasted very similar to the green curry that I have sampled over in Lakewood at Thai Hut...  The crowning dish to this meal was the duck - it alone made me give this place 4 stars instead of 3.  The duck was sooo crispy and the sauce was really good.  Another important factor of this meal was the veggies that were cooked and served with the meals.  They were very fresh tasting and matched well with the various sauces.  

One more thing - the staff of Ty Fun really did treat us very well.  They took time to speak with us and were very concerned about the quality of the food and about making us comfortable.

Overall - food - try the duck - service - very good - location - excellent.",1

2JeciNHrJE_tI-o2tUCu5w,"1st time at Ty Fun and everything about this place was excellent ! Would HIGHLY recommend a meal here ! I'm no expert on what authentic Thai food is supposed to be like but, everyone in our group loved their choice ! Well worth a visit !",1
2JeciNHrJE_tI-o2tUCu5w,Had plate #31 with Snapper. Whole fish arrived. Loved it!  Sweet and sour sauce was just as I recall it having spent much time in Thailand. My wife had the #60 Tofu dish with yellow curry sauce and it was authentic Thai. Great tiny place!!,1
2JeciNHrJE_tI-o2tUCu5w,"Really wonderful Thai food. Very fresh authentic Thai. Friendly staff, with a fantastic menu. I've always really enjoyed my meals here and have eaten and numerous top Thai restaurants in various states and many cities. This one is at the top of the list for me!",1
2JeciNHrJE_tI-o2tUCu5w,"OMG! I ordered takeout from Ty Fun Bistro via UberEats, and was BEYOND pleasantly surprised. 

To begin, this felt like super authentic Thai cuisine. The ingredients were all fresh, everything was spiced appropriately and the portion was generous. I ordered the Gang Keow Whan--Green curry cooked in coconut milk, eggplant, red bell pepper, string beans, zucchini & basil leaves.

This is not a drill: I think this was some of the best curry i've ever had in Cleveland.

The curry had an excellent, smooth texture that was milky and addictive. The vegetables were crisp. When mixed with the perfectly cooked jasmine rice, I could eat an entire meal alone with just the curry on rice. I can't wait to come visit this Bistro directly in the future. The menu is HUGE and the pages of options make it impossible to choose. Definitely check this place out!",1
2JeciNHrJE_tI-o2tUCu5w,Great Thai food!  The menu and preparation at Ty Fun rival (and maybe surpass?)  the authentic flavors of Thai restaurants I've enjoyed in NYC and Chicago.  This is one of Tremont's tiny gems.  Seems to do a brisk carry-out business but dining room service and atmosphere are right on the mark as well.,1
2JeciNHrJE_tI-o2tUCu5w,"Finally found great and authentic Thai food in Cleveland. I had the red curry dish with chicken and it was amazing! I would certainly recommend Ty Fun for fresh and authentic Thai food, can't wait to go back and try something else off the menu.",1
2JeciNHrJE_tI-o2tUCu5w,"Ugh. Disclaimer: We ate carryout here. 

Ty Fun is ok. It's not very flavorful though. Its not very authentic tasting - although it is probably a little more ""fusion"" than ""authentic"" that they're going after. I don't know... I'm just not a big fan. 

I thought it was expensive and kind of bland. I would much, much rather take my business to Banana Blossom.",0
2JeciNHrJE_tI-o2tUCu5w,"Used to frequent this place a couple of times a week. Their vegetarian menu was always pretty good. In the past couple of months they no longer advertise many of the vegetarian entrees, they've doubled their lunch prices, and they've cut portion sizes. In addition to that they've lost their authentic touches and for all of that I believe that there is better Thai food around Cleveland for an incredibly better price.",0
2JeciNHrJE_tI-o2tUCu5w,The only Thai restaurant that is authentic in Cleveland.  tad expensive but worth it,1
2JeciNHrJE_tI-o2tUCu5w,"We drove over one hour to find an authentic Thai restaurant. Well I'm glad to say we found a great one. Food is great and reasonably priced. Don't miss this gem in Cleveland Ohio, if you really want good Thai food and not the fake Asian places all Over Ohio that call themselves Thai.",1
2JeciNHrJE_tI-o2tUCu5w,"So I can't speak to how authentic the food is, but the tom kha (i usually get tofu) is addictively delicious.  I've only dined in there once but when I lived in downtown Cleveland I regularly got take out and it was never a disappointment.  The only thing I've had on the menu that I didn't love was the green curry - I thought it was a little bland; I'd prefer a curry with bolder flavors.
Even though the place has a small ""parking lot,"" its in shambles - it's nothing more than an empty lot that's been somewhat cleared.  They may have paved it since the last time I was there, but it used to have tons of deep potholes and get really muddy when the weather was wet.  If they haven't put down pavement yet, your best bet is to try to find some street parking.",0
2JeciNHrJE_tI-o2tUCu5w,"Two words: Generous portions.

Food tasted great and authentic. Thai food is great here and has the right amount  of kick to it. I ordered their soup Tom Kha Kai, which had some cocunut milk which helped offset the spice it had. It's good different and tasted great on the palate. For dinner, I had their Goong Ma Mung, which is jumbo shrimp with vegetables and cashew nuts. A generous portion, I brought the rest home. 

The space is small but it's a great place for a romantic dinner  or bringing a group of friends. Very warm and inviting. I recommend this place for anyone who frequents to Tremont and prices are reasonable.",1

2nn6Sx5EFpzFbsy5cJYHUg,"Overall this is a really good restaurant and location, but appears to still be working out some kinks. 

Food/ menu/ bar - The menu is pretty simple but is more than sufficient for the setting on the river in the flats, and frankly anything more complex would likely exceed their current capabilities. We had a regular burger, a fiesta burger, a black bean (veggie) burger and the Lake Erie (walleye) tacos. Each of us really liked the quality of food (fresh vegetables, gourmet breads for the buns, everything cooked precisely as ordered). Chips as the side were homemade, fresh and crispy - not the best or most flavorful homemade chips you will find but a very solid effort. Two of our plates came out  missing a few of the appropriate toppings, but our waitress identified the issue before we did and promptly fixed it. Minor infraction, happens everywhere, and I attribute this more to the management / startup issues (see below) than the food quality. The bar was well stocked, had a decent (not great, but pretty respectable) selection of micro brews and draughts. Overall, the food was a solid four stars, maybe four and a half. Prices were reasonable and very fair for the food quality and restaurant location. Beer prices seemed a touch on the high side for the type of restaurant, but not significantly so. Whoever is running the kitchen (and to some extent the bar) understands this restaurant's identity and is executing the plan very nicely.

Venue/ location - If you're looking for a rustic, authentic Cleveland venue, with a nice view and close proximity to downtown, ohio city and tremont, this is it. The riverside patio with small boardwalk is awesome, and the general location is very convenient to the rest of the city.  I can't in good conscience give the location five stars (it sits a stone's throw from at least three strip clubs and is surrounded by heavy, partially abandoned,  industry). Given that it sits on a scenic bend in the river and all of the windows and the patio face the river rather than the badlands that lie behind it, the location is a solid four stars. But if you attempt to walk there from Ohio City, just be prepared to really immerse   yourself in a true flats experience. 

Management / service/ startup issues - 
The hostess was probably the worst part of our night at Merwin's Wharf. She was looking down at her phone as we walked up and until we prompted her while standing right in front of her. Not a good start. Without looking at anything (no list check, no glance around the restaurant), she informed us it would be a 1/2 hour to 45 minute wait. We did not mind grabbing a beer at the bar and taking in the sunset, so we opted to wait. When we got to the bar we quickly noticed that no one else appeared to be waiting for tables, and at least three prime tables were open on the patio and had already been cleaned by the bus staff. We inquired with the bar tender whether we could take one of the open tables. He seemed confused why we were still waiting but told us the hostess would have to make that call. The bar was nice enough that we decided to just order food there, and as we did our buzzer went off (about 10 minutes after we got there, not 30-45). The hostess sat us at an inside table, told us none of the patio tables were available. We the watched her walk outside to notice how many tables were still open, but she just shrugged off the error and did not offer us a patio table (those patio tables remained open for the next 30 mins or so). As we went to cash out our bar tab to transfer to our table, the manager swooped onto the bar tender's computer and decided he needed to do a bunch of things at that moment (several other stations were open), so we stood waiting for our tiny bar tab for another ten minutes while the manager finished up his tasks. After we wrapped up at the and bar finally got to our table, the confusion continued. We had two waitresses that night. The first seemed very new and lost, but pleasant. She was quickly replaced by another waitress who seemed to have a good amount of restaurant experience and was very helpful and efficient. No less than 6 plates were smashed on the floor during the hour we were there. This appeared to be the result of a poor plate stacking location choice - placing tall stacks of plates on an exposed shelf between the kitchen window and the busy pathway that connects the bar, kitchen and server stations. I get that accidents happen and the plate smashing did not bother us much. But this seems like something a restaurant manager would only need to see once before relocating the plate stacks. Overall it appeared that the restaurant manager & hostess situations were generating the biggest issues we had with this restaurant. This category gets a one star, but could be improved very easily and quickly.",0
2nn6Sx5EFpzFbsy5cJYHUg,"I have been to Merwin's Wharf many times. I have to say mostly because of the location and not the food or service. I love sitting outside watching the boats go by. The food is always decent but nothing to rave about. The service is always friendly but slow. 

However, the reason for the 5 star rating is because today I brought my kids and grandkids for the Santa Brunch. We have been to several over the the past few years and this, by far, exceeds them all. My expectations of these events are not very high, but Merwins did it right. 

The food was great, cheese blintzes and cheesy grits were delicious. Food was hot and even the scrambled eggs were hot and not rubbery as at most buffets. They knocked it out of the park. I liked the relaxed atmosphere and authentic Santa. Spoiler alert:  I think he may have been the real one right from the North Pole. 

Add in the balloon toys, face painting and magic show and you have the makings of a magical Santa Brunch. 

Great job Merwin's!",1
2RmL-l7oQQOKNshFMoKl4w,"If Park-to-Shop offers better prices, this authentic Asian grocery offers better selection.

Housed in the renovated Asian town center, this under-the-radar Chinese grocery store is generally less busy than its counterpart several blocks away, Park-to-Shop. As mentioned above, prices are overall a tad more expensive, but occasionally you find a cheaper deal here. The selection in almost every department (vegetables, meats, seafood, snacks, noodles, Asian marinating/noodle/cooking sauces, etc) is larger than P2S and quality also seems a little better. Need pork mini spareribs for steamed black bean pork? Looking for bamboo leaves to make zongzi (Chinese wrapped rice dumplings)? Longing for douhua (sweet tofu pudding)? This is the place to get them! The only thing I couldn't find here was mugicha (Japanese barley tea) mix, for which I had to go to an even more specialized, and more expensive, Asian grocery store that was farther away.

My usual shopping pattern is to hit P2S first, then come here for what I couldn't find there. If you know what specific Asian ingredients/foods you are looking for, this is the place to go.

They also throw in free snacks/bakery goods at the checkout counter sometimes, which is a nice touch. Definitely recommended!",1
2RmL-l7oQQOKNshFMoKl4w,"I'll split this review in two aspects, the eatery and the grocery. The authentic eatery will be the main reason bringing me back in the future.

---The eatery---
in the back of the store, along side the storage area. True hole in the wall. The only menu available is on the cashier counter. The dishes are customizable. They automatically charge 15% service fee, which is fine by me. Saves me the hassle to write another line of tips on the check.

For all of you milk tea fanatics - your search for home made milk tea can stop here.

- milk tea: it's NOT on the menu. When we ordered ""milk tea"", the Cantonese mama reminded us ""it's Hong Kong style huh"". It took her 5 min to make it. I saw she opened a condensed milk can. There was a tea pot on her work station. The tea itself is not overly sweet. Upon finishing the tea, I can see very fine leaves at the bottom of the glass. So I diagnosed this milk tea to be NOT made from powder.

- Hong Kong Roast pork: aka crispy roast pork belly: top layer is crispy and crunchy, middle and bottom layer are fatty and juicy. A tad salty for me. Will order again.

- Hong Kong BBQ pork: aka Char siu: taste fresh, not overnight leftover. Seasoned just right. Will order again.

On the menu they are two separate dishes. In my photo it's one dish. You can ask the Cantonese mama to combine two dishes. Just add one dollar.

All rice dishes come with sweetly pickled carrots and daikon radish. This is the spirit of Cantonese char siu dishes! The pickles are refreshing companions to balance against the fatty animal protein.

- roast duck: crispy skin, sweet, fatty and juicy. Will order again.

- three treasure rice: not what I imagined - I thought it's going to be a combo of the duck, char situ, and roast pork. Instead it's grilled pork chop and fried egg. Not bad, nothing special. Won't order next time, because when you come to a Cantonese place, you order their specialty! I can get pork chop anywhere.

- chicken summer roll: nothing special compared to other Vietnamese and Thai  joints. Like I said, when in Hong Kong diners, order Cantonese specialties!

---The grocery shopping---

- selection: seem to offer more brands per genre than Cam Asia and park to shop

- organic products not an emphasis: cam Asia exceeds in this department 

- live seafood, butcher area: when you walk by, there is no strong door, which means it's probably fresh. My mom nodded her approval. 

- specialty seeds: next to the bags of rice, there is a small shelf of ""Asian vegetable seeds"", $1 /packet. They are hard to find Asian veggies I don't see available at Petiti's. Silk melon, Chinese chives, etc. 
There was no dates, so who know how long they have been on the aisle. I bought 2 packets and planted in my garden. We'll see how they come out.

- very limited I-Mei ç¾©ç¾E products: the food safety regulation is a known public concern in the Chinese market. (Recall the poisonous baby formula incident) I-mei is said to be the only brand that's trust-worthy. Again Cam Asia has a lot more selection. Please share with me if you what other brands are ok.

---conclusion---
So this authentic Cantonese eatery is officially on my map. To get HK style grilled dishes, I'd only come here or Li Wah. Here is inexpensive, $7 per dish, and I can mix and match different meat types. As a bonus I can do light Asian grocery shopping here.",0
2RmL-l7oQQOKNshFMoKl4w,"I would say the best overall asian grocery store in Cleveland is here.  The facility is large, clean, and have many products I couldn't even imagine.  The staff here is always helpful and friendly so don't hesitate to ask someone if you can't find something or have any questions.  The cooked food section is amazing!  Real, authentic, and delicious asian eats such as roast pork, sesame balls, yau-tiu (fried cruellers), soy milk, and my FAVORITE, their duck!  They have an amazing selection of korean and filipino foods, but a bit short on the chinese products.  Fish dept is a bit smaller than the other places, though they do have the essentials.  Not the busiest market in the area, but definitely the most fun, and happiest atmosphere.  I go to other markets once in awhile and though more people, the staff and customers seem to be drudging their time.  Here, the staff are casually socializing with anyone that has questions and having a good time.  

Although everyone has their own experiences and are free to have their own opinion about places, I find some of the 1-star reviews are a bit mis-directed.  Two people had issues with products (snack and fruit) which no-one could tell had any issues until actually opening it up.  Box is unexpired, or the fruit looks fresh on the outside, how can anyone short of x-ray vision know that the item was bad.  Seems like a supplier issue, not their fault.  Probably should've brought it to their attention and see how they would've handled it.  Though I can say they may have some items past their time but they haven't failed to address them when brought to their attention in my experiences.  

Anyways I digress.  The store always changes a little bit after a few months so I don't know if they're trying new layouts or if they do it to keep people on their toes lol.  Either way I always seem to have to ask where things are when they're moved but they're more than helpful.  They have a small cafeteria/ restaurant in the back which has some decent Pho, though their spicy soup (bun bo hue) is the one to go for.  In short, this place has all the essentials you'll need, great friendly staff, clean big store, some products are lacking, but their hot prepared food is the best bar none!  ...Did i forget to mention they have fidget spinners? Ha!",1
2RmL-l7oQQOKNshFMoKl4w,"Super cool Asian market in Asiatown. My friend and I stopped here while on the Asiatown Food Tour. I'm so happy we did, because otherwise I may not have come here on my own.

Admittedly, I am not a regular shopper of international markets, but my friend and I both agreed we need to come back and cook up delicious pho at home. Asia Food Company is a huge, sprawling market with international products, fresh produce and an authentic bakery in the back (and don't worry, lots of translations throughout the store). My friend, who is more well-versed in Asian eats, was super impressed with all the noodle and sweets options and all the fair prices.

It's just a cool place to explore, and the next time I'm back, you better believe I'll be leaving with several bags of loot to cook up a delicious noodle dish.",1
2tfMXjOotr1r168mVttUmQ,"I've been here a couple times and have had only good experiences. But this last time topped it off...EXCELLENT sandwich. I got the Very Vegan sandwich; because I love eggplant and have been hankering for some well-cooked eggplant lately. I've had 2 dishes from 2 different restaurants lately (Italian places that are supposed to be authentic but both places served spongy eggplant) and I've finally been able to satisfy my properly cooked eggplant craving at Local West. Description: a crusty, seemingly-homemade, large baguette stuffed with a big slab of eggplant. Eggplant was creamy on the inside, with skin still on and the skin was perfectly tender.  I always figure if you don't like eggplant, you don't  know how to cook it properly. Will this dude making my food must like eggplant. It was very flavorful with the onions, garlic and tomatoes. The description on the board also said ""cashews"" and I assume cashews were in the sauce to make a creamy factor because I did not detect cashews in the sandwich. In any event, you should go get one of these. I had the pickled, golden beet side dish. Good portion, even had leftovers of the beets and added to my salad for today's lunch. My husband had the corn chowder and a side of the bean salad. This place has really good food, fast and the girl who took my order was friendly. Good atmosphere in there. Check it out.",1
3_STYcEwVsieJPo0GWjxLw,Bomb food every time. Always hot when delivered. Bomb authentic American style Chinese food!,1
3_STYcEwVsieJPo0GWjxLw,"A local favorite for the West Siders, most definitely. This place have been around town for awhile now, I believe more than 20 years. The food is good if you're in the mood for some Chinese food. I went here after my boyfriend recommended this place because he used to go here when he was a kid with his family. The only place around that makes some tasty Pineapple Chicken and the portions are generous. The prices are reasonable and if you're looking to come to dine in, I wouldn't recommend it since this is merely just a take out place. Luckily, this place had some authentic dishes so it's convenient for those who don't want to take the drive downtown. Their Singapore style pan fried noodles was good and plentiful for just one person. If you know what's authentic, then you have no problem picking out the ones that are. 

We went there to order in person since we were coming back from our day of shopping so I'v never experienced their take out so I can't say if that is bad. If I'm in the area visiting the boyfriend's parents place, I'll try and see since it's not that far away.",1
37U2krgNsV4WYt1TuyyUGg,"Wow...this place is a hidden gem for sure.  The food is top notch and the most authentic Cajun cooking that I've had outside of the New Orleans area.  Everything is made in house and from scratch, so you have great fresh ingredients paired with the knowledge and know how to bring them together to represent NOLA here in the CLE.  The drinks are on point as well, the hurricanes are fantastic.  

With that being said, a tavern is nothing without atmosphere.  This was my first time here, and the bartenders, owner, hell...even the customers that were there made it a completely inviting place.  The lighting, the decor, and the live music, which is every Saturday by the way!!!

Last but not least.  This is a great place to go for a nice little date night, cozy, not overly loud, perfect for conversations and a just all around good time.",1
3bM9rmjbaLOrlS--dRzZAw,"3.5 stars. The soups are really good. The fajitas are excellent. They have a very good spicy sauce that you have to ask for. The corn chips appear to be home made as well as the flavorful salsa. The portions can be measured in enorms. The combination plates are ridiculous. I would say you can feed a family of 4 with 2 combo plates that are like 10$ a piece. Some of the food is authentic but not most. Too many dishes with ground beef. But the food seems to be very fresh. The drinks are really cheap, its hard not to get shi*-faced. Like 6 bucks for a pitcher of beer and specials. The service is very efficient and friendly. The place definitely has a Disney Mexican decor going.",1
3bM9rmjbaLOrlS--dRzZAw,"Pros: looks very authentic when you enter.  The tables look very cultural. I have never seen so much colorful furniture in a restaurant. The food is cheap, and it was good.  Very flavorable and the waiter was helpful. 
Cons: It looked like there was only two waiters to service the whole restaurant. 
Conclusion: It was a good eat here.  I was really surprised by the quality of the food, with such low prices",1
3bM9rmjbaLOrlS--dRzZAw,"I consider myself a Mexican restaurant guru. I love authentic Mexican food.  Three things I look for in a Mexican restaurant are chips & salsa, fast service, and good prices. El Rodeo hits all three. The salsa has a but of a kick which I love!  The chips were a bit bland but the salsa more than made up for it. Service was fast. I was in and out for lunch in 30 min. The prices were great. My lunch was under $10. They also have $5 specials. The food was good but not the best. It was the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.",1
3dMAswAQk0ehFvuE8V8RDA,"We've been meaning to check out Istanbul Grill in Tremont for a long time, and finally, thankfully did! From the tasty authentic Turkish cuisine, to the charming decor and friendly, accommodating service (thanks Andrew and Greta!), this will be a new regular spot for us.

The ambiance is cozy and inviting with lovely Turkish ornamentation throughout. A beautiful brick archway leads you to a raised up dining area, where all the tables feel very private and intimate. The patio out front would be the perfect people-watching place for dessert and a cup of coffee.

We started at the bar with a couple of appetizers and wine during happy hour. We had Hummus (rich and creamy - yum!) and Ezme (a fresh tomato dip) with the most amazing, warm and delicious grilled pita bread. The Sigara Boric were really good - delicately deep fried phyllo rolls with house-made feta cheese inside. We will probably order these on every visit!

For entrees, he had the Chef's Chicken Burger which had great flavor and was served with a yoghurt dill sauce. Next time he would order the burger on the pita bread, because it was so amazing. The deliciously crispy fries tasted like they were battered in a little chick pea flour, giving them extra flavor and crispness.

I had the Kuru Fasulye Pilav (white bean stew with rice), which was mild in flavor but nice, and healthy-tasting (in a good way!)There were tons of vegetarian and vegan options on the menu. It will take a while to work my way through it!

Note: If you check it out on the website, don't let that mislead you. It does not do the setting or intimacy justice, and the food imagery on it looks sort of cafeteria-like, when it is actually quite delicious.",1
3dMAswAQk0ehFvuE8V8RDA,"Really delicious and authentic. I recommend the dinner for two: mezze/salads, really delicious pide/bread, mixed grill with rice, and dessert. There was so much that we took at least half of the mixed grill home. It's also nice that there is a halal restaurant in Tremont. I'm excited to return and try some more dishes.",1

3e0IGa_-zqTemKLc1dbdmg,"So excited to find a good Taiwanese restaurant in Cleveland! I was in town visiting a friend and we had just come back from a long weekend at Cedar Point. Being from Houston and having frequented Taiwan several times, we were craving a soothing, hot bowl of beef noodle soup. We arrived around 815pm (closes at 9pm) and were seated right away. 

My friends got the beef noodle soup, and I got the pork and pickled radish noodle soup. Both were excellent - the broth was so flavorful. The broth was definitely on par with that in the noodle soups I've had in the Houston Chinatown. The only complaints I could think of were the noodles (I wish they were thicker and/or homemade) and the beef was a bit bland (but it was super tender). We also got some bubble tea - tea was yum but the actual tapioca was pretty overcooked.

If I lived in Cleveland, I'd frequent this place very often....great, authentic Taiwanese cafe with super nice owners and reasonable prices.",1
3e0IGa_-zqTemKLc1dbdmg,"Very good food. Pretty authentic taste, noodles and dumplings were made in house, fair portions. My parents approved, and they normally don't give a ish about anything.",1
3e0IGa_-zqTemKLc1dbdmg,"We went here with our family after a gymnastics meet for ""Chinese"" noodles.  The service was excellent and she recommended an assortment of plates served family style. The food and boba tea was delicious!! Highly recommend for authentic food in a casual environment. Happy we found the place, thanks to Yelp!",1
3e0IGa_-zqTemKLc1dbdmg,"Once upon a time, Cleveland had Taiwanese food... Not Thai food, Taiwanese.  There may have been others, but the one I remember was in the complex where Han's skewer shop is now.  You could get Taiwanese beef noodles and other things, but it wasn't always open, and ... obviously it's gone.

Fast forward, the team that used to run the Chinese shop near playhouse Square opened a new location in the same complex as Superior Pho.  

How did I find this out?  

Well, my brother and I were off to get some Pho, and we saw... PHUSION CAFE.  What on earth?

THere's nothing at all in the title that suggests what it might be fusing - but a glance at the menu indicated that there were a lot of Taiwanese dishes - which warranted a much closer look.

How close?

Well, two people ordered 4 entrees -

Hakka style dried bean curd
Taiwanese beef noodle
Taiwanese sausage fried rice
Braised bean curd. 

All were good, authentic, and, with exception of the braised bean curd, unavailable at other venues in Cleveland.  The bean curds were very fresh - and the braised version was very crispy on the surface, something that isn't always managed correctly.  Ideally, it should be moist within, with only the surface seared.  They know what they're doing.

I'm half Hakka, so getting the dried bean curd sauti was also quite a treat.

Fried rice and noodles are standard fare, but well executed.

So - how do you spread the word?

Get a party together... 

The next day, a party of 28 descended upon Phusion Cafe, and they served buffet style Taiwanese Beef Noodles, Beef Sauce Rice (This sounds nasty, but is actually divine.) Hakka styled pork belly (Divine)... actually let's do this dish by dish.

Beef Sauce +Rice
This is essentially mince-meat sauce that's got flavor to die for.  You put it on your carb of choice, and eat until your belly decides to either expand, or burst - either way, you keep eating.  For all of those with a weakness for carbs+meatsauce, try using Quinoa instead.  I love this combo.

Hakka Pork Belly - (MeiCaiKouRou/fbhfcho|
Another tremendous Hakka dish seasoned with Chinese Mustards and soy sauce that is stewed until the flavors permeate deeply, leaving the gastronomist oh-so-much to taste and savor.

Had fish cakes, beef noodles and a number of other dishes on the",1
3e0IGa_-zqTemKLc1dbdmg,"I am so happy that authentic Chinese food is obtainable within walking distance now. I've been here twice, got the braised pork with rice and stew pork belly with rice. Both dishes were good, although I could use for more meat and less rice. They give a ridiculously large amount of rice. Also, this place is small but both times I was able to find a table. People also don't tend to stay long so you probably wouldn't have to wait long for a table.",1
3e0IGa_-zqTemKLc1dbdmg,Definitely the most authentic Taiwanese food in the region!!! The taste was just the same as my Taiwanese friend made! Will come again when I am back to Cleveland.,1

Pro:  the flavors are authentic.  
Cons:  The food took FOREVER even though there were barely any customers.  Our order took half an hour.  We ordered 2 soup noodle dishes; one was a bit bland, and the other was yummy.  Both didn't have anything in them aside from noodles and a 2 very small pieces of meat.  While I think the food is way overpriced for what little you get, if you have a craving for authentic taiwanese food, this could be a place for you!",0

The scallion pancakes and pot stickers and three cup chicken were also delicious.

Very pleasant and helpful service as well. 

Highly recommended!",1
3e0IGa_-zqTemKLc1dbdmg,"Came to Cleveland to work for a week, found this place on yelp and it surprised me ! The owner is super nice, the drink and pork chop rice is superb. I'm from Taiwan, and I can tell you this place is authentic ! Will be back for sure.",1
3e0IGa_-zqTemKLc1dbdmg,"I've been holding off writing a review for this place for quite a while now. About a year actually, although it wasn't because I hadn't tried it. In fact, I've visited this restaurant several times in the past year, but I could never give it the review I truly wanted to. 

First off, let me just say that I have such admiration for the owner of this restaurant. Did you know that he owns not just one, but three restaurants in Cleveland? Each with a different menu and concept? Yet every time I stop in Phusion, there he is at the front, greeting people, cashing them out, asking how their food was, humble as can be. This guy is pure immigrant work ethic and it just fills my heart with happiness for his business success thus far.

That being said, the first few times... okay the first several times I came in here, the service (aside from that via the owner) was just poor. It wasn't bad in the sense that the servers were rude or impatient, they were just poor servers. They were awkward, they acted like they had never worked in a restaurant before, and they didn't sell the product to me. This is what made it hard for me to, as I said, give this place the review I wanted to. There was always just something a little off about it.... until now. The last two times I've stopped in, there has been the sweetest, kindest, friendliest girl working there (I'm sorry I wish I knew her name!). She is very knowledgeable about the menu, and was able to offer suggestions to my friend who had never been. She is engaging without hovering, and goes above and beyond to give great customer service. This is what I've been waiting for all along! Now onto the food....

The food is true Taiwanese delight. I haven't tried a ton of dishes on their menu, but those I have tried have been not what I expected at all, and this is a great thing. You see, oftentimes I have an expectation going into Chinese restaurants that they will offer something only vaguely Chinese, modified for American palettes, and I leave feeling oh so dismayed. This place however, is authentic Hakka cuisine. Each dish I've had reminds me of a street food stand, and not in a bad way, but in the sense that it tastes so homemade, so pure to the intent, that you have no doubt as to what they intended the dish to be. Take for example the potstickers. Now, normally you order potstickers, and you get these measly little pockets with filling that has no resemblance to anything you could identify. The potstickers here however, are giant doughy pillows filled with juicy meat that leaves you to discern whether you should keep chowing down or wait for the giant clouds of steam to escape (personally, I'm never that patient). I also want to give a shoutout to the beef noodle soup... it's rich, it's full of tender chunks of beef, and to top it off they offer hand pulled noodles leaving you so satisfied and full. Finally, you can't leave here without getting some of their bubble tea! It's pretty sweet, but they use Ten Ren tea, not powder, so you get a lot of flavor and the fruit ones are so refreshing on a hot day. 

Phew. I feel better now I was able to properly review this place. Now just fingers crossed they can keep up the good service!",1
3e0IGa_-zqTemKLc1dbdmg,"I'm going to give this place a four because I feel as though the quality and taste of the food was very authentic. So much in fact that it tastes like my moms cooking, and she lived in southern Taiwan until she was about 25 years old. Dishes tried: Beef Noodle Soup. Braised Pork Belly with Preserved Veggies. (""What she order?"") Fish Fillet. Black Milk Bubble Tea. 

However, keep in mind that I've been in Taiwan and have eaten the most drool-worthy, dream-inducing, taste bud-exploding dishes. This place does not compare to the real deal. It is more of a home cooked taste. Now, that's a good thing because it means it is made with love and care. However, in my life it is also a bad thing because I can literally stay at home and eat the same food. I likely won't be making a trek to Cleveland solely to eat here. If I'm in the area though, I'd keep it in mind. Especially since the manager/owner gentleman was extremely friendly, and the servers were very kind.


p.s. The tea was good, but the bubbles need a little extra OOMPH in my opinion.",1
3e0IGa_-zqTemKLc1dbdmg,Finally an authentic Taiwanese restaurant in town!!! We walked in the restaurant at around 8:50 pm and they still let us in which is awesome 'cause we were STARVING.

3e0IGa_-zqTemKLc1dbdmg,"Finally, a Taiwanese place in Cleveland! Giving it four stars instead of five only because the service was on the slow side and I think some of the dishes did trend towards the salty side. I bought the lu rou fan (pork belly with rice), which I really don't think you can find anywhere else in the city. It tasted authentic and was well-priced. My friend ordered the spicy fish filet, which was definitely quite salty. The bamboo with garlic sauce was surprisingly tasty, as the bamboo was sautÁE©ed well (and believe me, I usually hate bamboo) and the sauce was very flavorful. Even if you don't like bamboo, I might consider this dish.

Overall, while the food trended towards salty, this is a pretty authentic Taiwanese food experience that I highly recommend.",1
3e0IGa_-zqTemKLc1dbdmg,"I came to Cleveland for an interview from Houston (second largest chinatown in US), so I was not expecting much in terms of Asian food scene. However, as soon as I found a Taiwanese place, I knew I gotta check it out. Upon entering, I could tell the shop owner was Taiwanese from his accent, and we hit it off real well from the start. He was very friendly with customers, and he even joked that if I don't have money to pay cuz i'm a poor student, I can do the dishes. 

Onto the food. I got the braised chicken thigh rice. It was pretty standard taiwanese set meals with some ground pork sauce over rice, veggies on the side (asparagus in this case), and a braised egg. Good portion size in meat and rice, and owner offered me more rice if I needed it. It may not be the best thing in the world, but it tasted homemade to me like how my mother would make it, so I was very surprised. The milk tea tasted very much like ones I would get for breakfast in Taipei on the streets. The curry beef pancake was very flavorful, and I loved the sauce. Overall, 5 stars for service and the home-made feel. It definitely was not 100% authentic or the best taiwanese food I've ever had, but it was comforting and got my Asian food fix. Will definitely come back if I return to the city!",1
3e0IGa_-zqTemKLc1dbdmg,"Why hello again, yelp.  I figured it was about time that I reviewed this place.  I was told that this was an offshoot of China Sea by CSU - run by some of the same people.  

OVERALL: 
I've been here a couple of times already.  First of all I am very, very happy that a Taiwanese cafe has come to Cleveland!  This place is not the best, but for Cleveland it's pretty good!  Try the braised pork over rice and the beef noodle soup.  The simplified Chinese does throw me off a bit.  They do not use simplified Chinese characters in Taiwan. 

SPECIFIC DISHES (best to worst):
- Braised pork with rice (rou zhao fan) - It's pretty simple - minced pork meat poured over rice as a sauce.  It's pretty authentic, but I did wish the proportion of meat to rice was greater.
- Salt and pepper fish (jiao yan yu pian) - Chunks of fried fish with salt and pepper, this was flavored perfectly! 
- Beef noodle soup (niu rou mian) - Somewhat spicy, but not overwhelming.  Beef and noodles were both on the spot.
- Pork chop over rice (zhu pa fan) - Expected the pork chop to be fried, and for the rice to have some minced pork sauce as well, so this dish felt kind of bare.  Flavored fine though.
- Taiwan peddler noodle (tai nan dan zi mian) - It was not bad, but I'm used to this dish having a tea egg, and also this one had too much vinegar and not much soup.
- They also have the Ten Ren bubble tea (I haven't tried it, but I'm guessing it's probably similar to that at China Sea).  And yes, there is a rumor that they will start serving breakfast.  We'll see if I upgrade my review a bit in the future!

SERVICE:
It's okay.  They seem a little new at this; they would bring the food without utensils; and once they forgot to bring one of our two dishes and it took them a couple of minutes with us staring at them for them to realize.",0

3e0IGa_-zqTemKLc1dbdmg,"I was alerted to this place by Taiwanese friend, it opened about 2 weeks ago so I can imagine any slight missteps can be attributed to them still getting their footing. It's located in a weird open area in the same building as Superior Pho. I think the owner may also own China Sea Express (?) (which I was not a huge fan of, the èEEçE¥é£¯ they serve there was like çE¸éE¬instead, and a fried egg instead of a tea egg wtf) 

I'm Taiwanese but I'm not Hakka, so this time I just ordered the stuff I thought I'd be able to judge better, the beef noodle soup ï¼EåE°çE£çEEèEEéE¢ï¼E, the Tainan ""e (åE°åEEæEEä»EéE¢) , the pork with preserved vegetables (æ¢EèEEæE£èEE), and the bubble tea. 

Beef noodle soup - holy crap it basically tastes just like my mom makes. Big portion, really tender beef, crispy bok choi, noodles have good texture, if you have a craving for this Phusion Cafe is the place to hit up. Looking at the pictures though, it looks like we didn't get any green onions while other people did? not a huge deal, I don't think I usually eat mine with green onions anyway

Peddler noodle - I could not for the life of me figure out why this tasted really bland to me, I've had peddler noodle in Tainan a number of years ago so I chalked it up to me just forgetting what it tasted like. But I went home and looked at my recipe book and looked at a picture someone else uploaded on Yelp...realized that they didn't give us any ground pork with our noodles! Kinda"" it was actually missing a key ingredient...

Pork w/ preserved vegetables - very very flavorful, good amount of pork. I think the pork belly could have been a little more tender, only criticism. 

Milk tea - flavor was pretty good (we got 1/2 sugar and 1/2 ice, you can tweak it like that if you want), I thought there were too few bubbles though and they were too soft and a little on the bland side, not sweet enough. It's $4.50 for a large + bubbles, kind of on the expensive side for not a gigantic cup 

Price - besides milk tea, this stuff is surprisingly cheap. The beef noodle soup is a huge bowl and only $7.95. 

Service - had to ask for rice with our pork, and our water didn't get refilled. Otherwise was fine, they're very friendly and I chatted with the boss for a bit. 

Moving forward - the boss is thinking of expanding to some Taiwanese breakfast options as well as some Taiwanese street food (which should definitely be the case cause I think the Chinese name of this place is literally ""Taiwan Small Eats"") and asked me for some suggestions, I told him çEEé¤Eæ²¹æ¢Eï¼EåE¸è±Eæ¼¿ ï¼Eãé£¯ç³°ï¼EèE­è±EèEEã(yeah that's right, everyone should try stinky tofu!), å¤§èE¸åEEå°EèE¸ï¼Eand good old oyster pancake. 

I'm not sure how feasible some of this stuff is, apparently oyster quality around here is pretty bad, bu",0
3e0IGa_-zqTemKLc1dbdmg,"I'm so glad this area has been converted into a new place to eat! Before it used to be a shady bar, and an area to avoid. Now the aromas cannot keep us away! Good authentic Taiwanese food with friendly service, what more can you ask for when you have these essentials. Since it was a cold day, most of us ordered the traditional beef noodle soup. The beef was very tender, which I was super happy about. The flavor of the soup base was also quite good, and not diluted down. Sadly, I've noticed other restaurants that do this to save money, lets hope they keep this dish the way it is right now- no changes need to be made! Some friends also ordered the eggplant and pork over rice dishes. Everyone seemed happy happy happy, so the food was prepared well! I of course also had to have their  boba, and was very happy with their milk tea. I think it might be my new stop whenever I'm craving for boba; hopefully they have custard etc for the drinks in the near future! For my first visit I was quite happy with the food, service, and prices. I must return to try all their Hakka dishes, being Hakka Chinese myself! The portions are quite filling for me, which is why I could not order more to try during this first visit. Great new place for CLE!",1
3e0IGa_-zqTemKLc1dbdmg,"Phusion is a tiny restaurant but does delivery and take-outs, too. This place features plenty of authentic Taiwanese food and regional tastes. Although there's not much you can explore around this place, it is a good place for a more relaxed lunch. To my surprise, this place has very good service compared to many other Asian restaurants. But even though it's a cafe, their bubble milk teas are not that good.",1

Noodle is chewy and the soup base flavorful with hint of tomato and savor of beef stew. The pickled vegetables garnished on top makes the noodle even more chewy! The baby Bokchoy is soaked with soup base as well!!

The basil Eggplant dish is also very good! Has many vegetables and instead of being greasy and sweet, the basil and onions make it really refreshing!!",1
3e0IGa_-zqTemKLc1dbdmg,"I've been waiting for too long for a restaurant in Cleveland that serves authentic Taiwanese food and I am so glad this place open up. I tried their three cup chicken, beef noodle soup, soy paste noodles, and a stir fry dish. Everything was satisfactory and the portions are good. Maybe I am used to super authentic Taiwanese food, somehow I feel there could be more flavor to the three cup chicken and the beef noodle soup. Other than that the food really is quite Taiwanese and I'd definitely go back many more times! Good price as well. 

Con: Make sure you are very clear when you order food, the waitress got our food wrong couple times and forgot to put down what we ordered the 2 times I went.",1
3e0IGa_-zqTemKLc1dbdmg,"Small and cozy spot. I ordered the beef noodle soup, which was delicious and comforting. My food was served hot and reminded me of a home-cooked meal. (Ask for their house chili oil, it makes it even better.)

The owner was incredibly kind and thoughtful. He checked in often and even refilled my thermos with tea on my way out because it was a cold day.",1
3e0IGa_-zqTemKLc1dbdmg,"I was really impressed with this place.  Amazing place to get not-overly-greasy versions of your favorite Americanized Chinese foods, plus great interpretations of more authentic Taiwanese takeout items.  

I had the popcorn chicken, fried potstickers and the General Tso's chicken.  TIP: ask for the General Tso's ""really crispy"" or extra crispy...it comes out with the texture of the popcorn chicken, and then you can add extra sauce as you choose.   This is how I avoided getting whole bites of nothing but gross bread/fat, as often happens at other places.   AND, since you're bound to have leftovers, this texture is more conducive to reheating...I'm currently eating some General Tso's the day after buying it, and it didn't get gross in the microwave at all.  WOO.",1
3e0IGa_-zqTemKLc1dbdmg,"Phusion Cafe is a fairly new restaurant inside the 3030 Superior Ave. building that houses several different businesses. 

This is no frills, cozy dining room shop serving tasty food with friendly staff. I tried their Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup and it was delicious and quite authentic. The broth was rich and the beef was tender and savory. The noodles appears home-made but I couldn't be sure. The bowl also had some greens which accompanied the noodle and broth well.

I had the Pork Chop over rice to-go and found it a little disappointing. The pork chop was tender but the seasoning was unbalanced. They served it with half a hard boiled egg and some pickled vegetables. I think I was expecting something similar to a Vietnamese Pork Chop and rice, which it clearly wasn't. 

Overall, I will definitely return for another meal because there are other dishes that I'd love to try there.",1

3r_y_cjRlobJNApmXDJoRg,"Simple, delicious, affordable. The owner, I think, was our server, and he recommended meals according to our preferences.

3r_y_cjRlobJNApmXDJoRg,"Phnom Penh, maybe it was the glowing reviews from other Yelpers or my partner's extremely enthusiastic recommendation, but I expected more from you. 

First of all, we came here on a Saturday afternoon and the place was EMPTY. There were tumbleweeds. It was apparently empty enough that the management only felt that the (already dim) lights had to be on for only 1/3 of the dining room. We squinted to read the menu and squinted some more to see each other and our food. The server was quiet and disinterested, which I understand; seeing as how there were only maybe 3 other occupied tables. Before we even had a bite of food, it was shaping up to be a not-so-good experience. 

I love that they allow you to pick how spicy you want your meal! My partner comes here on her lunch break occasionally and gets pad thai with medium spiciness, so I felt safe ordering that. It came out bright red, and she said that she'd never seen it that colour before. I don't know if they were having an off day or the waiter took our order wrong, but it was definitely NOT medium spiciness. We only got through maybe a quarter of the pad thai before boxing it up. Which I enthusiastically gobbled up the next morning for breakfast, while my taste buds were still a little singed and sleepy. Despite the spiciness, the pad thai was excellent and very authentic.

Anyways, the food really was almost really good, but I left feeling very underwhelmed. If I ever do return, it'll be for takeout.",0
3r_y_cjRlobJNApmXDJoRg,"Eh.... I'm kinda disappointed with the food. My expectations were high, coming from authentic Khmer cooking myself. I ordered the Salaw Machu Kreoung ""Fantasy Stew"" and Chicken Chaa Kreoung (every Khmer person has had their fair share of both dishes and can name the exact person who makes the best of those dishes) but what I ordered here lacked authenticity. I feel like the restaurant catered more to the 'American' tastebud than trying to showcase REAL KHMER FLAVORS. The stew should NOT be as sweet as it is, it should be more pungent and tangy. The chaa kreoung was also sweeter than what I've had. It lacked the ""kreoung"" flavor that I anticipated. The ""Kreoung"" is a paste that is used in a lot of dishes composed of lemongrass, turmeric, galanga, garlic, shallots etc. But overall... eh, from what I'm used to from my family's cooking. People's reviews on here made the food seem BOMB and it was really just okay.",0

3r_y_cjRlobJNApmXDJoRg,"Great authentic food. The biggest issue is poor service. Went for dinner last night two of the waiters sat in the corner eating and on there laptops.This has always been an issue, which could explain the vacant dining room most of the time. if the staff is not on their Ipads  or laptops they are attending to their children  who have a playroom set up in the restaurant. Going forward it will only be take out in this dark gloomy restaurant.",0
3r_y_cjRlobJNApmXDJoRg,"For our first night on project in this city, our team came here looking for some authentic Malaysian food. Spurred by numerous Yelp reviews on specific dishes, we tried them all out.

PROS:
+ Na ting: I'm still thinking of the sound that coconut milk and spicy sauce made when it sizzled onto the pieces of rice cracker. If you don't get this as an appetizer to share, shame on you.
+ Fried tofu: interesting choice of tofu for making this app, sauce accompanying it was spot on.
+ Pad thai: although it didn't look appealing (it was bright pink) the taste and texture made up for my initial reservations.

CONS:
- Chha Kreoung Ma Rass Prowt: not as great as I thought it would be. For one thing, we asked for it to be very spicy and it turned out to not be so hot at all. Another thing was what little meat there was was hidden by the green peppers and other vegetables
- Thai tea: worst thai tea I have ever had -- watered down tea taste and wayyy too much sugar. How unfortunate :[

Come here for a quick and casual dinner with friends and share the appetizers. The entrees are solid for the most part, but as always, try new things not necessarily vetted by the Yelp reviews!",0
3r_y_cjRlobJNApmXDJoRg,"One star due to the fact the fish cakes were good. Everything else was just garbage.  
The spicy soup. Just noodles and oil with a little bit of beef. This place sucks.

Got the 13 dollar dish that has only meat and seafood. It was like an appetizer portion. If I wasn't with my friend who owns a restaurant I would have sent it back.  Just a plain rip off.
 

The spring roll was just garbage. I asked for meat or shrimp, and they said no problem. Not, epic fail.  I know what tastes good.There are a bunch of  hipsters who say this place is great, I think they are  smoking crack. This place is owned by a bunch of cheap people who want to load you up on the cheap starches.   Do not order any dish above 7 dollars or you will just get screwed. These people are so cheap. I am embarrassed I brought my fiend who owns a successful Asian  restaurant here. 

I have eaten a lot of ethic food do to the 7 yrs I spent in the business.  I got 2 free authentic meals a day.  Korean, Thai, Japanese, Chinese, from 18 to 27 years of age with stints of living in Mexico. I know my shit and can cook too.  This place garbage for serious foodies.

The food here as always been average, my 50 dollar bill for 2 people represented culinary garbage.

I hate to dis a mom and pop place but this was just bad food, no protein, and just a crappy experience and left with 50$ less in my pocket for one sub par lunch.  Bah humbug!",0
3r_y_cjRlobJNApmXDJoRg,"I absolutely ADORE this place. Its a family owned restaurant and you feel like they are serving authentic food out of their own kitchen. I love looking at the beautiful giant carved wooden panels on the walls. The owners are so friendly and offer great food suggestions. Since I'm not really familiar with Cambodian food, I always ask for their recommendations and they have never steered me wrong. 

I typically get the Chha Kreoung Ma Rass Prowt with tofu and vegetables. It has a rich peanut sauce and fresh vegetables that I devour in its entirety every time. 
For dessert I love the Bai Domnerb Song Kyar. Its a very unique dessert with sticky rice and coconut that is just the right touch of sweet. 
Bonus - this place is BYO!",1
3Wl58ou8llxY2UMRKwaICg,"Hallelujah! Downtowners and westsiders are no longer stuck in bagHELL--thanks to The Cleveland Bagel Co! 

Vacations are a wonderful thing, especially when you're finally able to take that brisk, relaxing walk to the local coffee shop without a looming meeting, etc. For me, that's Rising Star Coffee. And this sunny, average day turned into the best day on earth when I walked in and saw these gorgeous looking, authentic bagels for the first time. 

Apparently Rising Star starting carrying these glory bombs a while ago and with all my recent trips, I hadn't noticed? I don't even know how I've missed 'em--but oy! Grab a bag here, or visit them at numerous farmers markets around town. In fact, just follow them on social media and you'll be able to track them down. 

And for those of us who don't live on the east side, we no longer have to make the horrendous drive over to Bialy's, since these are just as good! 

Me? I ordered two sesame seed bagels with cheddar chive cream cheese to go. Every other cream cheese you've had is garbage. I promise. Just try their's and you'll agree. It's better than amazing. The bagels themselves are crusty on the outside, super-chewy, airy and moist on the inside--everything you'd want an authentic bagel to be. Next time I'll try the ""salt"" and ""everything"" varieties. 

Just do yourselves a favor and track these down. As soon as possible.",1
423AAbu0yBoDMOeVwnLzkQ,"Camino is my go-to restaurant in Cleveland. They offer an array of authentic, yet unique tacos that will keep you coming back week after week. My go-to tacos include the Baja, PB n Steak, Taco Dorado with chorizo and potato, and Short Rib, although I've never been disappointed with any of their other selections. They have awesome specials every day of the week, including half-off tacos on Monday, $5 wings on Tuesday, and $5 burgers on Thursday. And yes, their burger and wings (and all other offerings) are just as good as their tacos!",1
423AAbu0yBoDMOeVwnLzkQ,"I love Camino! Friends and I have been several times. The tacos are so fresh and fairly priced. I really enjoy their corn tortillas, not only because I can't eat gluten, but because they give an authentic taste. The other options here are just as tasty! However, the drinks can be rather pricey, which is why I am giving 4 stars. 
The outdoor patio is a nice place to sit and enjoy the downtown Cleveland atmosphere. There are other restaurants surrounding with outdoor seating as well so it is a fun experience.
The location is fun and close to many other bars and restaurants. The staff is decent. I really think the key to this restaurant is the food. Loosen up, order tacos!",1
423AAbu0yBoDMOeVwnLzkQ,"All I can say is WOW. I should have known this place was going to nuclear bomb, considering it is right across the street from Tomo; the terrible sushi house I reviewed. But I decided to try it because of the reviews. But now I know, you have to literally be drunk, in order to enjoy this ""food""

Now, I'm not suggesting that I have the palate of a world travelled renowned foodie, but dammit, I know canned food when I taste canned food! This place is the Chef Boyardee of Mexican Cuisine. From canned tomatoes, to canned refried beans, it made for a very bland, unsavory and unpalatable experience. I think the table, chairs and the silverware were canned too. Not suggesting that  canned food is bad; I grew up on it, but doggone it, THIS WAS SOME BAD CANNED FOOD!!!!!! 

Not only that, but they charged me for using a Groupon, charged me tax (expected), then charged me a ""pre-tax"" of $7.48. What the heck is a pre-tax??? I wish I would have taken a pic of the receipt! Since they added the extra money to my bill, I didnt bother tipping. The waitress was nice and checked on me often. But the overall experience of tasting this knock off, lackadaisical, weird canned food was extremely underwhelming.

 PLUG: Go to SENOR TEQUILA in Shaker Square. They have really great Mexican food, served and prepared by actual Mexican people, which makes for a delightful and more authentic experience. Heck, I'd go as far to say go to Taco Bell before going here. Yeah... Camino was that bad. I rate this with place 5 disgusted tongues",0

4k1TnOZ1pr9F-ITw-hmOmg,"My wife, unlike myself, has found her signature cut. However, going to a salon was a bit pricey since it's a short, half shaved look that need a bit more upkeep. So I sat mulling it over, and got a brilliant idea: a barber shop. I mean, her haircut IS more popular among men since she keeps a more androgynous appearance than I do; on top of that, stylists in salons try to give it too much pizzazz that ends up requiring more upkeep than she wants. 

Surely my wife, getting a men's cut on her delicate female head, would be better served at a barber shop; and hopefully since it's 2017 and all, the fact that she's female wouldn't matter so long as what she was having done aligned with what a barber shop offers. Right?

Luckily I was right on both accounts. We booked online easily, and arrived early to the appointment to scope it out. The interior is beautiful and is hipster in a way that - my LA born and raised hipster wife assures me - is authentic. The stylists are all engrossed in their work and clients, and no one bats an eye at my wife being there. She's treated just like any other client. 

Her cut took a half hour and it's by far the best she's had! She was seen by Ricky, and she hasn't stopped marveling at how amazing the cut is. She insists that it's the cut she was born to have, and she feels incredibly empowered. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a good barber!",1
4Ro6AiYhiinh6hly2Pbdfw,"Steak and G's, as it's affectionately known to us natives, is a veritable melting pot of people of all races, economic status, ages, and levels of recreational drug usage. The magic of this place is that it can unite these disparate groups under the banner of good, greasy, late-night eats. 

What should you expect when you walk in? Clearly, something that used to be a 1970s lounge. But today the once-soft light has been replaced with the harsh, unforgiving glow of the fluorescent bulb, illuminating the zombie-like gazes of hungry patrons anxiously awaiting their midnight meals. You'll spot the regulars -- the Unabomber lookalike in the corner scrawling mathematical formulas on his napkin while he pounds black coffee, the guy in the suit who may or may not be a friendly neighborhood pimp, and the obligatory gang of stoned high-schoolers playing nonsensical games with the hot sauce bottles on their table. Like I said -- a true cross-section of America. 

Back in my day (c. 2000), the food was prepared and served by a couple of amiable gentlemen of Greek descent, who I believe were the owners at the time. I heard they've since sold it. You will undoubtedly find a Flintstone-size log of meat rotating on its spit, a huge griddle good for scrambling up anything from pastrami to eggs to hash browns, and an arsenal of fryers just itching to whip up delicious French fries and mozzarella sticks. 

The must have items on the menu: an authentic Greek gyro, a corned beef sandwich with cheese and pickles and a side of fries, and the cheese sticks themselves. The later you go, the better it tastes. 

So here's to Steak And G's: trophy of the dives, titan of fried cuisine, the crown jewel of Shaker Heights restaurants. God Bless America, Amen.",1

The staff is indeed friendly, and the service is good overall.  Sometimes you have to wait longer than you like (depending on how busy they are).

The nice thing about this place (and many others) is it is not trying to be something it is not (like the commercial Irish pubs) and comes across as more authentic. I know a lot of people who still frequent here and they too enjoy the ambiance and the vibe.",1

And be prepared to get in there and cook your meat how you like it (though they do help you out a bit here unlike in Korea). The seafood pancake was perfection - light on the batter and lots of seafood. Order Soju and Cass and mix 2 parts soju to 3 parts Cass for an authentic and refreshing beer cocktail (thanks for the ratio tip, nearby table friends!). There are so(!!!) many side dishes (Banchan).

We asked for more lettuce and they accommodated our request. I personally thought the menu is overpriced; we ended up paying almost $150 plus tip. However, this was fun experience with friends hanging out over good food so the money that we paid was worthy it.",1
54ne9NBqgiWQAx0-RrOaFQ,"Huge portions, authentic dishes and hard working friendly staff.  Definitely worth the trip.  Try the pork schnitzel, and sausage and sauerkraut.",1
54ne9NBqgiWQAx0-RrOaFQ,"I readily admit, I came to Sterle's because it was on Triple D.  I visited somewhat late on a Friday night.  The restaurant is so huge, it can look empty even when there are a good number of people eating here.  There was polka playing, and some people were dancing.  It looked like a birthday party was wrapping up.  

This restaurant is good for kids- they can run around a little on the dance floor and not get in trouble (also they have typical kid's menu items in case they don't like Eastern European foods).

I am not sure why the name of the restaurant mentions Slovenia.  Other than one menu item (Slovenian Sausage), the food appears to be German.

I think Sterle's makes a few things in-house and those things are good.  Other stuff is honestly not so great.

Pro Tip: Don't be scared off by the $18 per person ""Sterle's Family Style Feast"".  When I first saw that, I thought it was only for large parties.  But upon inquiring, I was told that I could order that even though I was just a party of one.  I jumped at it because then I could try both the chicken paprikash and the Weinerschnitzel (both of which were featured on DDD).  You pick three items so I also added pierogies.

The chicken paprikash is the star of the show.  It's chunks of high quality chicken in a tangy, tasty sauce, all over a bed of soft dumplings.  The Pierogies are buttery and tasty and authentic.  The weinerschnitzel is maybe a little on the dry side, but good.  The Feast comes with a side of sliced bread, which I used to soak up some of the extra paprikash sauce (I also put some on the schnitzel).  It also comes with soup or salad and a dessert, and these were the bad side of the experience.  I picked chicken noodle soup and it was clearly from a can (it even had those short thin noodles which are a dead giveaway for Campbell's soup.  For dessert they have apple or cherry strudel or a brownie.  I probably should have gotten the brownie, but the waitress recommended the apple strudel, which was not very good.  I think it was from frozen...

So to sum up- definititely get the chicken paprikash, but be careful with some of the other items, they may not be made in-house and may not be very good.  For $18, I was completely stuffed.  I couldn't finish the schnitzel and took it home in a doggie bag.  I was so full, I didn't eat breakfast or lunch the next day either!",0
54ne9NBqgiWQAx0-RrOaFQ,"So disappointed. Sterles has recently been purchased by a new owner and I was so excited to come back here for the authentic traditional cuisine they've been known for. We came for the Mothers Day Buffet. It was pork schnitzel, not veal, and it was too dry. It also appeared to be deep fried. The pierogis were deep fried instead of sautÁE©ed. There were fried potatoes, scrambled eggs, French toast (no syrup), slices of ham that looked like lunch meat, chicken paprikas, stuffed cabbage.They were missing utensils to serve the food. We had to use the same serving spoon for multiple items. Everything was flavorless, tough and dry.  They one store bought dessert. No variety for the dessert at all.  We asked for gravy and were told they didn't make any today. 

We raised the concern with staff and were told the chef left early and everyone in the kitchen were on their own! No offer to comp or discount any of our meals which I felt considering they were aware it wasn't up to par, something should have been done.",0
54ne9NBqgiWQAx0-RrOaFQ,"I know these people. I've been here before. The waitresses stuffed into the authentic Eastern European dresses, the old timers shuffling to the oom-pah-pah tunes orchestrated by the tired and weathered accordion playing Polish DJ. The scenery is familiar too. The wood paneling, the scenic murals of a far away world printed on the walls, the families joined around the tables for a night of indulgence. The aroma's lofting through the dining room consisted primarily of meat and fermented cabbage; and in the distance, freshly percolated coffee. The smells. They are all familiar. I felt at home.

While I can't claim heritage to the Eastern European influence that Frank Sterle's Slovenian Country House represents, I'm familiar. There's always been a large population in NE Ohio. I'm familiar with the cuisine. I've been to many parties and gatherings in my time that felt exactly like the scene created that night at Sterle's. It was comforting. 

For dinner, we opted for the Family Style #1: Chicken Noodle Soup, Salad, Bread, Wienerschnitzel, Roast Pork, Sausage, Vegetables, Potatoes, Sauerkraut, Coffee and Strudel. All for less scratch than a single entrÁE©e at the Olive Garden would run you. And with more culture too. 

There aren't many places quite like Sterle's around anymore. This place reeks of ethnicity, nostalgia and soul. As long as Sterle's is around, Cleveland is a better place.",1
54ne9NBqgiWQAx0-RrOaFQ,"Upon my first visit, I immediately fell in love with the decor. The building and art has an authentic look. The staff was friendly and even had a charming accent. My party split an order of Bavarian pretzels, which taste great with the beer batter cheese. I had the Slovenian Sausage and Sauerkraut. It had a great taste, as did the dumplings on the side. Two of my friends had a beer imported from Munich, Germany. They were both very pleased with it. My only complaint is that the prices were a bit high; the cheapest meal was $15. However, if you are looking for authentic food, look no further.",1
54ne9NBqgiWQAx0-RrOaFQ,"If you are ever in the neighborhood, Do yourself a favor and drop in for a quick meal. The food is so so, but the atmosphere is AMAZING. Close your eyes, count to five, and open them again and you might just think you are in eastern Europe. The wait staff is authenticly dressed. The food is hearty and filling, but far from fantastic. Don't go for the food, go for the atmosphere.",1
54ne9NBqgiWQAx0-RrOaFQ,"Our first time visiting here! It's an awesome environment, love the authenticity and old feel of it! Service was great, food was fast. Don't get soup or salad- these aren't authentic or good, but the schnitzel and the meatloaf were AWESOME! Super good garlic potatoes. Such a hidden gem in CLEVELAND, check it out for sure.",1
54ne9NBqgiWQAx0-RrOaFQ,"Amazing.  Food = 4-stars, but with the atmosphere, service, and overall experience, it's a five-star place.

My family are all unabashed Germanophiles.  Each year, we host a huge Oktoberfest complete with Polka band.  ...And the food...

I admit that while we have searched out German restaurants far and wide (Pittsburgh, Philly, DC, Virginia...) we only heard of Sterle's from Guy Fieri.

We made the trip to Cleveland with about twenty family members are were not disappointed for a second.

The family style service is part of the fun.  Passing crocks of soup, piles of schnitzel, heaps of potatoes, and pitchers of beer around the table is part of the experience.

The schnitzel was wonderful.  Tender and crispy.  Sausages were authentic, and the saurkraut is definitely above par.  With the Oompah music from the live band and a dancefloor for the kids (and, after a few beers, the adults), it may be the best place for groups I've found.",1
54ne9NBqgiWQAx0-RrOaFQ,"Great place for some authentic Eastern European food. The atmosphere has an old world charm and the waitresses are extremely nice. Going with a relatively large group, their service was still pretty good and the food came out fairly quickly. We ordered the family style, which included everything from soup to dessert. It was my first time trying Wienerschnitzel, which was pretty good along with the potatoes and sauerkraut (my favorites). 

I heard they have music and dancing on Fridays and Saturdays. Unfortunately, I was there on a Thursday, but next time it'll be on a dancing night for sure.",1
54ne9NBqgiWQAx0-RrOaFQ,"Sorry but I have visited this place 8/6/2016 and was not impressed at all.
When I walked inside of the place it was very nice but soon as I got the menu is
where the problems started.

 The menu is a tiny little page with barely anything on it, my server recommended me
the $18 meal which turned out to actually be $23 after adding on iced tea + tip.

 I ordered Chicken paprikash, wiener schnitzel and home fries + piece of misly tiny sausage.
To make this quick the sausage was authentic Polish sausage which was delicious but was about size of my middle finger. The Schnitzel was pretty good however it wasn't seasoned properly at all, the vegetables could of came with breading which would of made them better than they were. Next came the nasty oily home fries which I got about table spoon size of then the chicken Paprikash which was absolutely disgusting and foul. The Paprikash must of been sitting around for a while and it wasn't even properly cooked the spicy sauce was ok but where the heck was the chicken? I took one bite ate a piece and pushed the bowl of the (dumpling Chicken Paprikash) away from my self. The iced tea was ok but it required tons of sugar added on to come to my liking (not taking star away from that).

 Overall I've had much better european food for better price and a lot more than what came on my plate for that price lets just say I came hungry and I left hungry (I am 130 lbs 5'5 male and 35 years of age so I don't eat all that much.)

 In my honest opinion I was very dissapointed in the food served here and will not come back again. When the cashier taking my money asked me how the food was I was honest with her and told her I was underwhelmed.

 Next stop Das Schnitzel Haus in Parma, I hope their authentic German food is up to par with my tastebuds and things are seasoned well also that I will get what I pay for.

PS. I got my food within 5 to 8 minutes of ordering so I know that the food must of been
microwaved which is a terrible practice too.

5CqM8dr3d3LI_B-1_-5U7A,"I just wasn't thrilled. 

We went on a Saturday night and had reservations at 8pm for 8 people. We walked into a gorgeous huge restaurant with beautiful rustic decor, and the entire place was empty except for one other table of 2. Only 2 more parties were seated while we were there. At 8pm. On a Saturday night....

I got excited when I saw a Pino Nero listed in their wine section. I've only had it once before and was told it was a white Pino Noir at the restaurant I tried it at. When I asked the waiter if it was, in fact, the same wine I was thinking of, he looked at me funny and said ""There's no such thing as a white Pino Noir."" I felt like an idiot in front of my friends. (I later googled it and discovered I was right all along)

As for the food, we all had something different, and none of us were thrilled. I ordered the scallops, as I ALWAYS do if a restaurant has them on their menu. They were small and not exceptionally flavorful. The risotto was undercooked, which is about as appealing as chewing on a mouthful of sand. 

We ordered zeppoli to share for dessert and it was dry, almost stale tasting and lacked imagination. 

The decor of this place is on point. The rest is mediocre at best. If a restaurant is going to be an Italian kitchen, I expect some serious authentic creativity. I felt like I was at a better accessorized Macaroni Grill. Spend your money elsewhere.",0
5VXxZIMgoKRWbNa6x9kMfw,"Amazing. This authentic 1940's soda shop is a true gem. The first time I walked in I was greeted by the heavenly smell of cinnamon and sugar, roasting nuts...  ahhh.

Homemade EVERYTHING from the ice cream and pies to the chocolate,
caramel corn, syrups and well, everything! Attention to detail is evident here.  The decor is perfect, exactly what you would expect if you were designing a perfect ice cream parlor and the spectacular array of choices make it completely worth your time and money. (and assault on any diet) 

The first Cleveland Dishcrawl ended the night here and was treated to amazing salted caramel ice cream sundaes.So, so good. 

On another visit, I had one of their french press coffees - for the record, I LOVE MY COFFEE - and this was perfect! 

I love that this place exists in Cleveland and wish it many, many successful years in business. Go. Now. Support this place.",1
5VXxZIMgoKRWbNa6x9kMfw,"This is the ice cream shop of my dreams.  There is nothing to dislike, unless you're a stickler for authenticity -- this place opened less than a year ago, but has the ambience of an ""old time soda shop.""

I agree with other reviewers that said the sundaes are big enough to share.  When I went, the people working were attentive and nice, but, most importantly, the ice cream was fantastic.  You can't lose if you order one of the signature sundaes.",1
5VXxZIMgoKRWbNa6x9kMfw,"This was exactly what the Detroit Shoreway needed.  Now there's no reason to not take the family down and explore Cleveland.   Since I wasn't around when soda fountains were all the rage I'm going to assume it's pretty authentic.  Much better than when I worked at Malley's in high school and had to wear a pink dress or green apron.  
I've been here a couple times and the ice cream and popcorn are some of the best around.  The salted caramel corn is heavily coated with just a hint of sea salt.  The hot fresh caramel is thick and creamy and amazing on the vanilla bean ice cream.  I've also had bananas foster ice cream but I might stick with the vanilla because it was so good.  
The only gripe I would have would be with the workers.  I worked in an ice cream shop in high school and for a couple summers in college.  It was a blast.  Have fun or smile a little bit.  Also, I think they need a better system.  I received my Sunday, started eating and finished (had to it was melting) before my friend received hers.  They served the people on the counter before they made hers so we had to watch each other eat.",1

#3: I can't believe this isn't in the top 2 reasons: the ice cream. Location is great. Customer service is fantastic. But, certainty they have an exceptional product to offer. Malts and milkshakes and sundaes... Oh my! I had a sundae on a Sunday evening - so fitting and so delicious! They also have candy for purchase as well. Don't worry, you'll get your sugar fix.

All Sweet Moses ice cream is homemade and served up from behind an authentic Bastion-Blessings soda fountain.

Toffee, fudge and brittles spend time cooling on the kitchen's marble slab, before they make their way to our candy case. Even the hot fudge and caramel sauces are fresh out of the kitchen.

For a limited time they were offering the Captain America combo (because they were filming the movie nearby), with strawberry, vanilla and blueberry. I had to give it a try!!  The ice cream is very sweet and solid.  I'm more of a runny, less sweet homemade ice cream kind of girl but I could tell from the crowd, the place is popular, the decor cute, combos yummy, great atmosphere!",1

68kpmZBEb6x7wG1HBeLQ3g,I liked the concept of this place but didn't find that the food was authentic.  I tried the gumbo and drunken chicken together.  The gumbo was a little watery and lacking the true taste of the rue.,0
68kpmZBEb6x7wG1HBeLQ3g,"I don't know about this place guys, I just don't know. 

I'm settling on 4 stars, but I have so many mixed feelings about this place. 

The good: the space and the service are great. The girl at the counter was ever so friendly and eager to offer samples and her recommendations on what she liked. This combined with how quickly the food is ready are largely the reason I'm settling on 4 stars. The space is big enough so that you don't feel cramped when you stop in here on a weekdays lunch surrounded by business men doing the same. The menu also has useful descriptions for those that are unfamiliar with what to order, which I find really helpful

What confuses me about this restaurant is what they define as a ""po-boy"" To me a po-boy is a sandwich served on a crispy on the outside yet fluffy on the inside baguette topped high with some form of meat along with lettuce, tomato pickles, hot sauce and some cajun mayo. This place defines a po-boy as any of their soupy mains served atop a generic submarine bun. You can also get it topped with cheddar cheese, sour cream and green onions, and somewhere in the middle of eating it, you realize what was once a sandwich has become something akin to chili floating on top of a bun to sop up the liquid. Now this isn't a ""bad"" sandwich by any means, but I have never seen this labeled as a po-boy; it really is something else entirely. 

To sum up: is the food here tasty? Yes. Is the price reasonable? Yes. Is the service friendly and fast? Yes. Is this what I would consider to be authentic Cajun/Creole cuisine? I don't think so. That probably wouldn't stop me from recommending to others, but with the full disclosure not to come here if that's what you're seeking out.",1

There sushi is not authenticated Japanese sushi, they are pretty much westernize.

However, if you want real sushi, you should go to Ginza Sushi House next to Progressive Field, where it will give you real Japnese Sushi.",0
6ExIH5FoPyMRhtz4p-2K1g,"My first meal in Cleveland, and I am only half impressed.

After a slow start (it took seven minutes for a waitress to even come to our table to say hi) , we ordered the vegetable roll, salmon roll, and lettuce wraps.  After insurmountable amount of time waiting, we finally got our appetizer (Seriously, how long does it take to put some already cooked chicken in sauce and then place it on lettuce wraps?). The chicken and lettuce wraps were a little too heavily marinated, and I had to brush off the sauce from the chicken in order to avoid sodium overload.
 
The vegetable sushi roll was humongous!  It was twice the size of the usual sushi I get from Japanese restaurants.  But it was absolutely delicious: crisp, juicy, and generous in amount, the vegetables really danced in my mouth.  This was definitely the highlight of the meal.  A five would be given just for this portion.

We also got the smoked salmon roll, which was equally as big.  The glob of mediocre cream cheese really did hinder the flavor from the surprisingly fresh salmon.  The kiwi on top of the roll worked, but there was overall a lack of flavor on behalf of the whole roll.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the Japanese American fusion nature of this restaurant.  It felt like a party/bar that really wrecked the calm ambiance of Japanese classy sushi.  I'm a big advocate for authenticity; fusion works occasionally, but in my opinion, not this time.",0

The food is authentic Italian - the head chef (Pepe) used to work at Valerio, which is I think the best restaurant in Little Italy aside from Il Bacio. 

Good:
* The food is just divine.  I have had the salmon linguine, a marvelous fennel salad, and a very fresh caprese salad.  I have also tried my dining companions' osso buco, trout, and cioppino.  I've had the lemon sorbet (homemade, served in a hollowed out lemon) and the tartufo.  All were undeniably excellent.
* Wait staff is attentive, very friendly and quite willing to explain dishes, or to explain the ingredients, and to tell you what brand of olive oil or pasta (DeCecco's, actually) they use. 
* It's not uncommon to hear people speaking in Italian here - my impression is that it seems to draw Italians from all over.

Can't think of anything bad about this place, except that it's a bit pricey.   Also, I don't know what's common practice at restaurants but I wonder why they use boxed instead of fresh pasta, but then again, the pasta dish I had was quite nice.

Had I cracked them open before sampling the four different take-out items, my fortunes should have read something like this:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
          Mystery Meat Chow Mein is in your future.                
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  You will soon be very disappointed with your order.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
        Don't expect happiness from China House.
----------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Maybe just plain bad luck, but out of three visits in 7 years, with at least 3 dishes each time, we've never had anything even ""fair"".   Nothing was ever salty, but neither did any dish taste even remotely Chinese.   I've never eaten canned Asian meals---don't know if there is such a thing---but this is what I'd expect it to taste like.

This last visit was the worst of all.  Maybe other dishes are okay, but what we ordered I'd never recommend.

CHICKEN CHOW MEIN * . . . Worst ""velveting"" preparation I've ever had.  Every chicken piece looked like---and had the texture of---fat.  Pale yellow and sponge-like.  After trying just two pieces, all chicken was shoved to the side of the plate, then thrown out.  I've made chow mein several times, and whatever China House did to get this unappetizing result was either a huge mistake or ignorance of Chinese cooking techniques.  Out of necessity, I added my own soy, sesame oil, and oyster sauce to the remaining ingredients, in order to flavor this unseasoned dish---which consisted of just celery, bok choy, and a total of 6 or 7 single onion wedge slices.  No other ingredients.   No bean sprouts, water chestnuts, mushrooms, or bamboo shoots.   

VEGETABLE EGG FOO YOUNG * *  . . . peas, carrots, bean sprouts, and eggs--- that's all.  No water chestnuts, mushrooms, discernible onions, or snow peas.  As basic as basic can get---and without flavor---except for the unpleasant ""earthy""-tasting fried exterior with burned edges.  The only redeeming aspect was the brown sauce and steamed white rice.  

PORK FRIED RICE * * * . . . the plainest-tasting and looking we've ever had.   Very few pork pieces, but at least no chunks of fat or gristle.

EGG ROLLS *  . . . a large (1.5"" x 1.5"") piece of hard, barely-cooked cabbage in the one I had.  Very firm exterior.  Was probably re-fried or re-heated---to warm it throughout---when we ordered.  If there was any ingredient other than cabbage, we didn't taste it or see it.

CARRY-OUT CONDIMENTS . . . no stars, since none were given.  No soy sauce, or hot mustard and sweet sauce for egg rolls, in the bag.  Used my own.   Contacted them and was given no apologies for the omission.  She said that they never give condiments unless they're asked for.  (Noticed no sign to indicate this when order was picked up.)

Because it had been about 4 years since our last visit, I ordered what I believe are the easiest to prepare and probably among the most frequently chosen.  I try these dishes first from all Chinese places where we've never eaten, BEFORE any other dishes.  If a restaurant can't get THESE right, I can't imagine they'll do a satisfactory job on others.    

CHINA HOUSE has the worst Chinese food we've ever eaten---all three times.  We gave it three tries and will never return.  When you think of all the wonderful ingredients that make up flavorful, inviting Chinese dishes---whether authentic or Americanized---from the unique vegetables, to the sauces and seasonings---but then to serve up such surprisingly bland results---with the absolutely bare minimum of poorly-prepared ingredients---I'd say it's time to return to square one, and begin using recipes from even the most basic of Chinese cookbooks.",0
7-K3HAcYkS92V0tdgmM2_A,I would eat here every day if I could (and do eat here a lot).  Definitely ask about the specials.  And the grape leaves are authentic Lebanese grape leaves.  Excellent gyros and hummus.  And really great people.,1
7-K3HAcYkS92V0tdgmM2_A,"This is the hidden jewel of Cleveland!! Very authentic, incredibly inexpensive, and more than you can eat!! The service is amazing. They obviously take pride in what they do! We look forward to many more lunch and dinner dates at Cedarland!!",1
7-K3HAcYkS92V0tdgmM2_A,"The best chicken shawarma sandwich I've ever had. Such great flavor, and the garlic sauce was so wonderful- authentic, like a paste, and I would take a bath in the stuff, I loved it so much. Friendly service, great prices, and the hummus had notes of a somewhat peanut buttery after taste- very good. I'll be back... More than I'd care to admit.",1
7-K3HAcYkS92V0tdgmM2_A,"Don't cha hate seeing 5 stars and don't cha wonder why? Did this establishment truly deserve 5 stars? 

Yes indeed! 
So this is a small, privately owned restaurant. You may dine in or take out. They have a sweet server who speaks limited english but she is so very pleasant with a big smile.

Serge, the owner....well make no mistake that he takes pride in his lil humble eatery.  He takes the orders , cooks and serves. He makes sure each guest is happy and it was pretty crowded at lunchtime. I only saw three employee including Serge... but every one made sure you were happy. 

Somehow my friends lunch order was overlooked, but when I asked Serge, he apologized more than once and brought us fresh, crispy Baklava as a peacemaker...like we needed it!

My Sharma  was warm and enough to share and my Kibbie was crispy. Very authentic Lebanese cuisine. 

Gonna make it a favorite lunch spot...plus it's a 2min walk from my job!",1

Dominic and his wife, Wendy, along with their staff, put so much effort into their menu and pairings for their wine dinners.

7M_wmSKg-qljRdwafdPKpg,"I encountered Umami moto when i was in downtown waiting for  july 4th firework. I got the famous Korean bbq burrito cuz my friend strongly suggested me getting it. It was pretty good but i guess i shouldn't really expect it to be really korean or authentic since it's asian fusion food. Anyways, good experience!",1
7M_wmSKg-qljRdwafdPKpg,"Umami Moto is pretty much my favourite take away lunch spot. Over the past few years, I've tried more or less every item on the menu and have yet to come away disappointed.

The Korean bulgogi burrito is incredible, especially the extra spicy version, and the pork banh mi is also great if not entirely authentic--it's on a sub, not a baguette. I'm also in love with the curry aioli-topped sweet potato tater tots. Bonus points for selling Mexican Coke!

Service can sometimes be a bit slow but is always friendly, and the wait is rarely any worse than the lunch hour lines elsewhere. The only real problem I have with Umami Moto is that they disappear during the winter months!",1
7MZArBbssmSOt-IPpR8YWw,"Flat out best Jamaican food in the city. Don't let the exterior fool you. Pull up, hop out, and treat yourself to authentic Caribbean cuisine of the finest order. Owner/chef Richie is usually dishing out the flavors 7 days a week!",1
7MZArBbssmSOt-IPpR8YWw,"Wow, what a great place. This is the epitome of a hole in the wall, but the guy running the place is super nice and friendly. Credit card machine wasn't working and he told me where the closest ATM was. It had a $1 fee and he gave me a $1 discount off my food without even asking!

There's only one table on the inside. Probably take your food to go if it's cold outside. There's a patio with a decent amount of seating in front of the restaurant. The menu has quite a few options, check out my photos of it. Judging by the tape over the menu, It seems like it changes quite a bit or some items are seasonal (there was a grill on the outside, maybe some taped off items involved that?). I didn't try it but they had sweet potato pie if you have a sweet tooth (wasn't on the main menu). They also had a few Jamaican sodas. The menu has a good variety of dishes and some you won't find anywhere else.

From what I've gathered, the food is authentic Jamaican home style cooking. It was delicious, but make sure you're ready for those bones! I got a ""small"" goat curry and a large braised oxtails to share with my wife. I love goat in general and the goat curry was great. It wasn't as strong as Indian curry, but it was still very flavorful. The braised oxtails were excellent as well. Both were served with a side of cabbage, rice, and beans. I don't know how to explain the cabbage, but I enjoyed it more than I thought I would.

I'll be back for sure.",1
7MZArBbssmSOt-IPpR8YWw,"Bratenahl Kitchen is pretty much just that - a kitchen, behind a bulletproof window, with a table inside and a covered patio outside. Food - amazing. Vibe - shady as f***. What it lacks in hipster appeal, it makes up for with plenty of personality and flavor. 

I drove up to one of the handful of parking spots located right off the road and had to double check that the ""OPEN"" sign was lit because it didn't look like anyone was inside the tiny shack, or the decrepit, tinier shack next door. Luckily, the door was unlocked and bells jingled to alert the proprietor/cook of my presence. The menu is succinct, but it was hard not to be distracted by the graffiti covering every surface (even the ceiling), all heartily endorsing the authenticity and tastiness of the food. A good sign. All the items are competitively priced too since the menu price includes tax. (But definitely include tip if you're happy with your meal.) Going with my gut, I projected at the ear behind the plastic that I wanted Shrimp Sautee. He nodded and disappeared into the domain of his kitchen. 

The place has a smell like spoiled vegetables and unwashed rags, which wasn't the most pleasant to wait in, but I hoped the graffiti wasn't wrong. One of the four chairs around the lone table was my temporary perch. An unseen radio was broadcasting some Winter Olympics event, so at least I didn't have to wait in silence. You may also choose to amuse yourself by reading the various signage, including the answer to the question, ""Is there a public bathroom?"" on the door to the kitchen (No) and ""Am I safe here?"" (Yes, potential goonies beware of the owner), and a myriad of religious fixtures. 

In short order my shrimp came, smelling a hundred times more fragrant than the rest of the dining area. He showed me my order in a takeout box through the window, an exchange of cash was made, and I collected my goods. All the utensils are disposable, so I guess a lot of labor is saved by not having to wash anything but the cookware. 

Now, the food - DELICIOUS. Like, currently salivating while thinking about it delicious. The shrimp were fluffy and covered in a rich, sweet, and smoky sauce. Fresh black peppercorns added a kick to the meal, and even the rice and beans I couldn't shovel into my mouth fast enough. These portions will definitely keep the munchies away for a few hours. 

I will be returning to try everything on the menu.",1
7sz9Rw1dbIEfLy-L9qB3Tw,"Chinese takeout. Rated 4 stars because lunch special is a very good deal and good amount of food and if you want typical Chinese takeout, this is a great place for it. Unfortunately, I am Chinese so I do not like takeout. I hear if you order in Chinese, they may serve more authentic Chinese dishes off menu, but I haven't tried it yet.",0
7sz9Rw1dbIEfLy-L9qB3Tw,"Good for Chinese fast food. Don't go in expecting healthy authentic Chinese food- it's fast food. Tastes way better than Panda Express and has a wide variety of options. 
I liked their Salt Pepper Ribs + Hot and Spicy Chicken Wings (which are not spicy at all) 
It's also nice that you can preorder online so you don't have to wait when you pick it up.",1
7sz9Rw1dbIEfLy-L9qB3Tw,"I'm one of those Chinese people that loves bad Chinese food. Sesame chicken and General Tso's are two of my favorites. There's just something weirdly sinful about getting your chicken tossed in some weird sugary goo that makes my taste buds jump up in excitement. Weird, I know, but I just crave it sometimes. 

However, when I come to Chopsticks, I often order off their special menu. It tastes pretty traditional and is so cheap. The variety has been increasing these past few years from when they used to have 1 or 2 un-written specials to a whole list. It is definitely one of my go tos when I want something authentic but don't want to drive all the way to Asia town. Affordable, quick and  pretty dang good. I'm definitely going to stay a regular.",1
7sz9Rw1dbIEfLy-L9qB3Tw,I've gotten take out from this place a couple of time. I swear they use the same sauce for EVERYTHING and it has a really strong vinegar flavor. It's basically your token cheap low quality Chinese place. Good for when you're feeling lazy and craving some semi-satisfying food. But if you're looking for flavorful authenticity- go somewhere else.,0
7sz9Rw1dbIEfLy-L9qB3Tw,"Five stars for a good, cheap Chinese takeout place in Cleveland and University Circle. It's also the only place around here that can satisfy my nostalgic food cravings for food I like to eat back home. It's strange to me that with so many Chinese students at Case there aren't more decent Chinese food places nearby. 

Basically they have two types of menus. The one on paper and on the big overhead boards are the ""Americanized"" Chinese dishes, such as orange chicken, Mongolian beef, etc. My partner who is not Chinese loves their General Tsao chicken lunch. It's a pretty good price for the amount of food, and you get a free soda or a soup.

The other menu is the more ""authentic"" menu that Chinese people who want Chinese food actually order from. It's on the left side wall written in neon colors. The menu changes from time to time but several dishes always stay. The one that I always order is the MÁE¡LÁE  noodle, because it somehow reminds me of MÁE¡LÁE  tang (éº»è¾£çE«). Even though it's still pretty different, the dish is as spicy and flavorful.

One of my friends said he's got food poisoning from their food but I've eaten here close to twenty times now and have never had any problems. I guess if you're in doubt, just go for the MÁE¡LÁE  noodles!",1
7W_PUqiBmoe2PVFGQ1ZBOg,"Let me start by saying that the waiter had to be laughing hysterically on the inside when he set a 25lb chicken Parmesan breast in front of my face. It was x3 bigger than my head--not an over exaggeration. 

And whatever chicken that came from had some huge hooters. 

This is the kind of Italian joint that brings you back to what you've seen in movies. A small space, loud talkers, laughter and copious amounts of wine and food. A truly authentic experience. 

But on to the important stuff: food. Although one dish could feed a small family, the portions aren't the show stopper, believe it or not--the taste is! Yes, my gargantuan chicken parmesan was delish and cut like butter. Super, super tender. The marinara sauce is spot-on with big chunks of tomato and the perfect amount of spice. Every entree comes with a choice of wedding soup of salad, both of which are delicious. A tip: get the salad with blue cheese and their balsamic dressing. 

Our party started with the appetizer platter, featuring calamari, brushetta, stuffed peppers and artichoke stuffed fried mozzarella balls. I'm not a big fan of calamari, so I can't comment on this. Everything else was divine, especially the stuffed peppers. After all this, plus warm bread with slap-me-in-the-face-that's-good garlic butter, I literally had no room for my dinner. My BF got their famous lasagna and it was perfectly formed, standing up-right with a ton of meat. He was a happy boy to say the least. Our friend got linguine with clam sauce and he got a full pound of pasta in a bowl bigger than two faces. 

For your money, you can't get a better value with super great, quality food. Not only are the prices reasonable, but you can order their regular entrees ""family style"" here and feed at least four people on the cheap. Not only did my leftovers weigh more than half of me, they feed us for days. 

The neighborhood is really, really sketchy. But, it's worth the trek over into the scary part of Cleveland-town to grab a bite.",1
7W_PUqiBmoe2PVFGQ1ZBOg,"ohhhh emmmmm geeeee! i seriously LOVE this place. like NOT just love it, but LOVE it. holy italian stallion. the food is authentic. home made pasta. home made salad dressings. home made everything. warm bread with AHHHMAZING garrrrlic butter! be still my beating heart. 
heads up: it is teeny tiny in there. 
make a reservation.
i have eaten at the bar which i am not opposed to, but if you have a group, you will certainly want a table and a reservation. 
i have yet to try their tiramisu, but have heard from many around  town that it is to DIE for. D-I-E!!! i have seen it. the last time we were there, i actually saved room for it, only to be told that they were sold out. um,  huh? sold out???? per our lovely server, ""mama only makes so much and when it's gone, it's gone'......so we tried a lemon something something and honestly, even that deserves high regards, and i am not even a lemony kind of gal. 
i would eat here once a week, if my hips would allow. unfortunately that would require much more time at the gym then i can handle!!!",1
7W_PUqiBmoe2PVFGQ1ZBOg,"Great authentic Italian food! The Clam linguini, lasagna, and blush sauce was amazing! That's all I had so far, can not wait to go back, really great prices as well. I know I am going to have them cater my next event.",1
7W_PUqiBmoe2PVFGQ1ZBOg,"So glad we tried Bruno's.  About drove by because it isn't much from the outside but I looked at another review that said the same thing so we gave it a chance.  Cozy ambience inside. It is small and gets busy so I would suggest a reservation. All of the food was amazing, from the wedding soup and Caesar salad to start, with authentic dressing, to the lasagna which indeed was the best we have had. We also tried the Pollo Romano which had a wonderful pesto cream sauce.  Everything was wonderful. We will be back.",1
7W_PUqiBmoe2PVFGQ1ZBOg,"I *finally* got to experience Bruno's.  As you know, I have been on a quest to find good Italian in Cleveland so I had to round out my search with a shuffle over to Bruno's.  For starters, the bar is really nice.  Old school bartenders.  The interior was way more updated than I expected compared to the sign out front.  I was expecting the old, shoddy red and white checkered tablecloths but instead was greeted with a nicely color coordinated restaurant.  Okay, the food.  I didn't like Bruno's red sauce.  I thought the sauce needed salt and seasoning.  It didn't have much garlic, either.  My penne was just penne.  And the meatballs clearly had been frozen based on their texture.  My boyfriend ordered a large (and I mean large-and-in-charge) calzone.  He said it was good.  This place is more about quantity than quality in my opinion.  I think Aldo's is a better authentic Italian experience, and I still claim that Nido Italia and Dolce Vita in Little Italy have way, way better meat sauce and marinara sauce.  Hell, Gallucci's, ""Mama Gallucci's sauce"" is better than Bruno's.  I really wanted to like this place but I've experienced better Italian food.",0
7W_PUqiBmoe2PVFGQ1ZBOg,"Some of the review on here made me laugh.  This is not a place for the hipsters. Sorry guys.  This is not a trendy side of town. Not Tremont or Ohio City.  Believe it or not, there is life outside of the suburbs too.  Is this the best area?  Heck no, that's why there is a security guard outside (whom you should tip on the way out).  However, at no point have I ever felt unsafe while being here.  

This is the most authentic Italian meal you will ever eat.  Not just food wise but the entire experience.   This is a small restaurant.  Maybe 10-15 tables depending on how they set them up.  Make reservations.  

Service is NOT slow.  We've had great servers every time we've been here. This isn't meant to be a meal you eat and leave within an hour.  That's not the way Italians eat dinner.  It's meant to be a time to sit and enjoy the company you're with.  They will being your appetizer.  When you're finished with that they'll bring the soup and salad.  They make the meals from scratch, so yes, they take awhile.  What's the rush?  Have some wine, enjoy the delicious bread with the amazing garlic butter and do as the Italians do!!  

There really are not enough words to describe how spectacular the food is.  This is the one place I will order something different each time I go and everything seems to get better and better.  You will also have enough food leftover for two more meals.  They don't skimp on portion sizes.  We've had everything from veal, scallops, chicken and just plain old pasta and every single item has been delicious.  

So, if you need somewhere to take good friends and family and you're looking for some good food, go to Bruno's.  You won't be disappointed!",1
7W_PUqiBmoe2PVFGQ1ZBOg,"This is probably the best Italian food I've had outside of Italy.  Growing up in an Italian family, I have unreasonably high standards and expectations for Italian cuisine, so I usually just avoid Italian restaurants altogether because it rarely measures up and I usually leave full but disappointed.  But the food at Bruno's was a delightful surprise.

It's as authentic as it gets. Everything, down to the pasta is homemade. The flavors are robust and the portions will satisfy even the biggest Sicilian appetite.  I had the lasagna and my girlfriend had manicotti.  The ricotta filling was creamy and savory. The sauce is just perfect: not too thin, not too thick; not too sweet, not too bland.  Beautifully seasoned.  We also had a very nice Chianti recommended by our server.

We had to have a little patience with the service but the place was very busy so that was fine. All in all, they took good care of us. You can't do better for Italian food in Cleveland.",1
7W_PUqiBmoe2PVFGQ1ZBOg,"Hidden gem that provides an authentic Italian experience!  The menu is good from top to bottom with large portions and exceptional red sauce.

We arrived when they were opening for dinner and we were hooked when they gave us their hot bread with garlic butter! We knew we were in the right spot. The Italian wedding soup & house salad was great. Attached is a photo of the eggplant lasagna. Good came out steaming hot full of savory flavors and spices. Wait service was excellent and didn't have to wait long, even when they brought me the wrong food out they fixed it in a jiffy and even gave a side of pasta while I waited.

7W_PUqiBmoe2PVFGQ1ZBOg,"This neighborhood landmark with an old-school vibe sits at the corner of W 41st and Cloud Ave, an area of Cleveland that for some might appear intimidating; however, do not judge a book by its cover. As you step inside you are greeted by the sounds of classic Italian tunes playing over the speaker system. The small, but initmate, dining area is accentuated by a wood paneled vintage bar circa 1957, which sits against a backdrop of top shelf liquor. 

Brunos epitomizes class and quality, both of which are wrapped in a layer of excellent service.  This place serves up delectable authentic Italian cusine at reasonable prices and is generously portioned. Moreover, every entree comes with bread and a salad, and each visit brings a great experience. On my last visit, I had the Linguine Pescatore, a decadent assortment of mussels, clams, salmon, shrimp, and calamari in a savory marinara sauce. For dessert, the tiramisu is made by Bruno's mother - and is as good as anything you've ever had.

I've been dining here for over 10 years, and not once have I had a negative experience. There are over a 100 Italian restaurants in the greater Cleveland area, this one is in my top 5!",1

7xfeQhen2wLnvFuQNvmTAg,I love this place. This is the best Indian food I can find in Cleveland and I've tried most of them. The restaurant is in a trendy part of Cleveland and is pretty clean. They always have a great beer selection and the food tastes authentic.,1
7xfeQhen2wLnvFuQNvmTAg,This is hands down my favorite restaurant in Cleveland and my favorite Indian restaurant ever!  I have spent a great deal of time traveling all over India and I can confidently say that the food here is truly authentic and the quality is exceptional!  They have the best chia and paneer in town!  I heard that there have been mixed reviews about this place but I belive that it is only because they got too popular too fast and just needed some time to properly staff and get into the groove of things. The owner is kind and conscientious and obviously takes great pride in what he is offering and makes you feel like an honored guest..,1
7xfeQhen2wLnvFuQNvmTAg,"I will start by saying: this review is based on a takeout order only. I didn't dine in, I ordered and picked up at 8pm on a Saturday. I know that food can be COMPLETELY different when you dine in, and perhaps this review would take a different tone if so. 

The staff was super pleasant, the atmosphere seemed decent. The prices are reasonably fair and my order was ready when I arrived. 

As for the food, I was left wanting something a little different. I'm an east coast transplant, so I have a huge exposure to great food (and Indian food) to base this review on. Seeing that this place is sought after by the Tremont locals, I gave it a shot! 

We ordered chicken tikka masala and paneer tikka masala with a side of garlic and cheese naan.  The curry lacked depth, and the chicken seemed like it was boiled/baked perhaps? It's sadly never seen the inside of a tandoor, or any grill/open flame/fire for that matter. The dish as a whole was extremely salty and it truly didn't even taste like tikka masala. No stand out traditional spices, no exotic and fun Indian flavors, just cubed chicken in a salty sauce.
The paneer itself was excellent, but it also shared the aforementioned flavorless sauce. Bummer.
The naan was puzzling. A super thin, very soggy dough that was slathered in butter, garlic and cheese. By cheese, I don't mean paneer. I mean shredded cheese. Imagine that Papa John's and an Indian street food place had a love child... That's the best I can do to describe it. It wasn't horrible, but it was by no means authentic naan. Note: this is the biggest piece of my review that would potential change with a dine-in experience. Wrapping hot things in foil almost ALWAYS translates into lost texture. 
The rice was surprisingly the most impressive part of the meal. Light, not over cooked, fresh. It seems like a simple thing, but excellent white rice is deceptively difficult to accomplish. 

Three stars for the rice, stand-alone paneer and the service.",0
7xfeQhen2wLnvFuQNvmTAg,Legit authentic Indian food that stays true to their word and menu. The staff is wonderful as well!,1
7xfeQhen2wLnvFuQNvmTAg,"We went to a buffet but there weren't many options to choose from, so we switched to A la carte. 

We ordered biryani which was not as authentic as everyone here claims. It was overloaded with spices.

The ambiance and service was decent. Parking is a hassale, if you are going during weekend, as you got to find you space by street.",0
7xfeQhen2wLnvFuQNvmTAg,Amazing food. Being Indian I can say it's authentic.  The new dessert mango kulfi is out of this world.  The owners go out of there way to accommodate special food restrictions like food without onion and garlic.  Will come again.,1
7xfeQhen2wLnvFuQNvmTAg,"I am so thrilled to have this place in my neighborhood! It's a welcome addition to Tremont and I hope it's successful. It's been open a week and I've ordered out once and dined in once. 

The good:

-the food is delicious. Half my family is Indian so I've had my fair share of authentic Indian cuisine. Tandul does not disappoint! Bold flavors & fresh food! Truly delicious.

-the people who work there are very nice and want their customers to have a good dining experience. When mistakes were made (which is bound to happen when any business first opens) Andrei (I'm assuming he's the owner or manager) apologized and comped items on our bill.

-takeout was ready within 10 minutes of ordering and everything we ordered was accounted for!

The not-so-good:

-the portions could be a bit larger. The prices are comparable to other Indian restaurants but the amount of chicken in the chicken vindaloo and the paneer in the saag paneer left something to be desired.

- this place needs to cultivate better communication among employees as well as clear job duties. When we dined in, (it was a Saturday night) we weren't sure who our server was and we'd ask one person for something and it would not be communicated to other staff, thus, we wouldn't be served something we ordered and waited a long time for our food, our drinks, and our bill and had to ask a few people each time. Andrei comped one round of our drinks and bought the whole restaurant (which was packed) a round of cocktail shooters, which we really appreciated-- it shows that they're trying and want to succeed.

I will definitely be going back and ordering out from this place again and I recommend you do the same. Just be patient as they work through the kinks. I would love to see this place flourish and stick around the neighborhood for years to come!",1
7xfeQhen2wLnvFuQNvmTAg,"Stumbled upon this place while looking for a Saturday afternoon brunch. Decided to try the lunch buffet. Couldn't be happier! Friendly staff, authentic delicious Indian food and the bar was plus!! Would recommend the naan, mughlai chicken, pepper mushrooms and the paneer!!",1
7xfeQhen2wLnvFuQNvmTAg,"Ordered take out.  Was impressed by the quality of the sauces as far as authenticity and spice balance in both the Butter Chicken and Chicken Tikka Masala.  Garlic Naan was pretty soggy from sitting in foil for 30+ minutes but what do you expect from takeout.

What I was dissapointed by was the chicken had a low quality to it, it was rubbery and not cooked right.  Luckily there was barely any in our meals even though  they were 17 bucks a piece, which is another concern.

I'm going to round 3.5 up to 4 stars and wait til I can dine in to give a follow up.",0

I would have give them one star but just because of the daal, I am giving them two stars. If you are thinking to try some authentic Indian food, then you are in wrong place!!! Be very careful about food allergies!!!Overall all for us this is a below average Indian Restaurant !",0
7xfeQhen2wLnvFuQNvmTAg,"From the outside, Tandul doesn't look very impressive as it is on the first floor of what appears to a converted house, but on the inside, it has a very rustic, homey feel with old hardwood floors, patched plaster walls and doors and windows leftover from bygone days.  The restrooms and visible tiny kitchen in the back are well-worn but functional.  The old school bar in the front was very nostalgic.  

We came on  a Saturday evening.  The restaurant was mostly empty when we arrived but filled up quickly.  It was not packed like many of the trendy spots on Professor Ave,  but it had a nice mix of young and old.  The many Indian patrons was a testament to the authenticity of the food.

My group ordered a sampling of appetizers and curry dishes.  All of the dishes had a spicy kick but not overpowering.  Our Indian companion found the sauces and flavors to be spot on.  Like most Indian places, the portion sizes are small for the price so you do have to order several items.  We also had a sampling of desserts which tasted well made.",1
7xfeQhen2wLnvFuQNvmTAg,"Although this review has been long over due(almost a year), it deserves to be submitted. My friend and I stumbled upon this place on our road trip from Detroit to NYC. 

We love Indian food(duh, native country bro!!!). And this place does not disappoint. I would say that Tandul is one of the Indian restaurants in the United States trying to provide Indian food as authentic as possible.

Overall the ambience, layout, location, etc was perfect. The guys waiting on us were courteous and tried to fit in the modification to our order to the dot. 

Must visit. And do not forget to try the Chilli Paneer !! Yummmmm...",1
7xfeQhen2wLnvFuQNvmTAg,"Food was excellent, and a very authentic cultural experience. Loved it and would recommend for anyone looking for a good Indian meal!",1
7xfeQhen2wLnvFuQNvmTAg,"I have driven by this place quite a bit and never realized it. Tucked between two popular clothing boutiques, Tandul adds something special to Tremont.

This is one of the first Indian restaurants in CLE I've ever felt was truly authentic. In a hard decision, I ordered the chicken tikka masala, while my friend opted for the vegetarian paneer tikka. I was delightfully surprised by how hearty the portions were, and thought it was unique that the paneer tikka came on a skillet (i've always seen it on a skewer). Our food was all around colorful, flavorful and served with generous portions of white rice. I also recommend getting a side of their butter naan to round your meal out!

The front half of the restaurant is a bit dark. While there's some ambient twinkle lighting, the nob could be turned up a bit more to be well lit. Otherwise, the restaurant is comfortable with hybrid couch/chair tables and high tops. There also seems to be plentiful street parking near their block, especially in the evening when the surrounding boutiques are closed. Will definitely be coming back here again...and I loved how on our way out, the manager gave us a $10 coupon off our next delivery order! Nice work, Tandul.",1
7xmuQuhpzBlkkSbWePFeVQ,"I really liked this place. The staff was very friendly and the food was not your typical Mexican fare. The food is very authentic. I wanted some guacamole and asked if they had some on the menu and was told that they didn't . A few minutes later the Chef personally made and brought us out some guacamole , who does that? I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. And the guacamole was awesome !!!",1
7xmuQuhpzBlkkSbWePFeVQ,"So good!  I had no idea that the wonderful little West Market Stand now also has a full fledged restaurant.  It is no longer BYOB as mentioned in other reviews and cute as heck.  Having been to Mexico many times, it felt authentic...more cafe like and relaxed.  The vanilla ginger infused tequila was delicious and so was the food.  Don't expect punch you in the face spice or heat.  This food has a more subtle feel to it. The flavors meld together beautifully and unfold slowly.  Don't pass this up on your next visit to West 25th street.",1
7xmuQuhpzBlkkSbWePFeVQ,"Ummm, did you say avocado salsa? Oh, yes, you did--and it was delicious. 

The man and I were hungry and looking for some take-out in the OHC. He randomly mentioned that although we've bought a ton from their stand at the WSM, we've never eaten at Orale's new restaurant. I can't even tell you what took us so long to come here, considering we know we love their food. 

Anyways, yes--the inside is tiny and could seat maybe 15-20 people, tops. But, the taste of the food is huuuuge. I mean, ordering mexican take-out is always a gamble. Things can get pretty soggy on the journey home. Not my steak tacos! Ohmygod... tender flank steak, chopped tomatoes, cheese and avocado salsa wrapped in corn tortillas. It's like heaven in taco form. I can't even imagine what their beer battered avocado tacos must taste like. The man got the vegetarian sandwich and I didn't hear a peep out of him while he was mowing this thing down. We also both got cups of the tortilla soup with chicken, which was smoky and delicious. I loved that it wasn't cream-based, but spicy and tomato based. Definitely more authentic. 

One thing I will say is that although their handmade chips are delicious and fresh, I wish they seasoned them with salt. But then again, I love salt and we didn't have salsa with our to-go meals to pair them with. 

The best part was when I checked in on my mobile Yelp app, which magically supplied me with a ""10% off our entire check"" offer! I asked the server who asked the owner and she said she had just put that check-in offer up that day! So cool that they're offering up deals to yelpers.

The food is fresh, delicious and authentic. I can't wait to return to try more of the menu and enjoy our meal at Orale instead of grabbing take-out!",1
7xmuQuhpzBlkkSbWePFeVQ,Yuk!  I'm a fan of authentic Mexican and this place does not fit the bill. The menu looked good and I'm all for trying the little hole In the wall with quirky decor but it was a big disappointment.  We tried several of their salsas - all were painfully bland. I got a salad that was so generic I felt like I was eating from one of those grab and go freezers at a gas station. My husband's food looked a little better but he said the meat was over cooked and rubbery - ew!  Margaritas - not good either. I'm sad because we really could use a good little Mexican place in our neighborhood. To add insult to injury - the bill was comparable to what we would have paid at one of those upscale bar/restaurants across the street. . . . . Live and learn.,0
7xmuQuhpzBlkkSbWePFeVQ,"Perhaps it was my mistake for assuming that this was a more authentic approach at Mexican dining! While their waiters and waitresses were truly lovely, the food was extremely underwhelming and their ""Vegan Tuesday"" selection was downright inedible--my dish tasted embarrassingly like reheated ""Amy's"" pre-frozen dinners! I don't think I will return here to dine, although I could enjoy a drink or two! West 25th has so many excellent selections for dining that this seems almost like an eye & stomachache at the end of the street! I would only advise you come here if you're open to a truly new experience or a completely free-handed take on Mexican fare!",0
7xmuQuhpzBlkkSbWePFeVQ,"Service was good. Food was terrible. Was like eating cafeteria lunch, and we paid $70 for it. I only leave bad yelp reviews when it's really bad, and it was. So inauthentic + small portions for price. Wish we could get our money back.",0
7xmuQuhpzBlkkSbWePFeVQ,"I am a HUGE fan of Orale's stand at the Market.  I cannot get enough of the habanero and papaya salsa and all of their enchiladas.  So we decided to try out their new restaurant location.  Yes, it's small.  I like the intimate, cozy feeling actually.  But black banquet chairs and faux wood grain tables?  Come on.  PIck something slightly more authentic and fun to match the wit of your brand's personality.  Onto the food...I opted for two appetizers...the chicken mole tamale and the empanadas with charred tomato sauce.  The tamale ingredients were *very* dry.  And judging by how much steam came out it when I cut into it, it was microwaved.  Disappointing.  As for the empanada, it was delicious.  The shredded beef was on point and I could have licked the charred tomato sauce off the plate.  My boyfriend had the gazpacho and said it was just okay but he loved the spring mix salad.  The menu is very small and they don't have a liquor license.  If I am in the mood for ""mod mex"" I'll go to Momocho every time.  I don't like Ohio City Burrito so this place falls somewhere in between.  I don't think I would search it out for a dining experience but I will continue to buy my salsas and enchiladas from their market stand.",0
7xmuQuhpzBlkkSbWePFeVQ,"Ok, Orale!  You got me!  If you can use an exclamation point in your name, I can use it in my review!  

First off:  Salsas!  
Holy crap.  So good.  We got two to start us out and they were as different as can be and completely different from normal salsas you'll get at an average Mexican restaurant.  Then they brought out the pineapple salsa...Mmm!  

Second off: Small plates! 
We ordered the Empenadas and the entree of Pork Chop.  Both were great, although the Empenadas could have use a little of some sort of sauce because the mixture of goat cheese was almost drying to the already dry-ish empenada.  Nothing against Orale, that's just how empenadas are.  

Third off: Beer! 
It's BYOB.  I love this!  Especially since there is a convenience store next door where you can buy a huge bottle of Corona for next to nothing.  It really helps even out the price and make the evening's experience less expensive than any other nice restaurant.

Overall: Success! 
We loved our food, we loved our Corona, we loved our salsas.  I would love to have a party there, bring in some Margaritas and just buy lots of small plates.  It's a wonderful authentic tasting contemporary Mexican cuisine destination.",1
7xmuQuhpzBlkkSbWePFeVQ,Was in town from Boston for the NBA Finals and went into this place because it had the longest line...figured the locals knew a good place - food was reasonably price - very homemade and authentic - burrito was an 8 or 9 out of 10 and I know burritos - get them everywhere,1
8B6HoeMy-xCeOarkMANdZA,"It's a small r3staurant that is not visually anything special. The food how ever is perfect. I'm not Hispanic so I can't speak to how authentic the food is, but we were the only non Hispanics in the place. I loved every bite of my food and the passion fruit smoothie. The serve was very nice and answers all are questions.",1

Not a fancy place but full of flavor and the staff is superb. . .

Thank s guys good job.",1

8B6HoeMy-xCeOarkMANdZA,"We came to Cleveland from PA for the Holiday weekend and decided to try this place because the food looked good and authentic. The food is very good but the reason why I have to give this place 3 stars is because of the poor service. They seemed to be short staff so it took a very long time for the server to take our order. We ordered empanadas that never came and one of us wanted the fish and the server said the kitchen wasn't going to make it because they were busy. Right after, we ordered drinks that came after the food came and after we asked for them again. Yet again, we had to ask for an extra juice that they forgot which all were overly sweet by the way.  After we ate, the server brought the check and said - did you guys get everything ? It seemed like she already knew we were going to miss stuff. We told her we never got the empanadas and didn't even receive an apology, or offer to come back. I also thought the sides were expensive ($7.00). I think this place has potentials if they focus more on customer service.",0
8B6HoeMy-xCeOarkMANdZA,"The most authentic Caribbean/Hispanic food in town! Large portions, friendly atmosphere, lively music! Reminds me of being on vacation in Punta Cana. The food is delicious and fresh! It doesn't get better than this!!",1
8KkpSMrfBz1c_0p3m6Y6dg,"There's a lot to like about the Ohio City Galley. The atmosphere and decor is very modern/industrial with a very open concept. The food options are very diverse and spread across many cultures and palates. And the fact that there is a bar along with the four restaurants is just a bonus. I decided to try sauce the city and the signature Cleveland Hot Chicken Sandwich. Overall, it was a delicious messy spicy crunchy sandwich. There was a Nice refreshing slaw on top of crisp sauces chicken. The heat was not quite as intense as advertised for the second hottest level. The sandwich came along with a side of street corn. The street corn was served pretty authentically but mine was rather mushy and reminded me of a frozen ear of corn. Overall, sauce the city brings a lot of flavor with a bit of local twist on the hot chicken trend.",1
8KkpSMrfBz1c_0p3m6Y6dg,"I am in love with this concept! What I'm even more enamored with is the 3 min walk it takes me to get here... holla holla! 

I went for the Grand Opening last night and was super excited to try all of these unique restaurants with inspiring flair on the standard dishes we know and love.

Summary:

The Rice Shop (essentially like a Poke place - but they did have a delicious looking chicken bowl with broccoli and rice. That's the one I'd grab since I'm not huge on the raw fish movement lol)

Tin Man (I think the vibe here is like... an All American experience. They have a DELICIOUS burger, onion straws, chicken and dumplings, pot roast, apple inspired dishes and desserts) 

Sauce The City (to DIE for crispy deep fried chicken with a bounty of flavorful sauces - Homestyle, Cleveland Hot and Sauce Fire Hot - which I can only imagine how intense that one is as I smelled the heat coming off a plate that passed by me. They have a fun spin on fire roasted corn on the cob and of COURSE, Sweet Tea!)

POCA (a very authentic Mexican restaurant. This isn't like your standard places. This is a straight from Mexico (classy establishment) type of Mexican (Oaxacan inspired to be specific) with chicken thighs and mole sauce and tamales. This isn't your ""grab a taco"" kind of Mexican. They have guacamole with a nice citrus flavor and robust jalapeÁE±o kick which they serve with a side of mole sauce - this stuff has some heat behind it, ayiyi!)

Now let's talk about the bar! And the seating! Omg you guys, we have too much to cover. Am I going to be flagged for saying too much? Will I run out of characters? The world may never know!!!

So once you pop in the doors of the place you can go left to the restaurants or right to the bar... ""ight to the bar"" is usually my motto... tehehe. Never fear if you've steered to the left first... this place works in a circle and you can always find your way through the back end of the bar. The open floor and beautiful lights were amazing! Who doesn't want to eat in this kind of environment? The bar was very modern and offered up all kinds of ritzy true mixologist created cocktails with ingredients I had to google, of course. That's a mark of a real trendy place, I tell ya! They have a nice list of fun draft beers too!

The seating is spread all around the place and you can either sit at a larger communal table with others or a smaller table for intimacy. You set your number down from your restaurant of choice and some impressive treasure hunt wizards roam the floor to find you. Truly a difficult task, if you ask me. Kudos! I wonder if the training was successfully finding Waldo in a series of photos LOL - especially food courts. 

All in all I really enjoyed OCG! From a pocket book standpoint, it's not a place you hit up daily. It's pretty expensive, namely the bar, but if you're in the mood for some legitimately homemade cuisines and hand crafted cocktails with a more casual vibe... this is your place!!!p",1
8KkpSMrfBz1c_0p3m6Y6dg,"I love the concept of a food hall and open seating and happy that Cleveland is welcoming more of these concepts. This galley is just past the bustle of W.25th and offers free parking. It feels like you are getting a fancy experience upon walking in here, but I was not a huge fan of the food. There was an Asian restaurant that had since left, but featured a glorified orange chicken Chinese takeout dish. I felt some of the restaurants had sacrificed authenticity to cater to more audiences with fancy taste. I probably won't return unless I am with a group of friends or for business purposes that would need more food options.",0
8v2HR0gy_fZOaOpdjsH4Mg,"These cards were INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE; over $90 for 100 cards! The online templates were decent, and the main reason I ordered from them was because they do soft touch cards.  Unfortunately, the colors in the template online were VERY different from what was shipped to me.  The customer service was dismissive and miserable, discounting my concerns from the beginning, but offering me a discount for my next order.  Umm, really?  They use goofy ""hot""  catch phrases like telling me to, (""stay hot!""...)  in all their responses; canned and inauthentic. Definitely got the cold shoulder. Would NOT recommend them, ever. A waste of time and money.",0
8yZ_nBgRC3CT1RFJC6KhXA,"Give me my girls, a few bucks, and an evening to burn, and we'll spend a few hours here laughing and chowing down some good eats, downing more than a few mugs of coffee and listening to the pianist who comes in on weekends play showtunes (he has a particular affinity for The Sound of Music).

Give me a Frisco salad (served with a warm muffin rather than boring 'ol bread) some Texas noodles, and a homestyle apple dumpling for dessert, and my belly will be happy.

Give my not-quite-two-year-old niece Mya a cafeteria-style carton of milk and a straw, and she will no doubt spill it all over herself.  But she will feel better if you give her a bite of your peach muffin and a dollar so she can tip the nice piano player.

Good times, good prices, staff that knows you after the second time you come in, and a nice, chilled out place to hang with your friends and have a great, home-cooked meal.",1
9_0FtoabuC42T7AWDk5_sA,"Don't be intimidated by the front door or the dark atmosphere when you first step in. I know I was on my first visit.  

I remember walking in and feeling like everyone had stopped what they were doing and turned around to see who the non-belonger was standing alone at the entrance. But that was all in my imagination, I think.

I have since become a regular algebra-goer, coming here at least once a week for my fill of delicious coffee, tea, and authentic Mediterranean food

Owned and built by a Case alum, this gem of a tea house really delivers on uniqueness, authenticity, and atmosphere. With their one of a kind handmade tables, cups, wooden plates, artwork, they really leave their mark as one of the coolest coffee houses in Cleveland

You really can't go wrong with any of their food, I am a big fan of their falafel and shawarma. Their hummus is also very good, but a little tame for me, I like my hummus more offensive with more lemon and a tad more garlic, but that's just a preference thing. Algebra is also very vegan friendly and has a large assortment of healthy menu options. Isn't it a great feeling to finish a big meal and still feel healthy afterwards?

Their drinks are not for the average venti-mocha-frappuccino-with-extra-whipped-cream 'coffee' sippers. As is the food, the drinks are authentic and are generally not too sweet, if at all. 

If you are unsure of what to order, I recommend the chai tea and perhaps the falafel sandwich as starters

My only gripe with this place is that they aren't too consistent because they have a different person working there almost everyday, all of whom have their own slight variations on food and drink prep, so if you liked the chai tea you had Monday morning, you might not like it as much Wednesday night.

But this place delivers on so many other aspects, that I can't bring myself to give them anything below a 'as good as it gets'
So come check this place out, order an iced chai tea with falafel sandwich, you won't be disappointed!

And remember, on your way out, it's push not pull :)",1
9_0FtoabuC42T7AWDk5_sA,"Love the relaxed atmosphere. So welcoming... It's like you're at a close, kind of kooky/very artsy friend's or relative's house. Love it. The owner made pretty much all of the art and serveware in the place; that's dedication to your craft! The owner is also super nice and friendly. He is in all the time saying hello to customers and managing the place.

Great drinks and very authentic Palestinian coffee. 

The food is fantastic and actually the most authentic Arabic/Middle Eastern food I've had in the Cleveland area. They have really great hummus and the falafel is fantastic (note that I am a huge hummus and falafel snob). 

I love bringing new people here to experience it. Can't say enough good things. Down to earth, authentic and just a great place to be. You can study here for hours or have lunch with a friend.",1
9_0FtoabuC42T7AWDk5_sA,"This the quirkiest, artsiest, and most delicious cafe in the Cleveland area. There is comfy seating, Bedouin type decor, and authentic, freshly prepared Middle Eastern food. The owner of the cafe is a wonderful artist who takes great care with all aspects of the cafe (his studio is in the basement). 

The tables and mugs are all handmade by him, as is much of the artwork. I also want to add that pretty much everything here is made from scratch. He soaks chickpeas in large tins overnight to make fresh hummus. The muhamarra is pretty much to die for and the coconut almond chai is amazing. It doesn't get much better than this.",1
91diBNaSiwHr6tUXXJee-Q,"Another bad addition to Little Italy.

Anthony's is a newer place in Little Italy.  I thought we'd try it for kicks after having poor food at other Little Italy restaurants (note: Little Italy is for tourists, not for people who know Italian food; there are better options around Cleveland).  

Strike 1:  environment
This place is rented and the owner has put all of $0 into it.  It has no charm, the a/c doesn't work, and it looks more like a place that could double as a costume store during the Halloween season than a permanent restaurant.   Cheapest chairs and tables a thrift store can offer.  There was NO ONE seated inside due to the lack of a/c and only 4 tables of people outside.  This should have been a sign.

Strike 2: menu
Wine here is inexpensive.  A very good value on many of their wines.  The food menu, however, is whacked.  This is supposedly an ""Italian"" restaurant, but the menu does not illustrate this.  No noodle selection (only 2 types of ravioli or spaghetti), and no sauce selection (only marinara or bolognese).  They DO list a vodka-blush sauce on their menu, but as I will get to in this review, they don't have it.  Furthermore, the pizza menu is beyond logic.  For a medium pizza for say, two people, they charge $3-$6 per topping, and most toppings are $6.   So a medium pizza with say, feta and spinach would be around $30.  And remember, this is NOT a nice restaurant.  This is a rented ""space"" that is dishing out food.  So no wonder no other tables were eating pizza either.

Strike 3: food
I am Italian.  A mix of Northern and Southern.  I have been cooking authentic, Italian food since I could stand on a stool in front of the stove.  The food here is disgusting, and it is clear from the sparse and bizarre menu that the owners know nothing about Italian food.  I ordered, for lack of other choices, cheese ravioli with  a ""vodka blush sauce"".  Remember what I said earlier?  Well, what came to me was a plate of ravioli drowning in a roux.  Yes, a ROUX!  That's flour and butter to thinken gravy (those of you who don't cook), and there is no reason on this earth that there should be a roux on a plate of pasta, or any other plate.   I sent it back, and the waitress assured me that there was no flour in it.  Really?  So you, Cleveland waitress who pronounces ""marinara""  as ""mayrinayra"", are going to tell me what is and is not reality?  I said please bring bring me the spaghetti and meatballs instead (sadly, this was the only other choice on the menu).  

Strike 4: service
The waitress came back 5 minutes later and said that she knows for sure that the sauce doesn't have flour in it.  I replied that whoever told her that lied to her, which she responded was the owner.  I said, ""then the owner lied to you.  You brought me a bright yellow, heavy, pasty mess of flour and butter.  It was not pink, it had no marinara in it, there is NO CONFUSING it (blush sauce is marinara plus a dash of cream and butter to give it a bright pink and light consistency).   The waitress that doesn't know food or how to pronounce ""marinara"" had the audacity to argue with me.  If I weren't with a table of very gentle people, my Italian side would have erupted here.  Instead, I just took a deep breath and waited for the peasant-food spaghetti and meatballs.  By this time everyone else at the table had finished what they wanted to eat of their meals, so we waited.  And we waited.  Finally, I asked that the spaghetti be put in a take out container.   And a 25 minutes later, the spaghetti with meatballs arrived.   I left a 15% tip which was overly generous given the circumstances, but the waitress was very nice up until the sauce incident, and we left, determined never to let anyone come to this shameful attempt at a restaurant again.",0
98hyK2QEUeI8v2y0AghfZA,"I like this little pho place. They have the best bun bo hue in Cleveland area. I was so impressed of how flavorful the soup was. My friends ordered pho and they both loved it. However, I really didn't like their peanut sauce for the summer rolls, maybe because I was not used that type of sauce. Overall, this place is super authentic and fast. You should definitely check this place out!",1
98hyK2QEUeI8v2y0AghfZA,PHOLEE PHOOK This is good stuff! This is my new favorite pho place in town. I've been here twice. The business is just picking up so there aren't very many people so no waiting in line. Both times I ordered the biggest bowl of pho and it was delicious. It is very authentic the Vietnamese family that owns this place is legit. The bahn mi is also really good it has a great French baguette and patÁE©. I did try the other side dishes and I would say stick with the pho. For context I've tried almost every pho restaurant in Cleveland and this is for sure the best.,1
98hyK2QEUeI8v2y0AghfZA,"Really impressed with Pho Lee. First off, they're not located in Asia Plaza, which I learned by mistake and 30 minutes later after placing our order, piecing together from menus on Yelp and Google maps. It was pretty funny as I called the place twice and the owner said he'd meet me in the plaza- it's the other Asia Plaza which name eludes me at the moment. Toll_?

Onto the food was really impressive - fresh flavor and ingredients. Agreed on the Ban Mei sandwich is the best I've had - love the bagette. The meat is sparse, but they give you what's specified on the menu which other locations that serve this sandwich don't - pate, pork, ham and the Vietnamese toppings. Ask for a fried egg on top to take it to the next level! They questioned me on this initially then ""Oh! You mean a sammie"". It was awesome and for $7 SFG! 
The Pho is excellent and add extra meatballs for $3. The BBQ beef ribs over vermicelli with an egg roll--this is the only place in Chinatown that serves this (I've hit all of the spots) and so, so good! These guys know authentic Asian food and are so grateful to have you try them out. Please do, you'll be so happy that you did.",1
98hyK2QEUeI8v2y0AghfZA,"Ehhh... It was just okay. 

First, the service, I came with my family of four. No one greeted us at the door, instead the staff stood in the back and looked at us oddly. The least they could have done was motion us to sit anywhere we'd like. The server, who was a teenager, was unexperienced and unknowledable about the menu and spilled water all over the table. We moved to another table. She forgot to replace the spilled water cup despite asking two times. It was also an unpleasant environment, the owners three children were running around, yelling, and it echoed throughout the establishment. 

Now onto the food, coming from a Vietnamese background, I have eaten authentic Vietnamese cuisine and the food was just okay. 

I ordered the bun bo hue and like another review mentioned, it was missing key ingredients like pork blood cubes. Also, there was no spice to the broth. 
My family ordered the pho dac biet and had no complaints on it. Another member ordered the vermicelli noodles and said the meat inside the rolls were spoiled, and ended up picking all of them out of her dish. The fish sauce was odd, lacking flavor and weirdly salty. 

I do not think I'll be coming back, and if I do I would just stick with the pho.",0
98hyK2QEUeI8v2y0AghfZA,"This Vietnamese restaurant is different from others. I've been to most Vietnamese restaurants in Cleveland such as, Minh anh, superior, #1 pho, and bowl of pho and pho lee has the most traditional dishes. The menu is a bit smaller but the food is more authentic. Being Vietnamese myself I prefer this place if you want anything other than pho. Prices are cheaper than most as well! Give it a try.",1
98hyK2QEUeI8v2y0AghfZA,"Saw the grand opening sign so we decided to stop in for some pho & bun bo hue.  The server was Caucasian so she looked confused & shocked when I asked if they had pork blood in their bun no hue which usually comes with authentic Vietnamese bun bo hue, but they didn't have it.  The bowl was also very small.  The broth was mediocre.  I was very disappointed.  My hubby had the super bowl pho & it didn't come with much meat or tripe that a dac biet super bowl should come with.  We came from
 CA & Dallas so we've been looking/waiting for some good Viet pho shop, but still left unsatisfied.  Suggestions for the owner:  please add soy bean milk & young coconut drink to the menu.  Please have an option to add blood to your bun bo hue & make the bowl bigger even if u have to increase the price, and please add some tripe & more meat to your super bowl or change the name to large bowl.",0

9bxcpud3GREFOxKY2cbheA,"I am from the Dayton area and was visiting the Parma area. I had dinner (and lunch) at Verso. All I can say is ""wow""! Pizza at lunch was fantastic. Dinner was even better.

I had the pleasure to meet and talk with the owners and found them to be extremely warm and friendly. They were genuinely concerned about the quality and flavor of their food. 
I would highly recommend Verso's. I will definitely return if I am back in that area.",1
9Ii0ZUKw0zAus-AnI00xLw,"I ate lunch here with clients. They said they are regulars, and since I love Mexican food, I met them there.  There were three of us in the party.

By the time I arrived, they were already eating chips and salsa which were very good.  I ordered the camarones diablos (spicy shrimps), and they were amazing.  Everything I ate was delicious with large portions.  It is very authentic Mexican food and I highly recommend it.

The service was a little slow, but nothing to get upset about.  5-stars for sure!!",1
9Ii0ZUKw0zAus-AnI00xLw,This is a fine Mexican restaurant and I don't like Mexican but the man that has his place knows how to cook also no sound and just if you don't like the food authentic Mexican food,1
9Ii0ZUKw0zAus-AnI00xLw,"Pinatas used to be Mi Pueblos years ago, and yes I had eaten some takeout dinners from Mi Pueblos, and I wasn't impressed. So when my client told me he wanted to meet me at Pinatas, I told him, hey, I know exactly where it's at !

But to be honest, I have not been a fan of Mexican food myself because I somehow don't have a taste for beans. Plus yes I do realize the importance of eating vegetables, and O that wholesome guac !!!! I got friends who will die for good guacamole, but hell yeah, I will give my best shot to eat that healthy stuff, but I won't give up my taste for good meats for some greens. I confess that, If I was a plant, I would be carnivorous one.

So the reason I was at this restaurant was not to discover some gem of Latin food, but to see if I can perhaps lay my hands on that legendary Aztec gold  through my Mexican client.  Yes, my client was a Mexican, and he generously offered to treat me even. I sensed that perhaps my sixth sense was right. My client may indeed have connections to some extra money (a tingle) if not Aztec gold. And I can't be rude to him.  So I took up the offer, and ordered ""Special Monterrey"" according to his recommendation.

Voila! Achtung! Sayonara! Muy Bien!!  I was pleasantly surprised by what followed.  I don't even know what it was that I ate then. He said it is called ""flautas' and it is authentic Mexican dish !!!

Speaking about authentic, I must blame my ignorance of Mexican food. Yes there is Chipotle, and yes I like their food too. But the flautas that I found there was a huge leap to the moon as far as my knowledge of Mexican food goes. I don't claim to be the Marco Polo of Mexican Restaurants and expand stories of my adventure. After all, I was there to see if I could put my hands on the smoldering and shiny piece of Aztec gold, and sorry to say that I haven't gotten a clue on how to get to those gold as yet, and once I do, I will generously share with everyone I know, especially with my fellow Yelpers. 

Anyway, to make the long story short, I found the service to be fast and good. The food was very fresh, flautas(that I tasted for the first time) was just amazing. The portion was huge and I could not finish it, so my plan is to go back there after a gigantic workout session and I know I can consume all that healthy greens and feel healthy. After all, Mexican food seems to be in now, so I dare say I shall return to this place definitely !!!!",1
9IJ-TE4HEcAJQkUtc1A_Vw,"I know Parallax has such good reviews, so I was expecting a little better. My friend wanted to have sushi, but I wasnt in the mood since I just had my fill on Friday at Ginko. I knew that they would have some non-sushi items, because it's a ""fusion"" restaurant, so it seemed like the perfect in-between choice. 

It's a nice fancy restaurant. Very trendy. Sat at the bar for happy hour. I started off with a ""beet-up"" martini. Sounded interesting, and I like beets, so why not give it a try? It was ok. Definitely tasted like beets to me, but not something I would get again. I appreciate the creativity, but I'll just stick to beets in my salads from now on. 

I ordered the Parallax burger, which came with a huge mound of shoe-string fries. HUGE. I barely ate them. The burger was good. Came with bacon, and a side of thousand island dressing. My friend ordered spicy tuna rolls and a pineapple-coconut mussel app. The mussels were tasty! It didn't sound too great at first, so I was pleasantly surprised. 

I got some food to-go for my other half. I ordered the potstickers and the chicken liver saute w/ dirty rice. I just tasted the rice and I thought it was a little mushy, but interesting flavor. He called it ""livery."" The potstickers were deep-fried, and filled with short-rib meat. I didn't taste these, but he wasn't a big fan. I was surprised to find that they were deep-fried because they're called POTSTICKERS for a reason, right? Because when you make them, they should be sticking to the pot, not thrown in the deep fryer! Eh, minor details. 

I know they are most known for their sushi, which the hostess said is ""really good."" But the prices are up there for sure. Ginko is a better deal and you get awesome, authentic sushi. I also noted other Japanese dishes like udon were the priciest I've ever seen....c'mon who wants to pay $20 for a bowl of rice noodles? you can get this at another Japanese restaurant for about half that. I don't think I'm inclined to return.",0
9IJ-TE4HEcAJQkUtc1A_Vw,"Went here on a busy Friday without a reservation, and I was beyond suprised to be given a table right away. The servers there were very friendly and helpful. Extensive menu that was all over the place. Very interesting to peruse. Had two separate appetizers that were both tastefully made. Additionally, we ordered a large variety of sushi and sashimi. The fish was very fresh. The rolls were well made. I would say this isnt the most authentic place, but it is very good for a date night. This place is a little on the pricey side, but I really think it's a wonderful date spot. Also save room for dessert! I had a hard time picking but was very much satisfied with dessert. Will go again when craving sushi...",1
9JUynLfWPwe1X9gsJS6FTA,"The food was great! We had a great server named Dori. She gave us really good recommendations and made sure we enjoyed our dinner. Cheddar Mashed potatoes are amazing, and the corn bread is authentically good.  If I'm in Cleveland again I'd come back for sure!",1
9LAXz_VfATZ0kLdaavkN4g,"The food and margaritas were awesome! It is a very open, hip feel. We sat next to the patio and our service was great! After asking if we had visited before and finding out we have not she went over how they use fresh, local ingredients and make their corn tortillas in house. There was three of us and we got a pitcher of margaritas, chips and gauc, and 8 tacos. Everything tasted delicious. The tacos are authentic and smaller than a normal tortilla, 3 would be good to order. Only thing was that it is a tad pricey and can increase quickly. Overall would return!",1
9LAXz_VfATZ0kLdaavkN4g,"The best food and libations in downtown Cleveland. Our server, Lauren, was wonderful and our service was excellent. Their house margarita is made with fresh sweet and sour, no cheap pre-mix. 
We sampled almost all the taco choices and guacamole. They were authentic, high quality selections. The decor and ambience is great.",1
9LAXz_VfATZ0kLdaavkN4g,"Hm so probably would rate this a high 3, maybe 3.9 so should I call it 4?  The service was interesting. A 2 for the hostess. A 3.5 for the bartender. A 4 for our waitress. The food was a 4 so better than I expected though if you factor in price, maybe equates to a 3.75. Is this being picky? Maybe.

Not sure if we got a new hostess or if their reservation system is weird. We walked in - no reservation and the place was maybe half full. We were told 15-20 mins so we went to grab a drink at the bar. We were able to order fairly quick but within that 5 minute span, our table, which was previously empty, became 'avaliable.' Now I am not trying to complain about being seated, only that it seemed a bit disorganized. It was also unfortunate because if I had known it would be so quick, we'd order drinks from the table so we could trip the waitress instead.

We got the chips/queso and then 4 various tacos. 2 each plus the drinks and chips was plenty filling for us. The flavors were decent but I honestly love the hole in the wall tacos better.  What this place lacks for in flavors, it did make up for in general decor and ambience.

This would definitely be a great and fun place to go with a group but if I'm craving cheap authentic tacos (and flying solo), I'd go elsewhere.",0
9LAXz_VfATZ0kLdaavkN4g,"Bakersfield didn't feel like an authentic experience. The decor inside feels like they were trying too hard to be trendy, and the restaurant itself attracts an older, suburban crowd. Tacos were tiny but good, but you'll need a few to get full. The tostadas are a better bang for your buck if you're looking for something to fill you up. The best part was the queso! Delicious. Unfortunately if I had to choose between here and Barrio, I would choose Barrio.",0
9LAXz_VfATZ0kLdaavkN4g,"Phenomenal Customer service. Phenomenal food. Awesome drink specials. Location is perfect. Place is clean and staff is welcoming. Manager is very nice. What more could you ask for? When I ordered I got the Milanese sandwich and it was the bomb. Will be coming back more! 

If you don't like authentic tacos this place may not be for you. They do have other food items.",1
9LAXz_VfATZ0kLdaavkN4g,"Tortillas are house made, guacamole is chunky but smooth, and the tacos are PACKED with layers of flavor! I love that they give you lime wedges on the side to spritz over any & all of your food for yet another layer of flavor. The tacos are a bit small (probably due to the authenticity of the tortilla), so I would recommend 2-3 depending on how hungry you are. I had 2 and split an appetizer of guacamole & chips- it was the perfect amount of food! If your contemplating giving this place a try- I'd definitely recommend it!",1
9LAXz_VfATZ0kLdaavkN4g,"Came here because I live in the city which this was named after. Thought it was a cute idea, nothing like the real Bakersfield, which is a good thing lol food was a trendy version of Mexican food, not authentic at all. Modern approach to cuisine, if you're looking for authentic, this is not the place. Atmosphere was chill. Really cute inside. Staff was very friendly, I really liked our server, he was funny.",1
9LAXz_VfATZ0kLdaavkN4g,"The tacos were delish, the margaritas strong, and the staff lovely.  They keep the rock n' roll pretty loud on the weekend, so don't plan on staying long, let alone relaxing. I appreciate a concise menu and a fast turn-out on the food.  I love authentic Mexican food and often abhor ""new American""-style taco permutations, but both the mushroom and the pulled brisket were tasty and filling.  The chicken was good too, if a little dry.  The house-made soft corn shells may be the best part.  Barrio has nothing on this place - leave it for the kids.  Funny that aside from the menu, absolutely nothing about this restaurant is, in fact, Mexican.   It's the owner(s) insurance for an easy re-branding if the whole Mexican thing doesn't work out.",1
9LAXz_VfATZ0kLdaavkN4g,"I kept hearing about Bakersfield and decided to give it a shot especially given that many people had only positive reviews about it.  I went with a few friends and we got a variety of tacos to all share and we also ordered the trio (chips, guacomole, rojo & verde salsas).  

For the tacos, we ordered pollo asado, fish, baja shrimp, al pastor, to name a few. The tortillas were probably one of the best parts of the taco.  They are corn tortillas made in house fresh which I really appreciated given that I actually prefer corn tortillas over flour ones.  The presentation of the tacos were beautiful and came in a huge platter family style.  

The prices are much more worth it during happy hour.  Each taco is $2 per taco which is a great price, but unfortunately, we made it only a few minutes after happy hour ended. The service was great and the waitress was very accommodating about bringing out more chips for our salsas.  We had some salsa left over and she also put that in to-go containers for us.

Overall, I wouldn't say this is the most authentic place for Mexican food, but the tacos especially during happy hour are worth every penny.",1
9LAXz_VfATZ0kLdaavkN4g,"Great place to go with friends for a variety of tacos and strong margaritas! Cleveland has an abundance of taco places but lacks ""good"" taco places. I think this fits that missing mold with tasty by no means authentic tacos - nevertheless, they really do hit the spot. Very tasty guacamole that is chunkier than usual. Pleasant atmosphere. Super close to the mainstrip of ohio city. Free parking.",1
9mI2BHTu0at_JA3RA_AEeg,"Dopey, Ball-Cap-Guy Central...

THE UP-SIDE:
Your average, everyday bar.  Booze, beer, etc.  Nice looking decor for a corner-joint.  Service is average.  The outside patio (in Summer) is a good place to hang.

THE DOWN-SIDE:
This place is consistently too noisy with music and deafening conversation levels.  In addition, it's nearly-always a ""sausage-fest;"" with big, dopey ""guy's guys"" outnumbering the women two to one.  Every once in a while, the management here attempt to resurrect an ""authentic"" Irish feel by having an Irish guy with a guitar play some songs and sing in a faux-Irish accent.  I find these times to be a truly phony and horrid little experience.

Stop in for a beer or two but don't expect anything great.",0
9p-oDNOVSG38rRN-15MviQ,I used to go to Seoul garden in Parma for Korean food but the taste there was too salty. I recently discovered this hidden gem in Chinatown and the food we ordered are very authentic and delicious! There is even a karaoke room inside the restaurant. This will be my place for Korean food in the future!,1
9p-oDNOVSG38rRN-15MviQ,"A delicious Korean restaurant! The food is (from what I understand as a non-Korean) fairly authentic and a delight! The spicy tofu was soft and spicy, while the vegetable dolsot bibimbap (rice with vegetables) came out hot in a stone bowl. As with any good Korean restaurant, complimentary cold appetizer-bites (pickled vegetables, kim chi) and white rice came with the food.

The atmosphere is bare - but saved by posters of super-cute Korean girls (beer ads) on the wall. The place itself seems to be in a run-down warehouse area. The service is OK. Bottom line - come for the food.",1
9p-oDNOVSG38rRN-15MviQ,Good and authentic korean food. A bit pricy. Their lunch menu is good.,1
9p-oDNOVSG38rRN-15MviQ,"They have great bibimbap. ...But that's the only great dish they have.
They also have quasi-Asian style karaoke, with an authentic Korean-language system and input console. 

If I were that desperate for Korean food or Asian-style karaoke in Cleveland, I might go to this family-owned Korean restaurant, but there are alternatives in town for both offerings with comparable prices and better service.


In regards to food, the dol sot (clay bowl) bibimbap is the highlight here. The jigae (soft tofu stews) are tasty, and are probably the only other dishes on the menu that aren't overpriced. The pork noodle soup, on the other hand, has been very underwhelming and unnecessarily expensive, and comes with only a single piece of pork. The small side dishes have nice variety.

Now for the karaoke. It's in a room that you have to reserve in advance. It's recommended to book for 6 or more people, because otherwise they get mad. They also get mad if you don't order dinner with karaoke, which is fair, as the karaoke is discounted with dinner (which cancels out the discount). The song selection is decent; good selection of Korean music, okay but kind of random selection of Japanese music, and limited selection of English music. Not all of the books are up to date with the most recently added tracks. There are also Chinese, Vietnamese, and other more obscure language tracks which you can only access through the Korean-language console, so either bring someone who can read Korean or prepare to memorize symbols on buttons. Of note, the video that goes along with the sound recycles through old Korean tragedy movies and is often hilariously incongruent with the music. As an extreme Asian karaoke buff, this place gets 3/5 for the karaoke.

Overall this would make for a 3-star place if not for generally bad service and the many times we've run into billing drama. The management tends to be incompetent and rather grudging when we try to divide the bill for a group, and will charge gratuity on the tax, which is shady to put it mildly. After several times arguing and leaving with glares all around, it's just not worth it to come here anymore.


As a note, Miega BBQ is several blocks down, has similar prices, a bigger menu selection, better food, better service, and free karaoke. Follow the logic.",0
9p-oDNOVSG38rRN-15MviQ,"As you walk in, you can tell that there was no money spent on design or decorations. So if you are looking for romantic ambience, this is more like a local BBQ dive. Oh, there's a karaoke room in case you are wondering who is singing horrible imitation of K-pop.

Taste is very good for the three dishes we ordered, and I'm sure other dishes may have equally authentic flavors. But portion size is rather skimpy as compared to other Korean joints. Bonchons are also slim with only half a dozen plates. They are kind of cheap on rice and soup that come with the entrees. Rice bowl was half filled and soup was barely filled half way. 

Service was fine but I dont like walking away hungry.",0

There's Korean beer posters and autographs written all over the walls and a separate room for events.

9p-oDNOVSG38rRN-15MviQ,This is such a awesome place!! I took my father and son on our recent trip to Cleveland . It was so authentic and was a great family experience. Sang our waiter made our soju cocktails with a bang. You can taste the quality of the ingredients in every bite . Highly recommend it !!!,1
9p-oDNOVSG38rRN-15MviQ,"I've had Korean Food in South Korea and Korean Food here in Cleveland, Ohio and this is still my favorite. I think Korea House is superior to Seoul Garden, Seoul Hot Pot, or Miega. 

It ranks in my top 10 favorite restaurants in Cleveland, hands down. 

1) The Restaurant itself is set in a non-discrepant red brick building on the corner of East 38th and Superior in Asia Town. Ample parking and enter where the blue awning is. 

2) The restaurant is small. There is a private room in the back for Karaoke and large groups. It's kind of awesome. It's not fancy or showy at all. Just like many authentic Asian restaurants with Mom and Son cooking in the back are. You'll see a mix of White, Asian, and sometimes Black in the restaurant at any given time. 

3) They do not have liquor here. But you can indulge in beer, wine, sake, and soju. I suggest going with a bottle of Soju for your table. 

4) Banchan: These are the tiny sides that come with everyones dinner. Kimchi, Cucumbers, Pickles, Spicy Radish, Salad, Fish Cake, Potatoes. All amazing! 

5) Appetizers: The Kimbop Rolls are amazing. This is one of my favorite Korean appetizers and this is the best one I've ever had anywhere in the world. We also shared a Haemul Panjeon Pancake (Seafood Pancake). Perfectly doughy and excellent with some dipping sauce. Finally, we got an order of Mandu (Fried Dumplings). These were okay. I think they changed their recipe or something. 

6) Dinner Entrees: Hands down the best item on the menu is the Kalbi (Korean Short Ribs). They are so tender. You will not be disappointed! We also got a Dakqui (Grilled Chicken Breast). That too was tender and had great smoky and light spicy flavor to it. Btw, we asked our waitress (Shiroko) to cut the Kalbi and the Dakqui for the table so we could share easily. We also got the Japchae Noodles. I had never had Japchae before but these noodles were fantastic. Somewhat of a different texture to them (Almost slimy) but so good with the stir fried beef, onions, peppers, sesame seeds. Our final entrÁE©e was an order of Kalbi Sal. My understanding is this is sliced ribeye that comes out raw. You are given a portable grill and cook your meat table side. Pair it down with a lettuce wrap and a spicy garnish and it's one of the best lettuce wraps I've eaten. 10/10 if you ask anyone from our group. 

It's affordable, it's no frills, but it is such a unique dining experience that you'll be sure to re",1
9p-oDNOVSG38rRN-15MviQ,"Nestled in Cleveland's Asia Town, Korea House is one of those restaurants you might not stumble into if you weren't looking for it.

The parking at Korea House is super easy and there's a free lot directly in front of the restaurant.  You'll be seated right away once inside, and they will bring you Banchan (small dishes of food) almost immediately. The menu is generous in terms of options, providing options for both vegetarians and carnivores, and no one can dispute the authenticity of this local restaurant. 

My review rounds out to 3 stars for two big reasons: portion size and ambiance. The lunch portions are very small for the price, and the restaurant is very plain in creating any type of atmosphere. They also always seemed to be understaffed given how popular they are. If you're journeying here on a lunch hour, be sure to give yourself more than one hour! Yet, if Korean food is your jam, I think you'll appreciate Korea House, regardless of wait time.",1
9p-oDNOVSG38rRN-15MviQ,"The food here is out of this world good! Ive been coming back for years now and it always impresses me and remains very authentic. I could not recommend Korea House enough, you must try it! Its truly a hidden gem and I hope to come for many years to come!",1
a1_ZedhXo5mVflOV471pCA,"Ok... let me preface this review by stating that this is not a place you plan an evening for... no dates, no groups, no hangin' out with your buddies. It's a very tiny take out joint. You walk in the door and you have about as much space as a broom closet to stand in. It's cramped, looks a bit disorganized, but folks... let's face it - we're here for the food.

Owned and operated by an authentic Filipino Lola (grandma), she and her place serves the quintessential Filipino comfort food. I say comfort because when I sit down, wherever I may be, to enjoy a meal from Mely's... I am taken ""home"". Memories flash of all the tastiest Filipino dishes made by the greatest Filipino cooks I've ever had the pleasure of being fed by. I've tried just about everything Aling Mely offers at this joint. Everything, and I mean everything is authentically good. But I have my two staples that I get just about every time I come here: 1) the oh-so-crispy lechon kawali - wok fried pork belly with the skin ever so crispy, chopped up in generous bite-sized pieces, served with Pinoy gravy. 2) The dinuguan. Oh, man! The dinuguan. I won't describe the details of this pork dish here, but if you're a fan of dinuguan, it's as good as any of the best I've had. It really is. And if you don't know what dinuguan is... just try it over rice. I promise you'll love it!",1

Mely's is so authentic, right down to the location- it's exactly where I expect to find true Filipino cuisine. They make their lumpia fresh and fry it up when you order it. The bistek is AMAZING and the lechon is delicious. I'm not a diehard lechon fan, but I will happily eat Mely's anytime! Mely is so sweet and friendly, and her dishes are full of flavor. Definitely worth visiting again and again!",1
a1_ZedhXo5mVflOV471pCA,I know very little about Filipino food but happily I stumbled on this place when I was in the area on a trip getting my car serviced. I got the Menudo from the hot table with rice. All I can say is that is was delicious and a lot of food for $7.00. Everything there had a beautifully home-cooked look about it. The hostess (I'm guessing Mely) was very sweet. Definitely don't plan to eat in here but do plan on great food to carry out.,1

a58P2BPCCbQgDMbEoLfWzg,"Five stars, to me, means close to perfection, so I don't award them lightly.  But Emperor's Palace is truly outstanding--and I didn't even know that it existed until Chinese New Year, when my Chinese friends took me there for a super-delicious meal.

Now, I had an unfair advantage, because my friends had long conversations with the servers about what goodies would be coming our way--and, of course, these conversations were in Chinese.  If my reward is food this good, I think I need to begin studying Mandarin.  A reviewer said that her order was ""dramatically different from what we know them to be.""  I think that the problem for most of us Yanks is that them there crafty Chinese habituate us to food specially crafted to our palates in most restaurants.  (My Chinese fiance would always say that Chinese food had to be ""edited"" for 'Mericans,.  It needed to be fried and oilier than normal, sweetened when it would not normally be sweetened, and cooked longer.  He was a great cook, so he had a lot of credibility.)  

And, yeah, the area is certainly ""bad.""  Those who don't spend most of their time in the CSU area, as I do, might want to make the first visit during daylight hours.  There is no parking lot.  We had no trouble finding parking, though, although the restaurant was crowded--Chinese New Year, remember?  Oh, and there are cool statues of Chinese zodiac animals lining the street.  Oh, and the interior is GORGEOUS.  

I recommended the restaurant to all my friends, regardless of national origin.  I haven't had the opportunity to eat there again, but I am eager to do so.  My opinion:  well worth a try, if you like authentic, tasty Chinese food.  (Obviously I do!)",1
a58P2BPCCbQgDMbEoLfWzg,"When this place first opened, it took 7 to 10 minutes for the dim sum to get to the table, since they were making it fresh!

You can't miss this place there are 12 stone statues of the animals of the Chinese zodiac out in front of the parking lot. The interior is authentic and design of the inside is beautiful.

The location is near downtown neatly tucked away from a main road.  It appears as if the entire lower half of this building was completely renovated and it is beautiful Asian dÁE©cor..""It feels like visiting a palace quite literally.  Golden lined doors and walls, artistic wood carvings and the like; one definitely feels they are in a far far away place.  
However majestic it may look, you are probably asking about the food right?  I will tell you that this does not disappoint.  I picked up 2 lunches today, one for me now, and one for my lover as a dinner.  
I ended up going with the Orange Tofu and Healthy Rice....I am not certain how one creates the orange glaze that we have here, but such a citrus flavor wrapped around tofu with a perfect spice...mm mm give me more!!!!.  It is refreshing to be offered ""healthy rice"" opposed to simply Fried or White rice.  I enjoy the grains!..

a58P2BPCCbQgDMbEoLfWzg,"A party of 4 of us wanted to try some place new in Cleveland for dim sum and heard about Emperor's Palace located in the old Chinatown area. 

The restaurant was easy to find, with plenty of parking in the lot across the street from the building. The lot is very distinctive because there are 12 stone statues of animals standing guard facing the restaurant. These are the 12 Chinese zodiac animals, a very nice landmark.

We were very impressed with the decor inside the restaurant. It is ornately decorated with gold and other Chinese trimmings. The staff was very friendly and quite knowledgeable about  the menu too. Our drinks were kept filled (hot tea and iced water) and the dim sum dishes we ordered were delivered to our table piping hot.

Compared to other dim sum places in Cleveland, the food here was head and shoulders above the rest. The portions were larger, the temperature was good (we know it had not been sitting in a cart cooling down), and the taste was more flavorful. The Phoenix Claws we had were plump and not overcooked. The Turnip Cake was thick and crispy on the outside. The riblets in black bean sauce were tasty morsels of deliciousness. We had two pastry dishes, both which were excellent. The pastry was flaky and light while the filling was savory and hot.

While this restaurant's dim sum selection is quite large, we would have liked it if they had a couple of items we liked at the other large dim sum place. Unfortunately, the Emperor's Palace did not serve fried sticky rice or our favorite dessert, ""tau foo fah"". Even then, I would not hesitate to return to this restaurant for some excellent and authentic dim sum!",1

a58P2BPCCbQgDMbEoLfWzg,"So we found out about this because of the Cleveland Night Market.  We went back on a regular night.  The inside is fairly authentic.  The service is really great.  The menu will take the normal American a little off guard.  They have most of what one would be normally used to but they they have the truly traditional dishes.  Not quite brave enough just yet but working on it.

The servings are huge, so be careful.  My favorite of the night was crispy garlic beef.  We also had spring rolls and crab Rangoon.  Others had General Taos and an Orange Chicken.  All were fantastic.

So my one really big surprise, the deserts.  They gave us a sampling of an egg tart and some other sponge cake.  They were amazing.  I have had pastries in China towns in NY and Chicago.  Bit pretty much the same and very bland.  These were not.  A must have.",1
a58P2BPCCbQgDMbEoLfWzg,"Super old school Chinese. Dim sum was limited but good. Very authentic.  It's BYOB So grab some beer, saki and a few friends have a fun night out with great food in a kitschy environment.",1
a58P2BPCCbQgDMbEoLfWzg,"Emperors serve great Cantonese food. Yes I specially recommended this place for Businesses or dating. The decoration are very classy and elegant. I  offer authentic cantonese Dim Sum. More healthier, tasty, and the texture is correct. I can tell just because I am a Chinese  grow up in Hong Kong.  I am a picky eater!",1
a58P2BPCCbQgDMbEoLfWzg,Very authentic food. Atmosphere was too lit up.   Parking was easy. Dim sum was excellent.,1
a58P2BPCCbQgDMbEoLfWzg,"definitely a good place for 'dim sum'. :)
as far as i know this is the only place that offers pretty authentic 'dim sum' menu and the other foods on the menu are very nice too.
it's a little hard to find this place at first but after the first time, i've been going there like 3 times a week now!",1
a58P2BPCCbQgDMbEoLfWzg,"I was at Emperor's Palace first for dim sum brunch with friends about three weeks after it's opening.  This was very good and there is a central buffet area where you can pick the dishes you like and a server will bring it to you.  The shrimp dumplings (har kow) were a little dry but the rest of the dim sum was great and very authentic.  Food was flavorful and not overly greasy.  The sticky rice in lotus leaves, chicken feet, tripe, steamed beef meatballs, and pot stickers were delicious.  The jellyfish was also great.

I went back later in the week for take out dinner after a late meeting and ordered the Szechuan tofu and the Hunan shrimp.  The Szechuan tofu had those wonderful mouth numbing peppercorns in the sauce and the Hunan shrimp was flavorful with fresh vegetables.  I ordered the spice level at medium hot which was perfect for me.
It came with a choice of steamed jasmine rice or ""healthy rice,"" a mix of some jasmine and wild and brown rice.  I tried the ""healthy rice"" and found it quite tasty and will probably have it again.
 
The menu is large and has many authentic dishes.  I speak Cantonese so ordering food is pretty easy, but the managers speak English very well and remembered me from my first visit.  Overall, very good customer service, great food quality.  

I would give this restaurant 5 stars, but my only drawback is its location, especially at night.  Rockwell is a bit isolated from the other restaurants and businesses at night and there are some occasional individuals requesting handouts as you go toward your car.  I feel safe, but I think this may turn some people off.",1
a58P2BPCCbQgDMbEoLfWzg,"Great dim sum spot. 

The place is ladened with gold from top to bottom. 

The dishes were already steamed and ready to be served on this Saturday afternoon; the food were superrr fresh and authentic. I judge dim sum on the quality of Asianness. The beef balls were so springy -- so on pointe. I also recommend the shrimp dumpling har gow, pork dumpling siu mai, shrimp noodle crepe roll cheung fun, beef balls ngao yuk, and phoenix claws chicken feet.

I also had to have my honey walnut shrimp -- excellent quality made HK style.

This is located in Old Chinatown",1
a58P2BPCCbQgDMbEoLfWzg,"Highly recommend this place if you want to try authentic Chinese food, not American Chinese Food! I just moved to Cleveland this April from China. Looking for great Chinese food is one of my big interest here. However, Yelp rate didn't really help to tell the authentic Chinese food. This restaurant definitely deserves 5 star in terms of food quality! The Dim Sun is so good and reminds my time in Hong Kong. Quality of food is consistent and not using heavy sauces. It is even better that most Chinese Restaurant with higher rate in NYC! I will definitely go to this place on a regular base, and highly recommend it to my home sick Chinese Friends.",1

A7i_H252XydtrK7BUTvoog,"Brunch Review

A serious lack of identity. They say they are a southern/soul style restaurant but I am not feeling the authenticity. 

Food: 2 stars.
Their signature Louisiana Quiche was a little above average but their ""Cajun potatoes"" had no kick and no Cajun taste. 

Service: 1 star.
Lack of urgency and attentiveness. Lack of training and flexibility. No real support staff structure. It seemed like employees were just wondering around without a designated function and accountability.

Vibe: 1 star. Lack of identity and real, southern soul feel. 

Price: Louisiana Quiche and coffee cost $18. Enough said. 

Would not recommend.",0
A7i_H252XydtrK7BUTvoog,"Two things to judge a southern style restaurant by:  biscuits and grits. I just had Saturday brunch consisting of eggs, pepper bacon, grits, fried green tomatoes and biscuit. Right on the money. The grits were authentic and I know, having grown up in SC and Mississippi. They were creamy, cooked right (not too much and not too little), and seasoned nicely. And the biscuit - light, fluffy and tasty, no butter or jelly or honey to mask a gummy biscuit or a stale puck.   Overall it's good. Just like the sister restaurants.",1
AbPQf-X7awuPFDULiJ43bg,This place is affordable and authentic! Their banh mi was very delicious and pho was always super flavorful. Strongly suggest the pho with all kinds of meat in it - that's my favorite. I heard their papaya salad was pretty delicious too!,1
AbPQf-X7awuPFDULiJ43bg,"Superior Pho in one word is ""underwhelming"".  I'm surprised this place has so many great reviews.  Maybe it's because I'm from a traditional background and i was expecting traditional pho but I was disappointed in their food and service.  The place is small, although they did expand.  It's crowded, cleanliness is questionable and they seem quite hectic and disorganized during busy times.  The broth soup for their pho is bland, and seems like it's a bit watered down.  They skimp on giving you the portions of meat with the pho.  Their ""meatballs"" were cut into 4ths to be served...seriously?  Seems like their food has been ""americanized"" which I guess is fine, but doesn't sit well with me since I'm expecting authentic ethnic food no matter the culture.  There numerous better alternatives to Superior Pho with superior food (no pun intended), ambiance and service.",0
AbPQf-X7awuPFDULiJ43bg,"Best place for authentic Pho in Cleveland! I always get the #8 large with eye-round steak and I can never eat it all.

AbPQf-X7awuPFDULiJ43bg,"Having lived in San Francisco and experienced authentic Vietnamese cuisine in several family run restaurants there, the popular Superior Pho is not the most authentic Vietnamese restaurant in NE Ohio.

Their Pho is just OK - generous portions but more noodles than I prefer and a bit too salty. Their summer rolls were below average - being a bit mushy to the touch, and were not freshly prepared, but served chilled (not room temp), as if they were sitting in the refrig already premade. And their peanut sauce is inconsistent - sometimes thick and tasty, other times runny and too spicy. Their Vietnamese sandwich - Banh Mi - seemed a bit small in size and lacking in meat quantity, though the bread was a nice crusty texture. The staff is friendly, but the restaurant is often not that clean with sticky and poorly wiped table surfaces, and obvious food particles on the floor/under table and chairs. Prices are average.

I have been coming here for several years now, and the quality has definitely declined. It is now very popular and I think that quality control has suffered a lot.
Luckily, for those seeking authentic, quality, fresh Vietnamese cuisine, try the new PHO HA NAM located in the Asian Town Center just a few blocks away on Superior.
This family run restaurant is now the most authentic and quality focused Vietnamese restaurant in NE Ohio. Check it out, you won't be disappointed!

AbPQf-X7awuPFDULiJ43bg,"Great vietnamese, don't bother going next door to number 1 pho.  Most authentic in the area.",1
AbPQf-X7awuPFDULiJ43bg,"So visiting Ohio I saw on Yelp the good reviews this place had.  As a Vietnamese individual from California (who grew up eating some of the best pho ever) and currently living in NY (home of some quite disappointing pho fare) I had to stop here to give this place a go.  Some of the best pho people have ever eaten, huh?  Let's see.

First off, this place is not directly on Superior Street.  It's in some sort of shady mall location in the back.  Don't be misled and go to that Pho #1 location by accident unless you intended to go to Pho #1.

I ordered a #10 which got me 1 large bowl of pho (I ordered the Dac Biet which is the Special) and a Vietnamese Banh Mi (Sandwich) and a drink (wished they gave the option of Vietnamese iced coffee as a drink which they don't).  Ok so the pho.  Simply put the meat used were great.  Some of the best beef I've had in awhile in a pho dish.  And they probably used a professional slicing machine for the tripe.  Some of the thinnest slicest of tripe I've ever encountered.  Thumbs up. The broth, however, was lacking.  While not watery, I didn't feel it was flavorful enough.  Just my opinion.  My comrades felt there was too much of a ginger taste with the broth.  Also, there were not tendon in my pho.  What's up with that?  I did order a Dac Biet after all.

On to the sandwich.  Sorry, it's not authentic.  I am one of the folks who's a big believer in the actual bread being of equal importance as what's inside it.  While the filing was good enough the bread used...I'm not sure what that was. My friend and I bought ordered the #10 so I'm sure they used the same loaf of bread for each of us and just ripped it in half for each.  It looked like an italian bread ripped in half.  Disappointment.

I wished I could give at least a 3.5 star for this place because hey Cleveland you beat New York with your pho.",0
AbPQf-X7awuPFDULiJ43bg,"This place had a bunch of good reviews, so I wanted to try it out. It is nestled in a little Asian center that has a few other food vendors. The restaurant itself is very cozy and pretty spacious with its two rooms. Staff were also pretty friendly.

As for the food, I was not very pleased. I had the goi cuon (summer roll) and the bun bo hue.. Both were sub-par. The summer roll looked like it was quickly thrown together and tasted just ok. The bun no hue was not very flavorful and it did not taste like traditional bun bo hue at all... It was very garlic-strong. Probably my worst experience of having bun no hue in a restaurant. I tried my boyfriend's pho and banh mi.. The banh mi was probably the best tasting out of everything (great bread!) and the pho was just ok, a bit bland. 

However this place seems to be popular with locals and families of non-Vietnamese decent. I will reiterate that the food wasn't terrible but it was just not authentic tasting (coming from a Vietnamese person). I personally was not pleased.",0
AbPQf-X7awuPFDULiJ43bg,"I came in here for a Mother's Day brunch and I could not believe how the owner was treating his employees. I could hear the yelling blaring from the kitchen and our server running out of the restaurant crying. 
The food was mediocre at best. The grilled pork on the 3C seemed like it was microwaved and served on a cold bed of hard rice. I also received cold spring rolls which seemed to be undercooked. The meal was very  disappointing... the service was prompt and friendly so sad to see our server ran out crying her eyes out. Do yourself a favor and don't go here. If you're trying to get some authentic Vietnamese food this is NOT the place to go. I will never be back here again.",0
AbPQf-X7awuPFDULiJ43bg,"Best Pho in town! They have many pho options to choose from and they are all amazing and super authentic. The portion sizes are very large, which is great, you can eat it all or have a great amount for leftovers! They give you a bunch of accompaniments, too! My go to is the #8, great variations of the meats. The #2 is also delicious and the most authentic (as you cook the raw beef in the broth). 

We also got the ""7C bahn mi"" which was SO delicious too, even the bread was the perfect crisp on the outside, soft on the inside. 

We went here twice in one week - once on a Saturday night, which they were pretty busy but still their service was quick. Their take out is also super quick and professional! They give you all the necessary accompaniments and package smartly. 

Definitely recommend - our go-to pho spot! A great bang for your buck as you can swing 2 meals out of it. Parking is in back.",1
AbPQf-X7awuPFDULiJ43bg,Maybe I am comparing this place to California but the food here is really not good. I got the Bun bo hue and there was just a few slices of beef shank. The soup base is bland. Too much noodle which is not edible. Don't expect anything authentic. It takes forever to pay the bill at the cashier. Sorely disappointing,0
AbPQf-X7awuPFDULiJ43bg,"I don't get it. They may be going for authentic and quaint but this place is filthy. I can only imagine what goes on in the kitchen. And after all of the great reviews I was expecting much better food. It's average at best. The only redeeming virtue was the attentive waitstaff.


Hi Chris...To answer your question below, the floors are incredibly dirty. It was disgusting. I wondered if that was why you kept it so dimly lit in there. There are marks all over your walls. Just look at the back one as an example. I feel if you can't keep your dining room clean, how could we ever expect your kitchen to be clean?

I had heard so much good things about your restaurant that I was shocked when I walked in there for the first time.

Best regards,

Mark",0

AbPQf-X7awuPFDULiJ43bg,"Soup, Salad, Banhwich to go.  (uh-oh....)

Thanks to most of the reviewers who put me into the ""can't wait to taste that stuff"" zone, I finally made it here.  It all began with a friendly, helpful girl who took my order.  I told her that it was my first time there, that I'd never eaten Vietnamese foods, and that I was really looking forward to trying these dishes.

COMBINATION MEAL 2  

GOI GA  * * * * *  Chicken Cabbage salad; deliciously vinegary-sweet thin (like water) dressing over very finely-shredded cabbage, with cilantro additions resulting in that herb as the dominant flavor.   A few small pieces of mild tender chicken breast complemented the pleasant crunchy sharpness. 

#3 PHO TAI CHIN  * * *    Well-done Brisket and raw Eye of Round Steak, both shaved and in very generous amounts (but with too much fat and gristle that I had to trim off the dry, lacking-in-flavor Brisket), lots of crunchy bean sprouts, a few slices of onion and mild green pepper, many leafy sprigs of I'm-not-sure-what-but-tasted-wonderful (probably a form of basil), and a little tub of a hot saucy mixture---maybe a sesame/hoisin mix---but alas, no noodles.  Their site says Pho contains noodles.  Looked forward to that, but still satisfying without.  Obvious---but mild---cinnamon-flavored broth, that once other ingredients are added as you eat, begins taking on the beef and herb flavors.  I wouldn't mind a big pot of this type of broth---to dip a ladle into over 2 or 3 days---with all those delicious additions.  I'm going to do a little kitchen experimentation.  I have a wonderful beef broth recipe that might soon be going through a little Asian Transformation.  (Hmm---TransformAsian.  Just made that up, but it's probably been floating through the universe for decades.)   And I won't forget the noodles.  (FYI:  For newies like me, PHO is pronounced FUH, as in DUH.  Searched it a year ago, and it's taken me this long to visit a Pho spot.) 

CHOICE OF BEVERAGE  *   Jasmine iced tea was way too weak---delicious but too faint a flavor---and as close to plain water as you can get.  Needed another 5 minutes steeping or more tea to water ratio.
.

The ""7C"" style, BANH MI THIT  * *  

Good crusty French Bread hoagie-style, with roasted pork, cucumber, homemade pate, mayonnaise sauce, and fresh herbs---maybe daikon, too.  Very little pork, however---looking nothing at all like the photo on their site showing a good amount of meat.  Mine had a very light-handed fill, and almost as much fat as pork---thinly-sliced into long narrow strips.  (Fat was never mentioned as one of the ingredients on their menu description, but there sure was enough of it.)  Since this was my first ever banh mi, I don't know if this is the authentic way that it's prepared and served, but was willing to try as is.  ""When in Rome"" lasted about 2 bites before I performed the final trimming----and ended up with a reasonably-sized pile of fat, at that.  It was a disappointment---not enough flavor or ingredients, and not enough of the good parts.  Plus, the two very faint smears of pate and mayonnaise lent no discernible flavor to this sandwich.   I'd read about Banh Mi's years ago, so at least I was able to finally try one.  Really liked the idea---the combination of these elements.  With this visit, I've found another new way to use my leftover roasted pork---I'll just add these other ingredients and make my own.  Done.
 
.
I want to believe that I was noodle-deprived and pork/pate short-changed by accident.  I'll just about always give the benefit of the doubt in matters like this, although it was a slow (from all appearances) Sunday afternoon and was nearly empty---counted only 5 diner-heads.  Mondays they're closed.  Maybe they'd run out of prepared ingredients---namely noodles, pork, and pate---but I don't want to go there.  Even the best laid plans....   If I ever go back---I'm still deliberating on that possibility---I'll eat in.  Or I might try other Vietnamese spots to compare these dishes and confirm authenticity. 

Now, it could be my inter-galactic experience manuevering through swirling space debris, dwarfs, and all that other stuff, but I had no problem finding this joint.  I pulled right in like I was pulling into my own driveway.  I took the interbelt north, turned off and up the Superior exit ramp, made a sharp right turn halfway up, came to a stop sign, crossed a side street, continued straight onto an open alleyway, and there was the building's rear entrance at my left.  Appeared to have parking for 20-30 cars---for at least the two restaurants here, and perhaps other businesses, too.  Click on the Google map on Yelps Superior Pho's page, choose Satellite view and click + and -- to get a feel for where it's located.

My recommendation:  
Pull up their site for complete menu and descriptions so you know what to expect.

AbPQf-X7awuPFDULiJ43bg,"Yesss! We love Superior Pho- as close to authentic as you can get around these parts. I'm always a big fan of the 2 or 3 pho bowls. Tonight, I tried the chicken pho for the first time and it was so delicious. Ask for a side of chili paste with whatever you order- it's so good. The hot jasmine tea is another one of my favorites here.",1
AbPQf-X7awuPFDULiJ43bg,"I was really looking forward to this place because I had heard si many good things about it. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. I grew up on Vietnamese food and prepare it myself, but the restaurant used some low quality ingredients . I ordered the traditional pho for my kids and bun Bo hue for myself. I also ordered a lychee bubble tea and summer roll. The bubble tea wasn't bad, it was the slushy kind instead if the milky kind that I like better. The summer roll was okay but their peanut sauce was thin and not very flavorful. It wasn't rolled very well. As soon the soups arrived, I smelled a particular msg- loaded spice package that is often substituted for more authentic spices and seasoning. I couldn't tell if it was the bun Bo hue or the pho,so tasted both broths and it was in both. The bun Bo hue was not spicy or lemongrass- sy, and was extremely thin, the coloring was almost clear, no pigs blood. I had to add more fish sauce and all the jalapeqos ( which you don't do with this dish) to get some heat. The noodle portion was really small. I would not call this bun bo hue because it had almost none of the traditional elements found in it. The pho was a better, but also very one dimensional tasting and I could taste some if the cheap pre- packaged seasoning in it. They definitely skimped on the anise, clove, onion, and ginger flavoring that is characteristic of more complex, flavorful broths. The noodle portion was better and was splittable between my two kids. But neither of my kids finished it, which is a definite sign that they have had better. Because I wanted to try a wide variety, I ordered the broken rice and banh mi to go. My husband didn't think highly of the broken rice and the banh mi was not great. The bread did not have the right crispiness in the outside and chewiness on the inside, and the meat was some sort of mystery meat I had never tasted and made the bread mushy. No jalapeqos. Overall, not the worst I've had but I won't be coming back",0
AbPQf-X7awuPFDULiJ43bg,"Looking for a hot bowl of savory pho? Or banh mi or Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk? Whichever delicacy you seek, Superior Pho has it.

Vietnamese restaurants are relatively rare in Cleveland, and though many pho and other Asian noodle dish places continue to pop up, if you're looking for the best Vietnamese cuisine Northeast Ohio offers, look no further! 

Located at E. 30th and Superior, Superior Pho is primely nestled among the some of downtown's best Asian restaurants and markets. Though the neighborhood isn't the greatest, parking to Superior Pho is very accessible (behind the building on Superior), and the staff is more than willing to chase away any suspect characters that may be lingering behind the building (no joke).

As for the food, no other Vietnamese restaurant seems to top the quality and affordability offered by Superior Pho. For just $6.95 you can treat your taste buds to a piping hot bowl of savory pho. (Pronounced ""fuh,"" as in ""fun."") As is standard, each bowl comes complete with additional accessories -- bean sprouts, mint leaves, lime, hot sauce, and your choice of meat, if wanted.

Having been introduced to authentic pho at one of our nation's Vietnamese cultural capitals, New Orleans, Louisiana, where many Vietnamese political refugees were transplanted during the Vietnam Conflict, I was a bit skeptical about how good Cleveland pho could be. (Interesting tidbit: take a trip out into the countryside of New Orleans East and be amazed at what you see -- modern settlements and farms that have striking resemblance to contemporary Vietnamese countryside, rice paddies. Its a cultural gem.) Though Cleveland's more recent Americanized pho pop-ups and even Pho #1, which is located next to Superior Pho, have disappointed in comparison to Nola pho, Superior's dish has presented itself as a true outlier -- and one of uncanny quality. Indeed it is difficult to directly compare when so far from Nola, yet after just my fifth bowl of Superior pho, it's sincerely hard not to admit that this Cleveland dish is indeed ""superior"" to any pho I've ever tasted. It's just so savory, and no one sip of broth or bite of noodle tastes identical to another. Each sip explodes with clues of wonderfully competing favors.

Grade: A+, because this place is just too much PHO-N",1
AbPQf-X7awuPFDULiJ43bg,"Not that I've tried tons of Vietnamese, but the pho was pretty much all I imagined it would be. I had the #13 (I believe) lunch special with ph tÁE¡i chÁE­n - pho with brisket and steak - and it was delicious. Served with a side of fresh bean sprouts, jalapenos (or maybe serranos), and mint. The broth was already seasoned well and delicious, and had some scallions already in it along with the meat. I also got an orde",1
AbPQf-X7awuPFDULiJ43bg,"By far the most authentic tasting pho I've had ever in my life. Mind you I've had pho since I was little in Colorado's ""Asian town"" area, which was good, but never THIS good. I've had pho in Wyoming which was terrible, and pho in Texas which was ok. HOWEVER, Superior Pho knows exactly what they're doing because this was by far the most delicious bowl of pho I've ever tasted. Even my husband who is newer to pho and usually is turned off by it, LOVED this place too. We will definitely be back for more when we're in the area. Even thinking about it now makes me crave it's deliciousness, the broth is on point, the noodles were not soggy, and the meat was both tender and delicious. I loved the meat to noodle portions because they were a perfect amount. Honestly what drew me here was the pictures, when I saw how the pho looked I had an instinctive feeling it was going to be tasty, I didn't realize it would be mind blowing though! Please never change!!",1
AbPQf-X7awuPFDULiJ43bg,"Wow. This place is good. Really good. I've heard about Superior Pho from celebrity chefs Alton Brown and Michael Symon. I feel bad for doubting them. I mean, how good can Vietnamese food be in Cleveland, Ohio? I am surrounded by authentic Vietnamese restaurants in Los Angeles, so I never thought it would be worth it to give this place a try. I am so glad that I recently did during my last trip to Cleveland! This place is located in a little strip mall in Asiatown, near the corner of 30th and Superior. You can easily miss this place if you aren't actively looking for it. The interior of the restaurant is pretty minimalist. The menu offers plenty of Vietnamese specialties, but they are most known for their pho. So, I ordered the pho ga, which features white meat chicken as the protein component of the soup. This soup is phenomenal. All of the other pho I've had in my life pales in comparison to this. I think what makes this stand out is the broth. It is so flavorful, complex and comforting. The noodles and chicken are also delicious and the soup is served with the traditional accouterments on the side. The prices are very fair, and in my mind a bargain. For just under $8 you get a ginormous bowl of soup. They label this bowl as ""small"". I don't know how big the large bowl is, but the small bowl is definitely more than enough for one person! So, in short, believe the hype. This place is absolutely amazing. Always trust Alton Brown and Michael Symon for restaurant recommendations. And, lastly, I'm sorry for underestimating Cleveland's ability to produce authentic Vietnamese food!",1
AbPQf-X7awuPFDULiJ43bg,"I would say, I've never had tasty authentic Pho until I had one here at Supeior Pho. The clear soup has such great aroma and intense broth taste, and the eye round beef are so tender. There are about 10 different types of Pho on the menu. I asked the waiter which one is the most common and popular and he said ""Pho tai"" with eye-round steak. The second time, I ordered ""Pho tai chin"" which is a mix of eye-round steak and beef brisket. I think I liked the second one because I get to eat two different kind, tasty beef. 
The bean sprout, mint, jalapeno which comes with Pho are very fresh. Pho large size was way too big for my boyfriend, we could share it. 
Small size would be enough for women and some men too. 

Grilled Shrimp on a broken rice dish is very good for $9. The shrimp is well seasoned/marinated and the dish comes with some lettuce, cucumber and carrots. Everytime we dine there, the service is super fast and we don't have to wait 5 mins til we start eating. 

The only thing which can be a problem about this place is that there are always more than 2, 3 flies in the restraunt.

This neighborhood used to be unfamiliar to me but now I have discovered Supeior Pho, it will be fun to shop at nearby chinese markets and shop smart &wise (For example tomatos on vine $1/2 lbs, live Blue crab for $5.99/lb). I really like to eat tasty food for lunch and dinner under $10. This is the place! I cannot wait to visit Supeior Pho and try out something new from their menu next time!",1
AbPQf-X7awuPFDULiJ43bg,After spending years in a Chicago it has been difficult to find delicious authentic pho and Banh mi.  Superior grill was delicious and it's located in a charming spot.  Tried Saigon grill weeks prior and was extremely disappointed.  They don't make authentic Banh mi. To be frank it was dry and the meat tasted off.  I highly recommend this place if you love good Vietnamese cuisine.  Great friendly service too.,1
AbPQf-X7awuPFDULiJ43bg,"Growing up, I could eat three bowls of pho a day- nothing could beat mom's pho. So naturally, when I moved up to Cleveland I was in search of a pho that could rival the freshness of home-cooked pho. I typically go to Superior Pho on gloomy Cleveland days where a nice warm bowl of pho can lift my spirits. I opt for the summer roll and small bowl of Pho (#2). The cuts of beef could be more tender and the broth felt a little heavy and lacked the accents of cinnamon, star anise, and other intricate spices. But I'm not going to complain. The summer rolls are always a great starter. The small Pho is a hearty serving and nothing can beat the speediness of the service at Superior Pho. 

Superior Pho fell just short of a fantastic Vietnamese meal, because nothing can beat watching your mom nurture Pho broth for five hours. Superior Pho is good, solid Pho.",1
AbPQf-X7awuPFDULiJ43bg,Best pho in Cleveland hands down. This is not the best pho you will ever have if you have had authentic pho around the world. But this place has a light broth that satisfies your pho cravings! The service is super fast in a tiny restaurant in Cleveland's Asia town.  I have gone here many times and have never needed to wait long for a table. 10/10 my go to place for pho in Cleveland.,1
AbPQf-X7awuPFDULiJ43bg,"When we moved from Cleveland last summer, one of things I knew I was going to miss most was the food at Superior Pho.  As a Southern California native, finding authentic and DELICIOUS Asian cuisine in Northeast Ohio was certainly a challenge!  

My favorite thing to order (besides their amazing selection of pho) is the Vietnamese sandwich with a side of shredded cabbage and chicken salad.  At the end of the meal, I always walked out of there with a boba in hand.  There's always room for bubble tea!

Superior Pho is definitely a ""hole-in-the-wall"" worth raving about!  Service is fast and food is FRESH.  I have never had a bad meal here.   This is one of Cleveland's best kept secrets but I know word is getting out because of positive reviews written here on Yelp.  

I miss Superior Pho!",1
AbPQf-X7awuPFDULiJ43bg,"Nothing is better than waking up in a lazy holiday/weekends and have Pho as brunch. Superior Pho is definitely the best Pho in Northeast Ohio. The broth is authentic and flavorful. Not like other Pho places in Cleveland which the soup is full of MSG, you can taste the herb and beef bone soup base blend together. It's comfort food. It's noodle soup lover's best choice !",1
AbPQf-X7awuPFDULiJ43bg,Best!!! From the broth to the noodles to everything in between... authentic and delicious. Even leaving a review now is making my mouth water and stomach gurgle. The Vietnamese drip coffee is a great pick me up as well as the bubble teas. Yum. Yum. Yum!!!,1
AbPQf-X7awuPFDULiJ43bg,"I hate to give this place 2 stars because the service was friendly. BUT the food was meh. I'm not Vietnamese, but I am a SoCal native and have had a good share of decently authentic Vietnamese food (not to mention I visited Vietnam this past summer)

Came with a friend and ordered pho and bunbohue. The pho broth was watery and missing the rather subtle rich flavor that makes it so good. Bunbohue had a similar problem - soup was too bland and didn't have that flavorful kick that makes it so addicting. 

As stated above, the service was good and friendly. But besides that this place is a no-go.",0
AbPQf-X7awuPFDULiJ43bg,"The best place for pho in CLE hands down! My Vietnamese friends agree that Superior Pho has the most authentic and tasty pho around, so it must be true! I come here often when I'm craving some good noodle soup. 

The restaurant has a great combo option where you can get large or small bowls of pho- your choice, with a drink or spring/summer rolls. There's even a big combo option that allows you to get a large pho, banh mi (Vietnamese sandwich), and a drink for a fairly decent price. My new favorite item to get there is the Bun bo hue soup. It's a beef noodle soup mixed in with delicious spices, and definitely worth a try! Another must have is the Vietnamese iced coffee! That stuff is so addictive! The coffee slowly drips and once it's completed, you add it to the glass with condensed milk and ice. The papaya salad with pork jerky is refreshing and sweet, perfect for a warm day. As for rice dishes, I've had the grilled marinated pork on broken rice, the curry beef on rice and I've also tried the Bo luc lac...all of which are great!! I will be back for sure Superior Pho!",1
AbPQf-X7awuPFDULiJ43bg,"Can't believe I never review this place even though I've been here for like a bazillion times within 2 years. Definitely one of the best pho places in the greater Cleveland area. Although their location/decoration could make a first-time eater have some doubts, but please don't judge until you've tried their food.
For appetizers, try their summer roll or their chicken salad. Both are pretty tasty. As for their main course, usually I go for their pho. My personal favorite is their number 12 pho - include EVERYTHING. But they have a pretty decent selection of different type of phos. Oh and their vietnamese sandwiches are very authentic too. They also serve vermicelli, and rice dishes, they're not bad, but I prefer their pho more. If you're hungry, try the combination meal which includes a variety of things. Trust me you'll be VERY full by the end. Overall, this place is definitely comparable to some NY/Brooklyn pho places.
Another great thing about this place is the speed of service. For the price you get, I can't complain. Let's just say that even though this place is about a 30min drive for me, I would come back anytime just for a nice hot bow of noodle soup!",1
AbPQf-X7awuPFDULiJ43bg,"Chibbidy JEAAA

This is my favorite Vietnamese place in Cleveland. Granted, I am not well versed in ""real"" Vietnamese food ... and I have been roundly told by Vietnamese buddies that this place is not authentic. .. however...

You never forget your first banh mi. And I'm lucky I had it here because here it is amazing. Sure, quality may vary from day to day. But when it's right it's the beeest. Crisp, crunchy/soft inside baguette, surprising cilantro and peppers, deliciously different pickled veggies, kick ass meats  = best sandwich ever.

The parents and I prefer this place for the more flavorful, but not too oily broth. They have combo meals, so you can sneak in banh mi and crunchy rolls and a ""small"" (read: plenty) pho all together. 

The cabbage and chicken salad isn't as good here as it is next door, and the place is dim with eh decor but hey. That's not why you're going.

Service is always friendly and pretty prompt in my experience.

Pho yes.",1
AbPQf-X7awuPFDULiJ43bg,"Thus is the best place in Cleveland to get pho hands down. In my opinion it is better than the place that is right next to it.  The soup is authentic tasting and the noodles and meat are done right. The food is also pretty cheap. 

When you go, you definitely want to make sire that you get the sandwich because it is seriously one of the best tasting sandwiches that you will ever find. They do an amazing job toasting the sandwich and it comes out looking delectable.

One thing to note is that this place is CLOSED on Mondays.",1

AbPQf-X7awuPFDULiJ43bg,"This was my first time here and I chose this place because of all the yelp reviews. I would never go here. I am vietnamese and I know for a fact it isnt authentic. All the dishes that I tried, I can make it better. For example, summer rolls should have vermicelli noodles, lettuce, beansprouts, cilantro, pork, and shrimp. I understand places make it different but it should be authentic. And the peanut sauce was gross. All you need is a peanut butter, hoisen sauce, and water in a saucepot on low heat. There is nothing here that would make me want to cime back.",0
AbPQf-X7awuPFDULiJ43bg,"When you say you want Pho in the Cleveland area, Superior Pho is the place to go.  I've eaten pho at just about every Asian restaurant that serves it, and there isn't anyone else that compares.  The portions are great for the price, and the authentic broth can't be found anywhere else.  Eat Superior Pho or BUST.

2nd runner up, Minh Ahn on Detroit Ave. ;-)",1
AbPQf-X7awuPFDULiJ43bg,"THE GOOD: 
Hands down, best authentic Pho in town.

THE BAD: 
Spring rolls are on the mushier side.  Sometimes the vermicelli gets a little overcooked.  And sometimes (GASP) they run out of limes, so bring your own stash if you're a diehard Pho fan like me who wouldn't survive without all the requisite fixins.

THE EVEN BETTER:  
The 3B combo under the BÁEºn dishes is a guaranteed winner even for those new to Vietnamese food.  Their grilled marinated pork has just the perfect amount of sweet, salty, smoky and tender most carnivores dream of in the ideal meat morsel.  They make a mean taro boba tea shake, which is only my most favorite non-alcoholic beverage in the whole wide worl""  And best of all, service is ÁE¼ber fast.  As in breakneck fast.  As in, for what you get, it doesn't seem humanly possible to produce the kind of made-in-your-Southeast-Asian-grandma's-kitchen-over-a-sweltering-hot-stove-for-10-hours dishes all these underage-looking juveniles keep bringing to your cluttered table within 10 minutes of you ordering because you can't stop eating, you glutton.

AbPQf-X7awuPFDULiJ43bg,"This place is amazing!! Very authentic, bahn mi sandwiches are on point, broth is rich and savory, but what really impressed me was the staff. They were so genuine and respectful and courteous!.

Definayely coming back over and over!

Our waiter was so gracious, I changed my order 3 times as I didnt understand what the menu said, and each time he was super helpful and made me feel great about being such an annoying customer lol. If you go in. Ask for him and tell him he is awesome. He is an African American by the name of Jamaal.",1
AbPQf-X7awuPFDULiJ43bg,"Just horrible! I believe my cousin now when they say Vietnamese people don't eat out at Vietnamese restaurant in Ohio (and no it's not because they can cook it at home)... The quality of food here is just down right unacceptable as well as their service. 
I'm just going to be straight forward:

Service: 
Waitress or ""cashier"" sat us down. Didn't ask if we needed a high chair for our toddler and no water. 

A group came in after us and immediately got water and got their orders taken.  (At this point I'm still holding my child... no one bother to look at us) 
I just decided to carry my child over to the high chairs and carry it over myself while holding my child on one side...
AND STILL not one waitstaff bother to look at us or come over to us. Eventually I had to wave one waiter down, he just look confused and went back to the kitchen to get us water. 

I had to wave another wait staff down to place and order. My husband accidentally knock over the water. The waiter took our orders and told us that he will be right back to clean the mess up... (the mess was NEVER clean... and when i said never I mean, we pay and the ice was still on the table *see picture for reference*) 
There were different waiters coming to our table to drop our food and FAIL to see or bother to clean the mess that's on the table. 

Over all the whole wait staff needs to be retrain... 

Food: 
Papaya Salad: tasteless... in Vietnamese it's advertise as ""Kho Bo"" meaning ""beef jerky"", but we got pork jerky... the sauce was just plain soy sauce. 

Pho: bland... I normally don't add hoisin sauce or hot sauce. But I had to this time and almost a tablespoon of fish sauce and it was still bland...

I just felt the need to write this because I'm highly disappointed that this place have raving reviews and this is nothing like authentic Vietnamese cuisine. If you think this is great, wait until you have the real deal in places that have a good amount of Viet community, your mind will be blown! 

You are better off investing in a 8 quart instant pot and follow ""Cong can cook pho"" on YouTube....",0
AbPQf-X7awuPFDULiJ43bg,"Ambiance: May be a little tricky to find but park in what seems like the alley between 30th and 31st street, there's a little parking lot and shared entryway with Ha Ahn. The place itself is a little ghetto and staffed with teenagers but service was quick and food arrived pretty quickly.

Food: I had the Pho tai which was prepared perfectly, the noodles were not over cooked or clumpy and the meat thinly-sliced and left rare to finish cooking in the hot broth. The portion size of the large was filling with a generous ratio of meat to noodles. The only flaw to the dish was that the broth itself was mediocre, not bad but also not excellent. The broth lacked the salty savory punch that comes from reducing and concentrating the broth, instead it tasted like good broth was diluted a smidge too much. The Vietnamese coffee was also served traditionally in a pour over with condensed milk in the cup however the coffee had a slightly medicinal characteristic and not quite enough condensed milk to smooth out the coffee.

Overall, i thought my meal at Superior Pho was good but not great. They serve and prepare their dishes traditionally but need to spend just a little more effort increasing the quality of their broth and coffee beans. Between #1 Pho next door and this place, I'd call give this place a slight edge for its authenticity.",0
AbPQf-X7awuPFDULiJ43bg,"PHO SHO!!!!!!!! I love Superior Pho. It's such an easy go-to when you are feeling like you need a little broth in your life. I have tried 2 of the phos so far ( chicken and the #12) and while I highly enjoy them, I believe they could step it up as far as flavor goes. That is my ONLY complaint. Their fried rice is the absolute best I have ever had. It is so fresh and doesn't taste fried in the least bit. The authenticity of the joint is on point.l  I love the bubble tea and the service is always speedy and nice. Definitely a watering hole of mine that my husband and I frequent--especially during the colder months!",1
AbPQf-X7awuPFDULiJ43bg,"I know you're not going to like my next sentence, but bear with me my Yelp companions.  I've never been a fan of Pho.  I think it stems from my (possibly psychological issue) obsession with cheese, wherein I find that a meal without cheese is simply not a meal.  As I've grown up and ""slightly"" worked through these inner demons, I've found that experimenting with non-dairy-based meals is in fact appealing.  Whew.

I wasn't feeling super well, little bit of a scratchy throat, and of course what spoke to me more than anything else?  SOUP.  Usually when the cold bug bites, Panera Broccoli and Cheddar is my staple.  I happen to have someone in my life who's far more experimental with his food intake and pointed us to Superior Pho instead.  My internal voice was kicking and screaming but of course in order to appear like a sane woman, I let the more rational and mature voice answer.  Off we went!

I must say I was a little fearful when we pulled in.  Don't you know though, some of the most delicious restaurants are masked with huge potholes in the parking lot and questionable graffiti lined walls.  I imagine it's to keep the basic people out.  Only authentic locals allowed!  Just kidding... but for real, don't let it deter you.

The PHO itself was fantastic.  I'm not one to try anything too crazy at a place like this - so I stuck with basic beef.  They provided you with basil and lime and sprouts to add some texture.  The noodles were cooked perfectly.  I hate soggy noods.  The heat of the broth was absolutely just right.  I felt like Goldilocks in the Three Little Bears.  Added bits of heat from sriracha in the center of the table certainly leveled up this experience.  

Alright SP, you've made this cheese fanatic a lifetime fan.  Pho-ck Yeah!",0
AbPQf-X7awuPFDULiJ43bg,"One would think that the Pho in Ohio would be cheaper but that is a negative. 

They have a lot of meal combos so you get a spring/summer roll, Pho of your choice, and a drink for like $14.

I picked the pho with everything in it, fried spring roll (you get one), and the viet iced coffee (this is 2 dollars more on top of the meal price). My meal was basically $17. For some reason I just thought it would be like cheaper... side note: cheapest pho ever that I had was actually in Houston (6 bucks a bowl!)

The broth is decent. The spring roll was like from a Chinese rest- not the authentic viet spring roll that comes with lettuce wrap & dipping sauce. Viet coffee was pretty legit- came with the dripper at all. 

FYI: You have to like go through a hallway to get here unless you park in the back. Also-philly pho is still the best!",0
AbPQf-X7awuPFDULiJ43bg,"Went in to this place expecting it to live up to the reviews and its name being Superior. The place felt less than authentic. The only authentic thing about the restaurant were the pictures on the wall. I ordered a spring roll that tasted plain with the meat tasting old and the noodles were not cooked all the way. Also, the content in the spring roll was inadequate for the cost per spring roll. I also ordered two ""large"" pho's but they were actually more like a small. The broth to noodle ratio was just sad. The broth was cloudy and not sweet clearly showing it was not cooked long enough. Also, the noodles were overcooked and clumping together. The waitress also had no clue what streamed vegetables were either when we asked for the side veggies to be steamed. They came cold and unsteamed and neglected. Her attitude towards the request felt just as cold. Needless to say, it was a disappointment and we would never go back. I would have rather eaten at Panda Express than this place.",0
AbPQf-X7awuPFDULiJ43bg,"Flawless food, done perfect, clean natural pure authentic beautiful food! Never had a bad meal with 8+ visits.",1
AbPQf-X7awuPFDULiJ43bg,"This is a hard review for me to write, as Superior Pho is one of the first ""ethnic"" places I ever ate at and is partially responsible for my passion for food. Up until this year I would have given them 5 stars, but something is different about the place. 

The pho used to be the best in town, with a nice savory broth and fresh ingredients. On my last visit it was bland, it was almost like they used chicken broth instead of the wonderful spiced beef broth that I loved so much. 

The bun bo hue gets bonus points for being closer to the traditional soup you would find in Hue, as opposed to the pork-laden cousin popular in Saigon (and America). It's beef only, with a deep pungent broth redolent of shrimp paste and lemongrass. On my last visit, it seemed a little too garlicky, which was confirmed when half of a clove came floating to the top, and it lacked the slight spicy kick that makes the soup that much better.

The coffee...a saving grace! The strongest and most authentic Vietnamese coffee you can find at a Vietnamese restaurant in Cleveland. They serve it in the same glass you get your water in, and it's only half filled. But the strength is what counts here, it is so strong and so thick, just like I had in Vietnam.

The wait staff seems different every time I visit. Sometimes they are friendly and quick, other times they don't seem to care one way or another. Superior Pho has never been like a regular restaurant where your server checks on you throughout the meal, but I still remember the employees being more friendly in the past.

I really want to give this a higher rating, and I won't give up on you, Superior...I just hope you return to your former glory.",0
aeeltEJtud69n6GPy5OATA,"K&K, oh man. I've been going here all my life. Now, I'm not a big meat eater, but the butcher knows what he's doing. I've been shopping here all my life (and I'll readily show my friends this place), the butchers are so knowledgeable and engaging and everyone leaves happy. 

They also have awesome prepared foods and salads. I love the antipasta. This is some authentic Italian shizz. 

My favorite part of the store is the little bakery in the back. The doughnuts and various other desserts look awesome, but the best part is you can always get a warm loaf of bread, just packaged, right off the case. Yum yum yum. 

Oh, and every time I go their wine selection gets better and better! I recently found one of my favorite wines (Red Truck Cab) for under ten bucks.",1
AFafWFYGKjJZ1pTvjnot2g,"So lets get the scenario straight,  you're at an airport  in Cleveland.  If you are like me then you just came from terminal A where the Sam Adams bar informed you that they only serve hot dogs and do not have Sam Adams.   So I was sent to The Pub.  

There are a lot of positive reviews here and, lets face it, it seems like you are stuck here with no choices.  So I will review this as an airport restaurant, not as a place that I would plan a night out to.  It was a pretty standard Americanized British pub menu with an Americanized pub look (English, Scottish?  Yorkshire maybe?).  Nothing special about the food and while the woman who served me was nice the bartender was a bit brusque.  They were dressed authentically like the bartenders in the guild of students back at college in the late 80s -- I don't imagine that many travelers are nostalgic for that though.  Down with Thatcher!  Free Mandella!  Stuff the Poll Tax!  There were some interesting import beers on the menu, I'll give them credit for that.

My preference for an airport restaurant (behind the TSA section) is that it not close me off totally from the airport -- I don't want to forget what I am there for.  Also, if you have lots of TVs and if you are trying to serve your clients (remember this not a real-world pub, but an airport pub), then allow for the closed captioning to be turned on -- it is noisy and your clients (probably business travelers and not families who would find the place pricey) want to know about the news or the weather; things that affect their travel.  You are an airport pub, not a sports bar. 

Two stars because I travel a lot and I have experienced better.  $20 for an appetizer (artichoke dip, largely melted cheese) and a pint.",0
AFafWFYGKjJZ1pTvjnot2g,"Oi, The Pub, a ubiquitous name for an establishment? 

A convenient watering hole located in the main terminal of the Cleveland Hopkins Airport. Birds and Blokes wearing clothing similar to what was fashionable 40 years ago in London. 

Not a bad place to go for a quick pint before a flight. The restaurant will get more and more authentic looking as it gets more worn in and gets the patina of boot marks worn into the bar stools and from peoples elbows resting on the wooden bar. 

I've tried a few of the beers on draught here, I like the Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale. 

Service- unassuming and competent. 

Cheers Mate!",1
AFafWFYGKjJZ1pTvjnot2g,"The Good: its a very large full service pub, not just a small airport bar; very good beer selection including several authentic European brews. The Palm was very good. Service is above average, not like a typical airport bar. Good selection of good. I have been here several times.

The Bad: not really bad but good is average.

Tips: The main bar is huge and wraps around with lots of power outlets.",1
AFafWFYGKjJZ1pTvjnot2g,"I did not eat here ... so this review is just a review of the pub as a place to sit and have a drink before a flight. Amazingly, a beer is ten fucking dollars here on draft but to sit at a stool and watch soccer in a semi-authentic feeling British pub style atmosphere vs. being packed into uncomfortable seats amongst hundreds of people in yoga pants and flip flops with their screaming kids, I'd probably have paid twice that for a beer.

The food didn't look bad for airport food, based on what others were eating. What I liked most was the draft beer selection ... it was listed by country (UK, Ireland, US, etc.) and they had obscure and hard to find beers in the US on draft such as Boddington's and Thistle IPA. The pints are served in 20 oz. UK pints vs. 16 oz. US pints, which is also welcome and fitting given the price.

In London, there are precious few pubs which don't look like this ... you expect craggy old pubs with dusty/faded wood which might have the initials of Charles Dickens scratched into them. Instead, the breweries have taken over the pubs and Disney-fied them making them look 'authentic' in a way that the Olive Garden looks like a Tuscan villa. However, sadly, this manufactured authenticity is the reality in London, so this place feels pretty good. If only they would close off the kitchen which can be seen on the rear wall of the pub, filthy dishes piling up as 20-something year old cooks and dishwashers skate back and forth through the opening.

They even have a little faux fenced in 'outdoor' area where you can sort of people watch while eating and drinking behind a pointy fence with ivy. I dare you to try to light a cigarette on this area.

For what it is ... a spacious pub with a selection of beer on draft I would welcome at my local watering hole ... I'd return for a drink before my flight again. Cleveland Airport is very surprising because as small as it is, it is much more comfortable and has many more food options than bigger airports like LAX and Logan which are split into faraway terminals.",0

aiU0FRtHTIHBWMYapw79LA,"soooo after purchasing a groupon for this  lovely little establishment, we decided to venture out into the snow, wind and ice for a 'relaxing' dinner.....

we had never been here before so this was a brand new experience.....after driving through the streets of cleve town to finally make it here, we ended at our destination..... it's not located in the most desirable part of town, however, as long as your packing heat, you're sure to be good to go....(lol. kidding. sort of.)...it's located near the far north end of w.76th, so if you are driving thru the neighborhood  looking like you are not in the right vicinity, you probably are right where you need to be.....
looking at the outside, it appears to be sort of a derelict looking hang-out, that you might just belly up to the bar with a homeless person,  but keeping that in mind, that we DID just buy a groupon, we decided to venture in. 

what appears to be the front door, under the large sign that says ""REDDSTONE"" is actually not. fake out.....after peeping into the window and tugging the door handle, we found ourselves staring in at two patrons eating their dinner. yikes. 

the  REAL door is actually  on the side of the place. upon entering, there are stairs going up....and the actual bar/restaurant is to your right....but when you walk in, there was no direction....do we seat ourselves, do we just stand here, what next? i should mention is WAS WAY CROWDED. so yes, we looked like two little wolf cubs scared of what we were supposed to do amongst all these people. 

lucky for us, the manager, or whom, i seem to think is the manager, asked if we needed a table and asked if we could sit at the bar for a moment while he cleared a spot. the bartender then contradicted what he just told us 2.7 seconds earlier, that there were no tables available, as she had a 10 top table coming in and the manager (or manager looking guy) was not aware.....uh, ok. now what?????

so our choice....eat dinner at the bar or leave.....BUT lo and behold manager looking guy told us he found a table. lucky us!  (we were not completely opposed to eating at bar.....) 

anyway, long story short end. the groupon was for a limited item listing. it was for app, 2 house salads and a pizza, (with your choice of only either make your own 2 topping or the cleveland something....the chicken pizza was not available for the groupon, even though it was the same price as the cleveland one.....interesting. 

the appetizer we chose were the nachos....one word. HUGE ASS. ok, two words.  taste was meh....(would not order again).....the house salads.....aHHHHHHMMMAAAAZZING. the dressing was delish. would def get again....pizza.....uh, negative. save your pizza meal for an authentic pizza place. 

service: one word: HORRIBLE. very friendly servers, but took forever to give order, get bill, pay bill, etc. etc. etc. the one girl did apologize that there were only two servers and they did not expect to be this busy.....um, ok. let's think about this. you offer a groupon/cheap dining deal, yet you staff with only two peeps? what up with that??? 

anyway, we finally paid our bill and were on our way, back out in the ice/snow/slush.....

p.s. i was told by a friend that the patio is pretty cool, so we might be brave to venture one more time during dining al fresco season........maybe. 

overall....food meh. i was not impressed by any means. the blueberry basal lemonade drink was delish....and could easily see myself cozied up on the patio chilling with one of these in hand.... xo",0

ajCLNse9PXoZniKna0S69Q,"Don Ramon serves a necessary spot in the dining scene for Mexican food in that it's appealing to a wide audience. Basic Americanized Mexican food (not a slam, just my observation) served in a pleasant, clean location off Richmond Road in Warrensville Heights. The restaurant is clean, and the service is incredibly fast and friendly. There are more authentic Tex Mex style places in the area, but if you're looking for more mainstream, good quality, and reasonably priced food, this is the place. I highly recommend the chicken soup. It's made by the bowl by pouring delicious, hot broth over fresh vegetables (avacado, carrot, broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini ). Fresh pulled chicken breast will be swimming in the broth for you to enjoy. Killer soup indeed. Try it sometime and let me know what you think.

Request a few lime wedges to squeeze into the soup. Equally flavorful as many Pho places I've tried.",1
ajCLNse9PXoZniKna0S69Q,This place is really good for authentic Mexican cuisine. The chicken taquitos were delish. What really sold me on this place was the fact that they sold churros-which have been very difficult for me to find in NE Ohio. There's nothing better then a good churro. However I arrived to this place pretty late in the evening and they had already cut the oil off for frying churros. I couldn't even get upset because that confirmed the churros have the potential to be fire! I'll be updating my review once I actually have the opportunity to try the churros. Stay tuned!,1
ajCLNse9PXoZniKna0S69Q,"This is a really cute,  clean Mexican restaurant where the people were very nice and the food was good. It is not unusual for me to get disappointed when I try a new Mexican restaurant because so many of them in this area have different names but what looks like the SAME MENU. Don RamÁE³n had some of the same items as others, of course, but their menu did not look like they were following ""he formula.""  The guacamole was buttery and flavorful and the chips were really delicious with great texture.  I ordered the tacos al carbÁE³n,  which could be ordered with chicken, steak, pork, chorizo or shrimp. They tasted very authentic, served with lime, pico de gallo, and a salsa verde that was distinctive and really added to the flavor of the tacos.  The rice and beans were good and not too salty. I hope people can appreciate that Don RamÁE³n is a little outside the formula of many of the Mexican restaurants we have here. I will go back again when I am in the neighborhood! ",1
ajCLNse9PXoZniKna0S69Q,"Great authentic Mexican food and great atmosphere. I have been here plenty of times  with large parties and Don Ramon is always on point. The food is always hot , fresh , and flavorful. I always get the Taco Loco which is a huge taco with beef, chicken, steak, and veggies. It is always good.  I never had any problems with the service they are always fast and polite. I will definitely continue to go back again. I really love this place.",1
anzCdD5eIEHwydTpXhLlUA,"Happy Dog is certainly a hyped-up establishment right now, and while I am definitely a fan, I still haven't had that amazingly, awesome experience that everyone else seems to have! I think it's slightly overrated as an 'it' place, but either way, I continue to go back, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a chill, laid-back bar, so long as you don't mind that hipster vibe.

I've only ever sat at the bar, and service is always solid... attentive, friendly, and my drink is always full. This really goes a long way for me... I bartend myself, so I know what excellent service is and I swear by the notion that a simple smile goes a long way! Great beer selection, too.

Food- Gotta love the American authenticity of a good 'ol hot dog! Definitely comfort food for me! Yes, I tend to go into a slight food coma afterwards, but it is so worth it! 

Bottom line- It's a great place, but I think it is a little over-rated in the hipster-cool department.",1
aPnAEP8WzjJkxyAJ59GS8Q,This place is my absolute favorite Indian food ever in Cleveland! The man and woman who own it are such sweet hearts. Go here if you want authentic delicious food.  Try the buttered chicken and cauliflower.,1
aPnAEP8WzjJkxyAJ59GS8Q,"Just a hole in the wall, fast food place in Colonial Marketplace with some REAL home cooked indian food. If you're looking for fancy restaurant quality, ridiculously creamy and rich, may be laced with something - indian food, look elsewhere. When i ate my meal from Indies, I literally felt like I was either at home or at a friends house eating their mom's home cookin. I think everything is premade that morning and put out on burners to be kept warm. It may not be made to order, but it definitely still tastes fresh. They have a few veg curries and a couple of meat options. They have naan and a new wrap (that I want to go back to try). Like one of the previous reviews stated, the downfall is the rice they use. You really do need something like basmati rice for indian food.

The owners are a sweet indian couple and they are some of the nicest people you'll talk to. 

The owner closes Indies at 6pm because he said if he doesn't move his car by then, the garage charges him another 25 dollars and he most likely won't make that back by staying an hour later - but I was also told that if I'm running late but still want food, to call him and he will have his wife stay while he just moves his car to street parking. :) 

I'm glad this place is right next door for the times I just want some authentic indian home-cookin.",0
aPnAEP8WzjJkxyAJ59GS8Q,"I was having lunch at another outlet in Arcade. While waiting for my lunch I walked over to Indies. The owner could not have been any nicer or more genuine! Offered me multiple samples, educated me on Indian food, spices, styles...The flavors were authentic and fresh. No wonder he has had a successful 10 year run in this location. Super reasonable prices. Had a lentil soup and will be back for many more complete meals....",1

APPZiUz_CEvR_--qY-tbig,"How can one tell if sushi is the real deal and fresh? For one, tuna should be a bright red and translucent, like how red gelatin looks like. The consistency of fresh sashimi should be firm but not spongy. Fresh salmon, should glisten more. As a rule, the duller the color, the more spongy consistency; the lower the quality. Cleveland suffers from being far from the ocean. Sushi suffers a bit especially in the winter months.

With all that criteria laid out, and having had sushi in Asia as a frame of reference; Pacific East and Shuhei; have the freshest sashimi-grade fish one can find in Cleveland. I order sashimi in places like this. In lesser places I go for rolls and drown it in the sauces to compensate - not here. Sushi rock is good too -- but the quality is the same as Pacific East but at a much higher price. All the good places use authentic short-grain Japanese rice -- watch out for places that try to pull a fast one with substitutes to this kind of rice.

One of my favorite non-sushi dishes is Unagi Don and Shrimp tempura.

Sushi here can't ever be as good as sushi in coastal areas and in Asia, but I'm giving it 4 stars because, all things considered, this is the best in Cleveland.

...as for Malaysian food in a Japanese restaurant, sigh, why? OK, nothing wrong with that, but I have a thing about restaurant ""purity of theme"".",0
APPZiUz_CEvR_--qY-tbig,"This is my go-to spot for dinner or lunch with my boyfriend whenever I'm in town. During lunch hours, the place is fairly empty, but during dinner time, be prepared to wait a couple of minutes to be seated; it's really crowded!

I'm not sure if it's because I'm from NYC but I think they give you so much food for such a low price. My boyfriend and I always get a variation of the maki combo. His favorites are the philadelphia and spicy tuna rolls. Mine is salmon. We both loveeee the ocean roll.

+1 for having green tea and red bean flavored ice cream. Try the mochi ice cream or the tempura ice cream for dessert. I personally like the mochi more, but my boyfriend swears by the mango tempura ice cream. I've tried the green tea. It's super creamy, but it's also a lot of tempura and ice creammm.

Service is really attentive and nice. If you're in town and craving authentic, go here!",1
APPZiUz_CEvR_--qY-tbig,"Just in case anyone is confused, this place actually has two chefs and two menus. It can get pretty busy, but I have never waited long for a table. I generally order off the Malaysian menu here, as I have found the Japanese food here pretty underwhelming. 

A lot of people rave about the sushi here, but it doesn't seem to be anything special to me. I've also ordered the ramen here once, which was a mistake, since I found pieces of undissolved paste in the soup. 

Try the roti chenai here, as it is fluffy and crispy the way it is supposed to, although the curry could be spicier. It is probably one of their best dishes. The Hainanese chicken rice, as well as various stir fried noodles, is all quite good here as well. I would not order the items that are likely to be less frequently ordered, as it is likely to have been sitting in the fridge/freezer for ages. I once ordered the sambal stingray, and it was definitely not fresh and didn't taste right either.

I spent my childhood years in Singapore (15 years, to be exact), and while the food here is not 100% authentic, it generally tastes the way it is supposed to and definitely satisfies my occasional cravings.",0
APPZiUz_CEvR_--qY-tbig,best place for sushi in cleveland. On the Corner of Coventry and Mayfield Road its one of those places you can drive by all the time and never venture into. Its worth the 75 cents in parking to mosey into this great authentic restaurant.,1
APPZiUz_CEvR_--qY-tbig,"I had high expectations for this place - it looked promising on the outside, but once I walked in it sort of felt like any other Japanese restaurant you could find in a strip mall. The sushi was okay, but did not feel very authentic. Also had the sukiyaki which again was okay, but nothing amazing. The waiters/waitresses put in a good effort, but fail to truly deliver. It took me a while to request a spoon so we can share the sukiyaki, and they looked at me like no one has ever requested for a spoon before. The language barrier probably didn't help......",0

I can't vouch for authenticity (although signs point to pretty darn authentic), but I can vouch for deliciousness and value, and both of them are top notch. I usually come for lunch, where $10 gets you two maki rolls, miso soup, and side salad with amazing dressing. If you're not in the mood for fish, the katsu don and salt and pepper eggplant (from the Malaysian menu) are some land-locked favorites. In short, eat here--you can't go wrong.",1
APPZiUz_CEvR_--qY-tbig,"Pacific East is a very down to earth, humble, and traditional japanese restaurant that serves up great quality raw fish. They use authentic japanese ingredients, and it really shines through their food. Priced at about $1-2 more than your usual run-in japanese bar is completely justified by top notch raw fish. 
Pacific.E is a great japanese restaurant for those who appreciate high quality, but humble japanese cuisine.
If they would only stay true to their japanese-focused roots (rather than try and satisfy a vaster Cleveland crowd with a huge multi-ethnical menus) and fine-tune a bit of their kitchen food, this place would absolutely be ""As good as it get's""

--last minute tips--
-I highly recommend their unagi (eel)
as well as any of their Toro sushi's (fatty tuna)
-Their hamachi kama is a GREAT choice for those who do not eat raw fish, but love simple delicious fresh fish
-all in, you can't go wrong with sushi/sashimi/maki rolls
-their Malaysian menu is so-so, nothing that wow-ed

APPZiUz_CEvR_--qY-tbig,"You know how when you go to an ""authentic"" restaurant and it's not really authentic? That's NOT this place. Hands down it's the most authentic Japanese/sushi place in Cleveland and I've been to a lot of them. Here's how I can tell.

1. They always have Toro. You don't find that everywhere. And it was amazing.
2. They have the biggest selection of Sake in Cleveland.
3. Everyone's Japanese. Like from Japan, not a Japanese person who grew up in Parma.

Excellent food. A bit pricey but you're paying for authenticity. If you want strip mall sushi go somewhere else. This is the real deal. Rolls are huge. Got the Maki sushi platter which comes with three ""standard"" rolls and I could not finish half of it. Kids loved it too. Highly recommend.",1
APPZiUz_CEvR_--qY-tbig,"All good things must come to an end, and this is the end for me. Pacific East used to be my go to for sashimi - it being the most authentic sushi stand in Cleveland, albeit moderately overpriced. Fellow grad students from out of state ask me where to go for anything remotely Japanese, and I always point them to this joint in Coventry. But Pacific East has unfortunately fallen prey to the Cleveland quandary. That is to say, due to the lack of viable competition, their product no longer needs to maintain a standard. Not high standards - ""a"" standard. 

I have been visiting Pacific East for over five years. I am a regular there. Most of their wait staff know my face, remember my order. Today, instead of heading out for dinner, I went for lunch after my workout. Craving tasty protein, I ordered the sashimi lunch (the sashimi bento is a lot of food in comparison - well, a lot of rice). The waiter brings me miso soup and salad, fills my green tea. The salad is watery and plain, freezing, likely refrigerated before the lunch rush. He does not fill my tea again, which is strange for them, but I don't dock him for being busy. 

Then the nightmare arrives: a sashimi plate that literally reeks worse than the fish stands at the market. I've never smelled sashimi so terrible - especially from here. I am at first confused - could the waiter not smell it on his way over? How could they serve me something inedible? Fish shouldn't smell. Not when it is fresh and prepared well. Think of rubbery chicken that smells old, beef that gives your belly a turn. I had two pieces after coating them in tear-jerking wasabi and soy - something I never do, an insult to the chef. I spent almost $13 for brown rice and a salad that made me shiver. 

Unfortunately I'll be keeping my sashimi ventures to myself from now on. I'm horrified how far Pacific East has slipped into poor service and repulsive quality. Raw meat is not to be reckoned with - faulty preparation leads to foodborne illness. Certain predatory fish, when not prepared correctly, harbor parasites. This should be common knowledge not only to microbiology students but sashimi chefs as well. I am disappointed, and this hint of rancid fish accompanied me throughout the day. 

Why two stars and not one? Because I have a history with his place, and I am sentimental, an unfortunate character flaw. By all means, continue your visits here if you are a fan of deep-fried tempura, or the popular faux-crab California roll that seems to be a favorite among the Americanos keeping this business afloat.",0
APPZiUz_CEvR_--qY-tbig,"Even if you're not a fan of sushi and/or Japanese food, you should visit and try their Malaysian menu which is outstanding. The rendang, laksa and chow kueh teow are authentic and delicious. Very reasonable priced as well.",1
APPZiUz_CEvR_--qY-tbig,"We order out from here nearly every week.  This is the best restaurant on Coventry. The sushi is always fresh and pretty inexpensive.  The Malaysian food is pretty good too.  The hot food is decent but is not really that authentically Japanese.  I like the hot food at Shuhei better - but their sushi isn't as fresh.

On weekends the place gets pretty busy.  The service has always been very good and complies with our weird requests like no wasabe between the fish and the rice.",1
APPZiUz_CEvR_--qY-tbig,"I have high standards when it comes to Asian food. Especially when it comes to south east asian food. So if you are wondering why I giving them 2 stars, it's because, like you, I know what burgers are suppose to taste like and if you would to end up at a Mickey Dees in India and ordered their ""hamburger"" you would say ""they call this burger?""
To say that the food taste bad is not fair, it taste ok. Except, I think they can do so much better. The staff are from Malaysia so I know they can serve the real stuff. But somehow or rather, they've decided to ""Americanize"" southeast asian food. Come on! Stop it with the patronizing to the locals. Clevelanders are awesome at recognizing awesome food when it is. When you water down the coffee, you may serve more cups but you don't get the passionate followers who will in turn get more people to show up at your doorsteps!
That's my rant. Now on to the food. 
Sushi was ok. I've not had too much to excite me lately when it comes to Japanese food. Pacific East's sushi didn't either.  I really need to find a good sushi/ noodle house soon. Maybe I'll drive to nyc this week.
I posted a photo of their menu for their south east asian cuisine. I was brought up eating this stuff. I've had the good, the bad and the runs from when I was growing up there. So to be truly honest, my fellow americans, you may enjoy the Nasi Lemak or the Roti Channi. But just know they are so much better in it's unfettered state.
I do find it intriguing though that they do not refill your pop (soda, soft drinks). Something that is rather authentic to the asian dining experience.",0

salt and pepper king oyster mushrooms and tofu.
satay tofu.
curry noodles with tofu
vegetarian tofu clay pot.

not that i eat a lot of tofu or anything........ but if you want tofu, this is the place to get it! great place for vegetarians and vegans!",1

The freshest of fresh when it comes to fish and produce, they have product shipped in from NYC weekly. Amazing. Price range is very affordable, lunch for $10 including soup, salad, tea and I think about 4 different rolls of your choice. I personally love their Naruto rolls, wrapped in cucumber and a special sauce..... I don't know what the special sauce is and I will never ask but it's delicious!",1
APPZiUz_CEvR_--qY-tbig,"Good food for a great price. We came here for lunch and ordered yaki soba (with salad included) and prawn mee (with spring roll included). Both were very good and service was excellent for how busy it gets at lunch. 

Although I can see how the quality of ingredients can improve (e.g., fish patties in the prawn mee?), I was pleased that this authentic place did take care in presentation (e.g., taking off shrimp tail shells in the prawn mee) and blended authentic food with some standards. This isn't a fancy restaurant nor a fast food place, so it's perfect for a casual meal and suits Coventry well.  

I have only gotten the Japanese sushi here once or twice, where I believe the fish hadn't been that fresh nor impressive, so I have gotten Malaysian cuisine ever since.  For casual Malaysian food, this place is a nice little find.",1
APPZiUz_CEvR_--qY-tbig,"I am astonished at the rating for Pacific East, as was one reviewer, I don't think Pacific East deserves a 4 star rating. It's like benihana's or sushi rock, and people just think they're eating great Japanese food, from chain restaurants like this. NOTHING is authentic here, not even the staff.

well if you're looking for cheap ""japanese"" food, this is the place for you. 

But if you want GOOD authentic japanese food I'd go elsewhere.  You'll probably pay a bit more, but it'd be worth it.   I'd try Shinano's Sushi Bar and Japanese cuisine. They have great sushi, and an authentic Japanese  menu. (If you're going to PE for other food, I guess thats fine)

I got a tonkatsu dinner (pork cutler) and i think I just ate panko breading... If there was actual pork in there, I'd be surprised. I also had gotten a sashimi app. and a roll. Now the ""freshness"" of the fish is deceiving. Pretty much anywhere you go, you will be eating frozen fish, since we are in Ohio (unless you go to some really expensive place with FRESH fish). So no one can really say that they have the best ""fresh"" sushi. But I have to say the sushi rice was pretty bland, and overall didn't wow me. 

But I was pretty disgusted at the quality of my meal. 

And, along with one of the reviewers, the staff can get persistent and annoying if you're the only group dining... 

But this place isn't inedible, it's just over rated, and you'll get what you pay for.",0

APPZiUz_CEvR_--qY-tbig,"I am not from the Cleveland area but could not pass by the opportunity to have Malaysian food. I am fairly knowledgeable with this cuisine since I have eaten it(or something similar) from birth. 

The staff at Pacific East were friendly. The restaurant looked really dark but seemed clean enough.

We ordered the roti canai, curry puffs and satay appetizers. The roti canai was fairly authentic - I balked at the price for the amount we got but it was the best dish of the night. The curry puffs were average. The satay was bland - do not bother with this at all. 

For our entrees, we tried the nasi lemak, mee siam and mee goreng. The nasi lemak was okay, I guess - instead of serving a spicy sambal, they served a thin and sweet tomato sauce. The chicken rendang served as part of the nasi lemak (not a traditional component) was disappointing.  The mee siam was hands down horrible. It was similar to a flavourless pad thai. The mee goreng was okay but tasted nothing like it was supposed to. Even though the entrees were largely untouched, the servers did not ask us if everything was okay. Granted, we should have spoken up but it was 9pm and we had just driven almost 5 hours. At the end of this meal, we were more ready than ever to just pass out.

I am giving them 3 stars (instead of 2) because I would order the roti canai and curry puffs again and it is simply possible that I ordered the wrong dishes. It is possible that if I didn't know what the dishes were supposed to taste like, I would have enjoyed them more. Also, their sushi might be their strong suit. So, I will give them another try on my next visit to Cleveland.",0
APPZiUz_CEvR_--qY-tbig,"Decided to try this place out after hearing raving reviews about the food. We went on a Saturday night, and it was packed. Good thing we made a reservation or else we would have been stuck in a long line with our empty stomachs. 

The ambience at Pacific East is nice. The restaurant is dimly lit with fish/sea shell decor on the walls that complements the name of the restaurant.

Upon glancing at the two extensive menus (one for Japanese food, the other for Malaysian), I was a bit overwhelmed. One of the entrees we ordered was a maki combo, with one of the sushi rolls being crab. I'm a huge sushi fan, but I was not impressed with the sushi here at Pacific East. 

Maybe we were expecting too much, but it was a bit misleading when we tasted imitation crab in the crab rolls. I think they could have at least been a little more specific in their menu that they're using imitation crab instead of actual crab. Regardless, the sushi was just okay. Nothing special and nothing worth raving about.

Can't say much about the Malaysian food at the restaurant, but I didn't think that Pacific East served authentic Japanese food/sushi. My theory is that if a restaurant is serving two very different types of Asian cuisine, chances are the restaurant is only doing one of them justice at best. 

Maybe I'll go back to try some of the Malaysian food some time, but probably not going back for sushi. Still on the look for a go-to place for sushi in Cleveland...",0
APPZiUz_CEvR_--qY-tbig,"Usually when you see an Asian restaurant that has every type of asian continent's food, the first thing you think is that this place must suck at every dish because it's probably not authentic.

APPZiUz_CEvR_--qY-tbig,"I'd have to say the best authentic food around the Coventry area for sushi and Malaysian food. The ingredients are fresh and you can actually taste it. I came here with a couple of friends before and haven't really written a review  until I went back recently and tried their Prawn Mee soup. 

This was hella (excuse my North Cal slang) excellent. Even though it didn't come with prawns as the picture but it had the prawn taste to it. Plenty of shrimp and noodles, this hit the spot especially on a rainy day like yesterday. I came here with a friend and we also ordered their spider roll and it was plenty (they pack their food big here). My friend ordered their beef noodle stir fry which tasted great as well. Like other places I've tried, this was the best. The noodles weren't soggy and there was plenty of food for just the 2 of us. 

The wait staff was friendly and attentive. The place was getting busy around dinner service around 6-8pm and I'm not sure what their hours are on Sunday but if a place still gets busy around 8, they are doing something right. The only downside of this is that parking is metered so make sure you bring plenty of quarters!",1

AsVR-X40wAzI7z7oRpsbTA,"First visit today and I am definitely visiting again to try more dishes! 
It was really cold and I was craving some authentic pho (moved here from Chicago so I was spoiled) and read about Cuisine du Cambodge on yelp. We were around the area, so on we went! I must say, I am really glad we did pay this place a visit! :D
They have an extensive menu and because there weren't any pictures on the menu, it was quite hard to figure out what was what (I like places with pictures of food on their menu). 

Anyways, the waiter was super friendly and suggested we get Chha Kreoung Ma Rass Prowt, so we got the seafood with steamed rice. We didn't know how spicy the 'hot' option would be, so went with regular. I would get 'hot' next time though. The dish was just.. awesome! Really tender pieces of squid, green pepper and shrimp all danced in a coconut cream sauce. It was sort of like Thai curry but different. 
Definitely something to try again :)

We also ordered the house special pho with tendon (extra $1.50). I would say pho...wasn't as good as what I'd get back home. The broth was a bit too greasy for my taste but also very rich which I did like. Rice noodles were a little thicker than I'm used to but the tendon and beef pieces were awesome.

Oh, I wouldn't want to forget the rice paper rolls. They were fresh, chewy and a good size. Definitely one of the best I've had. :)

All in all, I'd say I found a restaurant I wouldn't mind driving 25 minutes to, and will definitely be back in the near future. 

Though, if only there was a good parking lot for the restaurant... One would have to park in the street since we didn't find any other places to park.",1

Hard to find these days. Almost made to feel like an old friend and it was my first time. 

The food is extremely varied. I had a small - not so small- bowl of hot and spicy vermicelli soup that was wonderfully spicy and had great depth.  My spicy noodles had so many great flavors from peanut to lemongrass and hint of ginger.  The plate was enough for 2 or 3 people.  Huge portion, but the quality was even better. 

I very strongly recommend this place.  If you like authentic Vietnamese /Cambodian food run here. Big thumbs up!",1
AsVR-X40wAzI7z7oRpsbTA,"I came to Cuisine du Cambodge with somewhat high expectations given the Yelp reviews and some very strong recommendations from friends and family alike, and, food-wise, I think the restaurant largely met those expectations.  The Shrimp Roll appetizer was good, though it was overcooked and I can't say I was a fan of the unexpected mayonnaise-based sauce hidden inside.  The Beef Loc Lac was a solid beef and onion combination dish and goes well with the included fried rice (which, at $9.95, is quite a value).  I really enjoyed, though, the Somlaw Machou Kreoung (aka Sour Fantasy Stew), which we were warned featured ""really strong flavors.""  When served over the accompanying white rice, those flavors--highlighted by the lemon grass--get soaked up into the rice and, as a result, a little more evened out.

The reason for the 2-star review, however, was the unfortunate and growing collection of used plates (multiple stacks, some four or five high) on several tables in the small dining room that remained unbussed throughout our dinner.  At least as a matter of hygiene if not aesthetics, it's an issue with a simple solution that should be addressed.  If not for that problem, given the good combination of authenticity and value, Cuisine du Cambodge would have merited a strong 3-star rating.",0

AsVR-X40wAzI7z7oRpsbTA,"Grabbed dinner here Saturday night.  

First of all, this place from the outside is very underwhelming, as well as the inside of the restaurant leaves a lot to be desired.  That being said, you are coming here for an authentic meal, not to be wowed by a fancy foyer and cool looking art on the walls. Note - This is a BYOB (savings!)

The food here is as authentic as being guests in a Cambodian families home.

It's a small mom and pop restaurant, with a very extensive menu.   It's entirely run by a family, from the Mom making the meals to the daughters serving you while their Dad oversees things.

My friend Jane and I both had the Combination Coconut Chicken, Beef and Shrimp Chha Kreoung Ma Rass Prowt.  It was very fresh and tasty.  I had them prepare it medium spice, which is definitely tempered to a midwestern palate.  If you are looking for an Asian Spice level of medium just mention it when you order and they will oblige.

My wife had the Chna Bun Kari, which she also enjoyed very much. 
The 4th member of our table had the special (the name escapes me) which again, he said was excellent.

 The portions are quite large so keep that in mind while considering an appetizer or dessert.  

Overall I highly recommend supporting this local restaurant that is both priced competitively, and an excellent quality.",1
AsVR-X40wAzI7z7oRpsbTA,"Best place for authentic Cambodian food. I've never been to Cambodia, but the flavors in every dish I've tried are so delicious and unique. It's a really amazing place. My mom lives in San Fran, and whenever she comes to visit me here in Cleveland, we always make a trip to Cuisine du Cambodge, order several dishes and share everything. It's the best! I hope this place always stays in business!",1
AsVR-X40wAzI7z7oRpsbTA,"Overwhelmed by the largeness of the menu, I restricted myself to the house specials and got the mikroolaa ($6.75), which is a noodle dish with egg, pork, peanuts, dried shrimp, and small pieces of vegetables. If anyone was wondering based on the menu description--the dish is indeed hot in temperature, not like a noodle salad as I thought it might be before I ordered. I loved the assorted crunchy toppings as well as the tangy flavor of the noodles, reminiscent of pad thai but less heavy since the dish is not stir-fried. I appreciated and felt nostalgic eating the savory dried and various small pieces of pickled vegetables, as it's not often that those more ""weird"" ingredients are included in Asian restaurants in America. I ate the whole thing, and felt satisfied but not feel grossly weighed down at the end of the meal. For an inexpensive, large portion of food, Cuisine du Cambodge is definitely a win!

Even though this non-fast food stop became quite a long rest stop for us on our road trip, I'm glad we took the little detour and time to sit and eat at this small, sweet, authentic Cambodian restaurant randomly in the Cleveland. I really have no idea when I will be able to come again, but I look forward to the opportunity and highly recommend it for those who are able to go.",1
AsVR-X40wAzI7z7oRpsbTA,"WE ARE OBSESSED WITH THIS PLACE!  

We have been coming here for years, way back to when the original owners of Phnom Penh (which now own Cuisine Du Cambodia) were here.  We stayed with this location during the ownership change and for a time continued to go to Phnom Penh, as that is what we were most familiar with.  We heard that the original owners were back and had re-opened the restaurant on Lorian rd. and W 130th so we came back!  WOW!!!  This place is so much better!  The portions are LITERALLY double the size of what you get at Phnom Penh and the prices are the same or less.  My husband and I usually order 2 or 3 dishes and eat them ""family style"" rather than having to choose only one dish.  You get so much food that we both eat until we are ready to explode and still have enough leftovers to bring home and eat one or two more times!   We bring a cooler filled with beer (as beer is the perfect compliment to the spicy cuisine).  We order everything HOT but you can order according to your spice preferences...although some of the dishes lend themselves to being enjoyed spicy and just simply do not translate well otherwise (in our opinion).  

Our favorites are:  Beef Hue Soup, Egg Rolls, Pork Pad Thai HOT, #39 HOT, and Asian Basil Combination Fried Rice HOT.  Woo hoo!!!!  But, you probably cannot go wrong with any of the dishes because everything is fresh and authentic and wonderful.  You must try it!!!  You may end up addicted to the food like we are!",1
AsVR-X40wAzI7z7oRpsbTA,"yumm another authentic Asian restaurant!

we ordered three dishes - spicy ginger noodle the house signature dish, 41a which is stir fried vermicelli sour version, and chicken coconut Chua kreoung ma rass prowt. I would highly recommend all three of them - they are all very different and yummy. the ginger noodle is more seafood like and spicy. the vermicelli is sour but I LOVE the fried tofu in the dish, and the chicken coconut dish was very curry like and satisfying. tastes like home comfort food. the price was pretty reasonable too. three dishes was definitely enough for two meals for two people who can eat a lot haha.

my only complaint is their service speed. again, this is a family own restaurant so it is kinda expected that it is going to be understaffed. so be prepare to wait for at least half an hour before you get your food. also, the kitchen tend to be super smoky - it definitely made me cough when I was walking pass the kitchen to go to the bathroom.",1
AsVR-X40wAzI7z7oRpsbTA,"I've never been to Cambodia, Vietnam, or Thailand, so rather than being influenced by reviews exalting authenticity, which might not necessarily mean good-tasting to some palates---whether a Cambodian dish, a Thai, Italian, Mexican, French, Yugoslavian, Greek, or Samoan---I was convinced to try Cuisine Du Cambodge based on their impressive star power.  If it tastes so good to so many, I'm in.  And Annette, who took our order over the phone, was likeable, friendly, and helpful, making the best first impression.   

Whoa.  We never expected to be so disappointed with our take-out menu choices.   I have to believe that two of our off-putting dishes were mistakes---not authentic.  They couldn't possibly have been what they were intended to be. 
     
Although some were flavorful enough---Stir-fried Spicy Beef (43), Spring Roll, Shrimp Roll, and Egg Roll---these two were inedible.  Couldn't eat more than a couple of fork-fulls.  
 52 HOUSE SPECIAL MI CHHA (Lo Mein) . . . 
       noodles may have been stale (I've ended up 
       with stale myself, but tossed out after tasting 
       first---before adding to other ingredients), 
       or weren't rinsed well with cold water after 
       boiling.  Sounds odd, but true.  A residual 
       thing---especially with some ramen-style 
       noodles; or maybe it was seasonings---
       incorrect, the ratio, combination of, or old
 53 VEGETABLE FRIED RICE . . . 
       very greasy with a strange, earthy-like flavor; 
       may have been colored with turmeric, which, 
       if too much added---or old---will make a dish 
       taste unappetizing; too meager an amount of 
       peas and carrots 
        
I may not be Asian, but I'm familiar enough with Asian dishes to know when results are successful or not---having prepared them for years, mostly Chinese, Indian, and Thai, using cookbooks from respected authors.   
   
Even favorite, frequently-prepared dishes from highly-rated restaurants of any nationality/country, can occasionally fall short for whatever reason.  
* purveyors not providing the freshest ingredients, 
   and owners unwittingly (or maybe not) using 
   them
* unwashed vegetables/fruits
 
But there's another, more likely reason, for mistakes.  It could be as seemingly harmless as distracting the person involved in any of the prepping or cooking processes, if even momentarily.  That's especially risky with most Asian dishes, as the strictest attention is required because of the many steps, the necessary quick-fire speed, and the number of ingredients.  And prepping Asian foods involves more than most other types of foods.  After cleaning and trimming the proteins and vegetables, there's the chopping, shredding, steaming, boiling, egg-washing, dipping, breading, slicing, dicing, and even some pre-roasting, too.  Then all the measuring and mixing for various sauce preparations, plus readying all those distinctly unique and exotic seasonings, herbs, and spices to add to so many different dishes.  A lot going on.  

Interruptions during any of these steps---especially the lightening speed cooking, saucing, and seasoning, demanding concentration and timing for even average results---can quickly turn a favorite into a flop.  Like their House Special Lo Mein.  
""House Specials"" should ALWAYS be as close to perfect as possible.   Ours even smelled bad.

Also...     
Be VERY clear when ordering over the phone.  Repeat your order, PRICES too, if using their menu---or you might receive something that you didn't want.  When I ordered 43, Stir Fried Spicy Beef, I said I'd like the Vegetable Fried Rice with it.  (Clearly, right above 42 to 45, in bold, capitalized type under the ""Steamed Rice Dishes"" heading---it states ""$2.85 ADDITIONAL WITH VEGETABLE FRIED RICE"".)  To me, there was no interpretation other than this was a SUBSTITUTE for steamed.   But when my husband picked everything up, the total was about $2.00 more.  No big deal---prices may have increased.   Well, that wasn't the case, once I opened the containers.  

They charged 4.75---not the printed $2.85---packing a FULL size of vegetable fried rice, and STILL packed the small container of plain steamed---what I didn't 
want.  May have been a misunderstanding between Annette and whoever was cooking, but surely they don't ever offer upcharged rice to ADD even MORE rice to a dish that already comes with it, then charge FULL price for a FULL order.  Someone should have caught that mistake.  It was less than $2 more, but that's not the issue.  It's principle.  I wasn't in Thailand trying to figure out how to order from a menu written in unfamiliar characters.  I was a 15 minute drive from this Cleveland restaurant, ordering from a menu in English with US dollar amounts, taken by a fluent English-speaking person.  

I might give them another try, but I'm wary.  I'd hate having to throw out more of their mistakes.  So far, nearly $15 worth is unappetizing enough.",0
AsVR-X40wAzI7z7oRpsbTA,"Love authentic mom and pop places where the food is real, inexpensive and lots of it. I went here with a coworker. We split a soup and an entree. We ate until stuffed and still had two meals to take home. Fantastic. I will be back. The only complaints: I go to Cambodian for authentic and hot/spicy. I ordered the hot bun bo hue soup. It was not hot. My nose didn't run. Unlike the one at Siam Cafe where you cough and the chili oil floats on the surface. And though I eat habanero and ghost pepper sauces, at Phnom Penh, I order medium because the hot is painful. I would like more heat. They also don't have the wonderful stuffed chicken wings.",0
AsVR-X40wAzI7z7oRpsbTA,"It was a regular Friday night, around 8PM...

First impression- it looked pretty low-key and small from the outside. And yes, after walking inside, it was indeed small and packed. I'm not sure how packed it usually is but from reading the other reviews, apparently this is pretty common. 

We were seated pretty promptly and things seemed to be going well. I think there was only one person working as a waitress - she was nice, but it looked like she was tired... and probably overworked. This is a family owned place and I think her parents run it. Anyways, she was nice. We went off her recommendations. 

We started off with some appetizers. Spring roll, rice paper roll, and fried tofu. Everything tasted great. I especially thought the spring roll was delicious. Unfortunately though... waited close to an hour for the appetizers!! And the waitress forgot about one of them. We basically got the appetizers at the same time as main meal. Which.... kind of defeats the purpose of getting appetizers :( I don't think it was the waitress's fault... it was busy but still...!! That being said, it's possible that I may pass on the appetizers next time, if it's super busy. But if you decide to go with some appetizers, the spring roll is awesome and if it's not so busy, definitely go for it.

As for the main meals, we got the 74 (penh vegetable kuy tiev chha) and the 119 (chicken chha kreoung). Both are pretty good options if you want to try something authentic/cambodian. Overall, this is a great place for vegetarians! Speaking of which, the spring roll has chicken in it... so if you're not a carnivore, stay away. Also, my friend and I were both accustomed to spicy food - and both went with a medium spice level and were content. Not too spicy by any means but just enough to still appreciate the food's taste with a kick.

Overall, I would have given this more than 3 stars EASILY but with the wait and primarily the appetizers fail...it wouldn't be justified. If I wanted the appetizers at the same time as the main meal, I wouldn't have cared but in this case and pretty much every case, I like to have the appetizers before the main meal! That kind of represents poor service :(

Anyways, will I come back???...of course! Prices are very reasonable, on the more inexpensive side which is great if you're a broke med student. The food is good, honestly, but I have to always consider restaurant service etiquette when reviewing restaurants which is why I'm not giving it a 4 or 5. And ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS, support small business and family owned restaurants! If/when I do come back, I'll update my review...

If you're going to get anything from this rant: Try it out! By the way, you'll likely have to park nearby on a side street (very easy to do)... I think there are about 3-4 spots in front, and that's all.",0
AsVR-X40wAzI7z7oRpsbTA,"A lot of Asian carry-out restaurants have the distinct smell of old fryer grease.  Not this place.  This is the closest I've had to authentic Far East in the states even though I haven't been to Cambodia.

I'm not wow-ed, blown away, or overly thrilled about the Gypsy Bean, and the coffee, like me, was a bit bitter. Also, I was a bit surprised to find a plethora of grounds at the bottom of my coffee. Usually when I'm swallowing something that's a surprise it ain't coffee beans.

The yellow blanketed atmosphere leant a certain sense of authenticity to the joint even if it felt as if a thickly mustachioed man of advanced age was going to come in any moment with a Betacam and record a bang session with a Peacock eye-shadowed lady of the night. Or early evening.

I do highly recommend going for the people watching and the desserts which are both fairly fantastic. Huzzah!",1

How a steak that costs $1.89 ($2.50 at Walmart) can taste better than a $50 restaurant steak is beyond me.  I've eaten at a lot of great steak places (consulting lends itself to that experience), but this home-cooked filet from ALDI's really rates among them.

This store knows what it wants to be and lives up to it - low cost, high value.  Guess I better save my quarters, so I can rent a shopping cart next time I stop in.  I'm an ALDI's shopper now!",1

This could be a 5 star place if they were were a little more authentic in the atmosphere and dÁE©cor.  But, the food is more important when talking about a restaurant so we'll start there.  The food is some of the best authentic German food in Cleveland.  It beats the food at Hofbrauhaus hands down, in my opinion.  The schnitzel is some of the best around.  I had that on my first visit and I actually wanted seconds!  Not because I didn't get a large enough portion (I certainly did!) but because it was that good.  The sausage platter was really good and gave you a great way to try things.  They do have seem to h""e a different menu for either the bar area or for late night because when were there last weekend it was a pared down menu than the first time we were there.  I don't think they cut things out of the menu, I think we just had a different menu at the bar than in the dining area where we were the first time.

There was a lot of food! To the hunger and deliciousness of the food it was gone by the end of our lunch along with our drinks. The house made tiramisu topped off our meal, definitely a must have.

My husband's family is German and are VERY picky about their German food.  The moment we arrived, were greeted warmly by the owners, and the service was outstanding the entire evening.  It was quite a warm evening and sitting outside...they quickly refilled waters.  The beer selection is abundant and as a wine drinker, they had an adequate amount of wines to choose from, given that it is a brewery.
For appetizers, we couldn't have been more pleased with the yummy soft pretzels with mustard and the very authentic potato pancakes.  Crispy on the outside and soft and delicious on the inside.  We ordered the Wienerschnitzel, sausage platter and Jaegerschnitzel, all with spaetzle and sauerkraut as entrees.  First, I'd have to say that the portion sizes are not ""huge"" like other German restaurants but in a good way.  They were actually perfectly portioned and we had leftovers to take home.  The schnitzel was perfectly cooked as was the soft and fluffy spaetzle.  We stole some of the jaegerschnitzel's gravy for our spaetzle and possibly would have liked an option for some on the side. 
All and all, we will be back at Hansa...it felt a little like home : )",1

bfF90MspMbqLWdcEU9JLcg,"1.5 stars. Meh, I've experienced way better.

After finding that the Korean and sushi place in Parma were closed on Sundays (why oh why???), we quickly looked on Yelp, looking for an Asian place to go. Having passed Wild Ginger by the entrance of the freeway before, I said, why not? And off we went.

It's a nice restaurant- not your typical authentic Chinese restaurant which is usually small and kind of dirty. Also, their food wasn't very authentic at all. Sigh. I don't even know why I had hopes it might be good.

First, my friend ordered all calamari. It was completely a deep fried ...... thing. None of us couldn't even find the calamari in these big pieces of deep friedness. Bleh bleh.

Next the entrees:

Singapore noodles: Usually I love singapore noodles. But man, here.... it wasn't flavorful and just kind of...blah. 

Sesame Prawns and Scallops: That actually was okay. Still..... not authentic, but that was alright.

Chow fun- um no. I'm Canto- and those were NOT Cantonese noodles. The noodles were these weird skinny consistency, and it seemed like they cooked with dow see. I mean, I love dow see, and I like it with the fish in the can it comes with, but...ummm....on chow fun? I think not.

The service was rather slow- and there was only one other party in the entire restaurant at 2pm on a Sunday afternoon. And our water wasn't getting refilled. Boo.

Yeah, not a fan. Maybe if you like the non-traditional stuff, go ahead...but if you like authentic Chinese places, this is not the place to go. I should have known when she started recommending the General Tso's chicken (which is NOT a typical Canto dish, by the way....ugh).",0

bgNmUYcraelf27TviWEMGA,"My favorite place for breakfast on the East side of Cleveland. Period. Need I say more? 

Well, I'm going to anyways. 

When I lived in Cleveland Heights, this was my regular breakfast stop. I mean like, probably at least once a weekend. It's a consistently good little diner that's cheap and has one of the best veggie omelets around. I don't even think that it's on the menu. I just usually ask them to make me one. What makes it so good? Well, I'm not sure..but they put avocado in it, and that's enough for me to love it. That nom-ness plus some hash browns and rye toast makes Cara a happy gal. 

On weekends it's usually busy around the afternoon and brunch time. If you're anything like I was then, you're not getting anywhere before 10am on Saturday afternoons. So, in that case, expect a little wait. It's usually never a long one though, and trust me - it's worth it. The menu always has a good mixture of home-cooked favorites and new twists.  Make sure you always check out the specials board too! 

Yes, the tables are very close together in the dinning area and if it's busy, it can get a little hectic. But, it's only like that because it's good! Think about some of the most popular restaurants in Cleveland. All their tables are close together too. Anyways, it doesn't really bother me unless I had a few too many the night before. Speaking of hangovers, they also offer a few alcoholic bevs in the afternoons. Hello, Bloody Mary. 

The waitresses at the Inn seem like they've all been there for a pretty long time. I've never had a bad service experience there, but when it gets busy, just expect them to be a little bogged down. Although, I'm not the kind of person who freaks out if my coffee cup is empty for a hot second. 

Bottom-line, the Inn on Coventry is the perfect little diner for a home-cooked breakfast with fresh ingredients at a decent price. The atmosphere and the food will warm you from your stomach to your heart. If you on the East side of Cleveland, this is where you find a good breakfast or brunch.",1
bgNmUYcraelf27TviWEMGA,"If you are looking for a brunch restaurant with quick service, an affordable price, and a menu selection where you just can't go wrong, then this is the place you need to try out. It's a crowded and bustling restaurant especially on Sunday mornings, and the tables are very close together, so you may wind up with some new friends after the meal, which makes for a pretty neat ""community-like"" brunch experience! If you go early, around 9:30am, you may be able to avoid the wait.

Once seated, there's very little waiting time from there on out. Service is excellent. They are speedy and efficient with getting the orders and also very attentive with filling up mugs at all the tables with delicious hot coffee - in fact I don't think my mug was ever empty for the entire time I was there. In terms of food, I highly recommend any one of the Eggs Benedict selections on the menu, especially if you are looking for something savory and filling. There's many other options to choose from besides Eggs Benedict (like pancakes, omelettes, etc.), so there's something for everyone. Overall, this is the perfect brunch place in the Cleveland Heights area if you want the the taste of a home-cooked meal in a vibrant and casual atmosphere at a great price.",1

I went for my usual veggie omelet with dry rye toast and once again, my standby didn't fail me. But, this time I opted for a side of biscuits and gravy for the dude and I to share--my first ever Inn On Coventry sausage gravy experience. Nom. Who the hell is Bob Evans?

bgNmUYcraelf27TviWEMGA,"We saw how this seemed to be a Yelp favorite.
Not so favorite for us. Went for breakfast : coffee was bland and it tasted like the pot hadn't been cleaned in ages. I ordered the eggs Benedict that I was told was very popular (the hollandaise was not authentic- it tasted like a fatty yellow gravy ). The biscuits and gravy was a hit with one person in the party. The other complaint on the breakfast egg special was that it was greasy. It's not like the place was packed either. The restaurant itself is charmingly decorated, and everyone that worked there were polite.",0
BiM04hM-1x3OfVJkxoucUQ,What this restaurant lacks in curb appeal it more than makes up for in the  flavorful and authentic food. The restaurant has been recently updated and looks beautiful inside. The staff is very friendly and helpful. This place is worth trying.,1
bjbegGikWzSgeVsOJdE22g,"If you want an authentic burrito (not the americanized heart attack that is a chipotle burrito) there is no better place in Cleveland than Chili Peppers. Simple as that.

Everything's fresh, prices are good, portions are great. Workers are always friendly. There's nothing not to love about this place.

Doesn't matter where you're at, make the trip (unless you're downtown then just hit their stand in the old arcade), it's worth it.",1
bjbegGikWzSgeVsOJdE22g,The food is delicious and very good. This is the same setup like Chipotle. The difference with this place is the food is authentic and very good. Chipotle has higher sodium in it. If your accustom to Chipotle this place food may taste bland to you. I would recommend this place over Chipotle.,1
bjbegGikWzSgeVsOJdE22g,I go here for lunch sometime and the food is always very good. The ingredients taste fresh and more authentic than other restaurants and the prices are very reasonable. The wet burrito with chipotle sauce on top is the go to and I encourage anyone to try it! I need to continue to go so that I can get my free meal soon. Highly recommend!,1
bK5nWi1oNs63utSlzmRUNg,"So.... this place is AMAZING!!! The ramen is very authentic and the broth is to die for. I've had a few appetizers that were all wonderful, especially the wings. The ONLY downfall is that it is a bit pricy :( Give me that bowl of sweet delicious ramen for $9.00 and I'll eat there twice a day! Sad truth is I can get a larger bowl of the most amazing pho from Superior Pho for right around $9.00. You guys have the BEST ramen... let us get more of it for a price that is easier to digest... PLEASE!  Or add a rewards program?!? Or add noodles to the happy hour menu?!? Overall--so great, I eat there almost weekly!",1
bK5nWi1oNs63utSlzmRUNg,"Anyone in the greater Cleveland area knows that the struggle is real to find good ramen. Noodles are life... so why is it so hard to find them in our beloved city? Enter Xinji. We ordered the spicy ramen and a few pork buns. The noodles actually had texture and taste to them, and the broth was really filling. I needed a giant doggy bag. Don't forget to add an egg on top. It's worth it! I was pleasantly surprised.

As for the vibe, as other's have pointed out-- its industrial minimal. The chairs aren't ergonomic (this is something I wish restaurants in CLE would get on board with :/), so it did kind of hurt my back after a while. You also may end up at a community table, so be ready for that (I don't care about that, but I know some people do). Overall, the vibe is cool and it feels like an authentic addition to this neighborhood. There's plenty of free street parking, so don't rule Xinji out!

We came on a weekday early night and didn't see our server much at all. We tended to ask for everything at once because we didn't know when he'd be back. However, I totally recognize that they might still have kinks to work out with their service. When I come back in the future, hopefully that will be worked out!",1
bK5nWi1oNs63utSlzmRUNg,Everything here feels authentic and tastes great. The portions for the rice bowls are nice!,1
bK5nWi1oNs63utSlzmRUNg,"I would have given the food three stars but our waiter made my night.

One day I was really craving both korean fried chicken and ramen. On the same day, I found an article about this shop in Ohio City and decided to look at its menu. What did they have? Korean fried chicken AND ramen! This place serves old school korean fried chicken, the skin is not crispy whereas the modern KFC 2.0 has very thin and crispy skin.

We each ordered a noodle dish I got ramen and we shared a boneless KFC. When our noodles came out, we were so hungry and took care of that first before wondering where our appetizer was. The dish was very salty, I got the dipping ramen so it made a bit more sense that the dipping soup would have a stronger flavor. I'm not sure if it is supposed to be this way for dipping ramen, but I am very used to eating ramen very quickly while it is still hot. That is the way I have always learned and known to eat it, but this was certainly not your most authentic quick bite hot ramen shop. Nonetheless, it satisfied a craving and was quite good!

We finally got around to asking about the fried chicken and our waiter apologetically made an order, realizing he had forgotten to. We were not upset at all, but he still took it off the bill. We cleaned that entire dish so quickly and I was pretty happy. The food respectively though is a bit more on the more expensive end for ramen, but it is unique and special.

I really recommend the service, and intimate space at this restaurant! It is not the most authentic, but it is definitely a gem for Asian food in Cleveland!",1
bK5nWi1oNs63utSlzmRUNg,"Ramen? Isn't the authentic Japanese ramen. Mostly, wonton soup typical. Plus, the portion for the price isn't worth.",0
bK5nWi1oNs63utSlzmRUNg,"I met up with an old friend while I was in Cleveland, and we went here for dinner based on the good Yelp reviews, and my love of Asian cuisine. Normally fusion restaurants leave a little to be desired, but I'm also not a purist who insists on ""authentic"" dishes like someone's grandma would make. 

This place in Ohio City near Platform Brewing is in a funky old industrial space, and has all the interesting architectural details that implies. They also have some interesting artwork on the walls. Only about 50 seats in the dining room, with a few at the bar as well.

We sampled small plates including kimchi balls, Korean fried chicken tenders and veggie dumplings, as well as a couple of bao. They have a decent beer and wine selection, plus signature cocktails, because this is now required by law. Everything was pretty good, but the surprise winner of the evening was the dessert, green tea tiramisu, the most fusion-y dish we tried, which had a great balance of sweet, creamy and bitter.

Prices were commensurate with the quality. Service was good. As with all of the places in this neighborhood, parking is an issue, but in the evenings you can sneak into surrounding lots for other businesses. Platform has a lot a couple of blocks away. Good place to hang out with an old friend.",1
bK5nWi1oNs63utSlzmRUNg,"Cute spot. Spacious and bright decor. It was my first time here and the waitress was happy to provide recommendations on her favorites in most popular items on the menu to try. I tried one of the flavored sake's hesitantly, as I haven't really enjoyed sake in the past. It was like a really sweet wine and it complemented the food items very well. We tried each of the 3 varieties of the delicious deep fried balls. (I forget what their authentic name was.). I also got one of the noodle bowls with pork and added a poached egg which was recommended by the waitress. It was so delicious and I had enough left over for lunch the next day. I'm looking forward to coming back and trying some other menu items. We also got these amazing little ice cream balls with a cherry sauce and sprinkling of oatmeal. Was the perfect end to the meal!",1
bK5nWi1oNs63utSlzmRUNg,"This review is for tonkotsu and spicy miso ramen only.

We were on vacation, visiting the Kalahari water park and Cleveland. I was craving ramen. I have been to Japan and had authentic tonkotsu ramen many times, and I know how it is supposed to taste like. After reading the reviews on Yelp, Google, and Reddit, I decided to try this place. The interior seemed very modern and the server told us the broth is made in house. That really excited me.

My partner ordered the spicy miso ramen (12) and I ordered tonkotsu ramen (15). We went during lunchtime and did not see tonkotsu ramen on the menu. The server told us that tonkotsu ramen is usually a dinner special, but we can still order it.

The tonkotsu ramen was a huge disappointment; the broth was halfway under the noodles. The bowl was tiny for a $15 bowl of ramen. This turned out fine as the tonkotsu broth turned out to be a watery black pepper broth, and did not have a creamy, sticking-to-your-mouthfeel. The black garlic oil had a chemical taste. I thought they were courageous to be selling this ramen for $15 on the menu!!

The spicy miso ramen was edible but it still tasted very plain. It was definitely not spicy, underseasoned, and tasted like it was missing something. I also think the corn topping was overboard as it changed the taste of the broth in a negative way (made it too sweet & corny).

We asked the server if I can change the tonkotsu ramen to something else as it was inedible, and he just offered to give us the spicy miso ramen broth. I had to fish out all my noodles and little toppings that were on my tonkotsu ramen and transfer it over. I was still charged $15 for the tonkotsu ramen even though I barely touched its broth.

Please don't call what you serve here AUTHENTIC RAMEN. I had better tonkotsu ramen from a package of instant ramen! This doesn't even come close to ones from the Jinya ramen chain in USA!!",0
bK5nWi1oNs63utSlzmRUNg,"Being a ramen addict, I have had ramen in multiple cities like Chicago, NYC and LA, so you can guess that I was excited to try one of Cleveland's top rated ramen spots on Yelp. I ordered the spicy miso and was expecting a reasonable portion for the $12 price tag, but surprisingly, it was a dinky bowl with minimal, mediocre broth. The noodles were subpar, artificial and chewy. As a comparison, for $2 more in Chicago, you can get a well-crafted, authentic ~20 oz bowl of ramen after waiting 3+ hours at a top-tier ramen spot. The bowls here are probably 12-16 oz which isn't enough for someone hungry to be satisfied, and definitely isn't worth the price tag. I was very disappointed in the portion size. 

Furthermore, the service was slow and it seemed like the staff were focusing more on the guests at the bar than the guests on the periphery. I had to request my water to be filled two times and waited on my check for almost 10 minutes. 

To further taint my experience here, after heading back to my hotel, I noticed that my urine was a highlighter yellow. It appears that another guest experienced this as well. As she correctly noted, this is usually due to a type of vitamin B added to color the noodles yellow. This explains the subpar noodles I noted.

However, I will give it to Xinji that the presentation of the dish was spot on and the ambience was pleasant. Overall, I was quite disappointed in my experience and would not recommend the ramen. You can get better portion sizes and a better experience for $12 elsewhere.",0
Bl8_M_kDXZt_zsrLRgDulA,"Absolutely delicious. My wife came from California and had to have a Polish Boy in honor of her good friend whom she met in Cleveland, John Pietras. Turns out a Polish Boy is spicy Polish sausage grilled, on a bun with French fries and cole slaw on top - believe it or not, a great culinary taste sensation! This a  place is simple but the food tastes the best- full of authentic flavor. We will try the ribs next time as they smelled wonderful also.",1
bLi48v8Div6Qm2Fyaw0C6Q,"We went last night for restaurant week, and I found this place to be just above average. 

THE LOCATION AND DECOR (ONE STAR): From the pictures I'd seen online, I was expecting more of a sports bar. The decor is attempting a more rustic interior, but everything looks too manufactured to be authentic. The layout is nice, but there is this odd extra room in the back, I assume to expand the amount of seating, but we were sitting near the entrance to it and it was out of place. I think the room is there and everything seems so fake because the location is TERRIBLE. It's in the back of the first floor of one of those ""luxury"" apartment buildings where everything is immaculate but it makes you feel really unsettled. One member of our party also stepped in the poop of one of the spoiled, sorority-sweatshirt-wearing resident's fake dogs on the way out. So that was awesome...

THE FOOD (FOUR STARS): So, I'm from out of town and not familiar with the food trucks other reviewers mentioned. What struck me as soon as we walked in was all the advertisements for all the other restaurants in the chain. There were multiple advertisements for their ""passport"" and all the other restaurants you should go to. Tacky. I wanted to eat the food here, not wonder if the chef/owner/whatever sold out (now I'm rethinking the decor...). Anyway. The food was really good. It was four stars, maybe five, but the rest of the elements of the restaurant bring it down. My boyfriend ordered off the menu, the rest of us had restaurant week meals. The restaurant week meals were fantastic. My boyfriend was disappointed by his short ribs. The tater tots and sauce were great. The cornbread was really cakey. Like, really cakey. I wouldn't be surprised if the cornbread was actually made with a box of yellow cake mix and a box of that cornbread Jiffy mix. The drinks were great, I love the consideration of using a giant ice cube so it doesn't water down the drink. 

THE SERVICE (TWO STARS): There was a ten-minute wait despite a reservation. The hostess seemed a little confused overall. A couple of us went to the bar after a couple minutes to order a drink and the bartenders (yes, more than one) practically ignored us. We waited for almost five minutes and didn't order a drink. At that point the hostess walked over and stared at us until we got up and followed her to our table. The whole thing was awkward. The bar wasn't busy, so I was pretty unimpressed before we even sat down to eat. Our waiter was really good. He was there when needed, but didn't interrupt the flow of the meal. There were a couple off moments where the service kind of fell apart, like, our table didn't have pepper, and he didn't offer us pepper for our salads (does the chef have something against pepper?). He wasn't on the ball with refills, etc. Nothing major.

OVERALL: I would love to eat that food again, but I'm not really interested in spending time, and a bunch of money, at a place that seems so corporate. If I liked that kind of vibe, I'd save a ton of money and just go to Cheesecake Factory.",0
bMSiHjs2fbKbBNPyuTwhHA,"We stopped in on Memorial Day 2018 after a cruise on the ""Goodtime III"" and it was wonderful. It was a beautiful (holi)day around 5:30pm so it was a little bit busy but the hostess got us seated almost immediately. The river views are awesome but choose to sit in the ""semi-outside"" area because it was super hot and sunny out but I didn't see a bad table anywhere in the place. Extremely friendly staff; several employees even aside from our attentive server stopped over even after our drink/food orders were in just to make sure everything was going okay at the table - it was really good service. I tend to be a bit of a picky eater but the food was delicious.... We all pretty much inhaled everything on our plates in 2 minutes lol...The tacos tasted more authentic and different (in a good way) over what you get at most of the Mexican restaurants; even ordered some to go.... Beautiful building and views, casual/laid back atmosphere, very friendly and fast staff, great food, and COLD beer!!! I would definitely recommend stopping in and I usually hate everything lol ;) Very positive experience here and seems very well run; props to the staff for doing such a great job on such a busy holiday - we hope to come back soon. Thanks again guys!!! :)",1
bMSiHjs2fbKbBNPyuTwhHA,"Coastal Taco puts out some pretty good food.  On a recent Friday evening visit, I had some drinks and ordered the Cuban sandwich (Cubano).  While I've had more authentic Cubanos, this one wasn't bad.  It was actually a pulled pork sandwich with nothing other than pork and bread in common with a traditional Cubano, but it was good.  

The pork was tender, smoky, and juicy.  The side of chips were crunchy, but somewhat tasteless.  The side of cole slaw was spicy as if it had some fresh ginger in it, but didn't taste like cole slaw.  Overall, I enjoyed the meal.

Those in our group who ordered tacos had to figure out which tacos were theirs because they were all served on one tray.  So lets say each person orders three different tacos and there are six people in your group.  That's 18 tacos.  When the tacos are delivered, they're all on one tray.  They all look alike and they're small - the smalled tacos I've seen, in fact.  Now your server is pointing and squinting at the tacos trying to discern which flavor is which.  You're puzzled because you have no idea which taco is which.  This brilliant scheme needs to be removed and each order needs to be made individually and served on a dedicated tray.  Silliness, I say!  Haven't the owners/chefs been to Bomba's Tacos & Rum in Rocky River where they do this taco thing correctly?  Bomba's tacos are twice the size and served to you on a discrete tray.

I think the people in my group that ordered tacos would only give one or two stars to Coastal Taco, but since I yelp, I knew to avoid that fiasco based on the bad reviews. I was nearly done eating by the time the figured out which taco went where.  Plus all those hands touching your food before you get to grab your tacos from the tray?  No thanks!

Great location, slow, but friendly service on busy nights.  Maybe stop in for a drink and an appetizer when it's slammed, ya?",0
bMSiHjs2fbKbBNPyuTwhHA,"We had to try this place out opening week for a Wednesday dinner.  Coastal Taco in a brand new waterfront building along the East Bank of the Flats.  The location is stellar, the patio is large, and it has a cool weathered beach house feel.  Ping pong and cornhole are set up next to the patio.

We put our phone number in and waited 25 minutes for an outdoor high-top. Service was really friendly throughout the experience.  The menu is a paper you check-what-you-want and food arrives as it's ready.  The Mojito and Margarita were both excellent although came slow.  The Margaritas tasted fresh and nothing like triple sec unlike some other Mexican joints in town.

Goat cheese guacamole with three huge tortillas and some plantain chips was a smaller portion shareable for two.  The tacos are the real focus of the menu.  Options are either $2.50 or $3.50 and are each served on a single corn tortilla.   Each taco has a main protein paired with a couple other ingredients.  I found the cod and mahi mahi tasty and good values while the chicken and pork were a little dry.  The hot sauce on the table had the perfect amount of heat.  For dessert we had the fried ice cream.  It's covered in cornflakes and cinnamon, deep fried, and delcious.

Overall Coastal Taco was a great experience.  There are definitely more authentic and organic places but the price is right and the location can't be beat.",1
bMSiHjs2fbKbBNPyuTwhHA,"The quality of the atmosphere is great, however the quality of the food was very disappointing. I ordered three different meat tacos on soft tortillas and first off, there was very little meat in each one. Secondly, there was no flavor! It was as if they used no seasoning! I also ordered chips with a flight of salsa. The chips were incredibly bland and so were all three salsas! The salsa literally tasted like water. The only saving grace of my experience was that the margaritas were solid and the atmosphere was fun and inviting on a nice sunny day. I live in San Francisco but commute to Cleveland every week for a consulting project. Maybe I'm spoiled having access to so many authentic taquerias in SF but come on guys! Tacos and chips/salsa are such easy things to get right and if you do them right, you will have a gold mine on your hands with incredible repeat business. Check out either ""Tacolicious"" or ""Tacko"" in San Francisco for inspiration. You really need it!",0
bMSiHjs2fbKbBNPyuTwhHA,"I've been away from home for 2 years and just got back into town for the holidays. We wanted to eat somewhere and decided on coastal taco. Now I've had barrio (which is pretty good) and I would say these are just as good. I had the grilled steak, mahi mahi, and al pastor. The al pastor wasn't authentic but still had a great fresh flavor. I would come back, but make sure to get corn instead of flour that was my first mistake. I loved the layout out of the building, it felt very coastal  and beach theme which I loved. In the corner they had a fire place, and on the side where we were sitting they had corner hole. It was great, we played a game while we waited for our food. It was alot of fun. They didn't have alot of people 12pm on a Saturday so if you want to experience this for yourself stop at that time. Love the place, keep it going",1
BMXeJPcosAxfLU-6baO_0Q,"Located just opposite of Cleveland State University, Pedros provide you a authentic Burrito Bowl for only $5. A lot of quantity, price & taste better than the Chipotle, it is the perfect place to have a lunch or take away if you are near to CSU.

BR7lkLeaLCZtUBvCLnltww,"Cheesesteak fans look no further!  Like the name implies, that's pretty much all these guys do, and they do it very, very well.  Just to get it out of the way early: They use cheese sauce.  I like my cheesesteak either way, but I understand there's some bad blood between the Sliced Provolone and Cheese Sauce camps.  

If you're okay with the cheese issue, this is a place you need to check out.  I'm going to assume you're familiar with the standard cheesesteak formula, but where these guys really stand out are their variations.  The Seoul Man (Korean BBQ cheesesteak) and the Lone Star (I might be getting the name wrong, but it's the BBQ/bacon one) are phenomenal.  The home fries, coleslaw, and potato salad are also winners.  

Totally unpretentious and incredibly tasty.  I've never been to Philly so I can't speak to the official authenticity, but these are more than good enough for me.",1
BR92F6HmOHq-uKtMgyr7rw,"Great authentic German food. I stopped in the other night and had the German platter. Excellent sausages, quality local sauerkraut, and service with a smile.

The beer selection here is nice and authenticate at least. Guzzle up and the food won't be so bad!",0
BR92F6HmOHq-uKtMgyr7rw,"Parking space is limited. First impression of the place feels authentic and a little dated. The server Brittany was super sweet and very attentive. The beer I ordered came about 10 minutes after my boyfriends did, which was odd. Had the potato pancakes as an app and the goulash as my entree and both were good! Would go back again.",1
BR92F6HmOHq-uKtMgyr7rw,"We found ourselves back in this neck of the woods for holiday 2011, so we decided to take another stab at eating and drinking at Der Brau.  I was happy to note that the restaurant now has a Facebook page that seems to be getting updated regularly and that they had posted and spread the word about their holiday hours, making it much easier to catch them when they were open.  

Beer is a main attraction here.  (They have a wine list too but we didn't look at it because we wanted beer.)  We ended up with some excellent Hofbrau beer and had no complaints with that, but the selections they had on tap seemed to be limited, especially since several seasonals were already sold out with nothing replacing them.  I guess this is a place where you really have to watch their announcements and time your visit to make sure you have the best beer selection.  

The menu appetizers and entrees include many authentic German selections.  We had the Wiener and Jager schnitzels, along with some excellent Hofbrau beer.  Very few restaurants can do a decent schnitzel; most of the ones I've had taste like they were frozen and microwaved.  No worries about that at Der Braumeister.  Our food was very fresh and tasty.  The sauerkraut was also excellent, probably the best I ever had.  I would go again just for the sauerkraut alone.  

I was a little disappointed in the dessert selection, which was limited to Bavarian cream (which I don't like in general), German chocolate cake (which is not an authentically German dish and furthermore tasted kind of blah), and cheesecake (again not authentic nor to my taste).  Next time I will order sausage and skip the dessert.  Also, our waitress was very young and on the impatient side, rushing us to order before we were ready and barging in on us a couple times while were deep in conversation.   I got the impression most of their customers must be regulars who know what they want without looking too hard at the fairly extensive menu.

On the plus side, the decor in this bar and restaurant is very lovely, including woodwork, booths and large German wall murals.  It was also pretty quiet, making this a nice place for a conversational dinner or intimate date.",1
BR92F6HmOHq-uKtMgyr7rw,"We ate there for the first time last night.  I had breast of duck and one of their draft beers.  Husband had sauerbraten.  We are connoisseurs of German cuisine, and this place is really good.  Cucumber salad was wonderful.  Bread seemed a little stale.  Entrees were tasty, satisfying, authentically German.  Dessert was great.  Service was friendly and prompt.  Walking in from outside: bar looks like a dive.  Needs a little refurbishment.  Three stars because it's not the Bavarian Inn in Shepherdstown MD, the ne plus ultra of German restaurants with a Michelin rating and a dining room that stuns you.  We will definitely go back to try more beer and other entrees.  We live 30 miles away but it's not hard to find.  Neighborhood looks a little dicey, so go early.",1

BR92F6HmOHq-uKtMgyr7rw,"I think I've forgotten everything I learned in my one year of German language in college.  Oops?  I realized this because Der Braumeister brings out all the lacking German in me...I heard smatterings around the bar and I even felt silly ordering ""HB"".  (Oops, that's HaufBrau).  

But that is the key to an authentic German restaurant.  It feels very European and I was especially excited about all the ethnic beers.  I didn't order food but will be sure to return, even if just for the Sauerkraut Balls.  

Sure, maybe it's on a stretch of Lorain that I don't often visit, but maybe I need to be changing that around.",1
BR92F6HmOHq-uKtMgyr7rw,"Decided to pop in on a Thursday night. Had heard this place was fairly authentic and had good food.  Ehhhhh.   Not really.

The place is run by a family from Southern Germany and is the most authentic German restaurant I've been to in the US.  It reminded me of the little local restaurants I used to go to when I was in Stuttgart.  The flavors are authentic and not dumbed down for the uninitiated.  Their Wiener Schnitzel (that's veal, by the way - not chili dogs) was amazing as was their potato pancake Reuben - YUM!",1

Der Braumeister is well-known for its selection of German as well as Belgian beers on tap and in bottles, with some American craft brews added for good measure. The authentic German cuisine is always freshly prepared and served in a timely fashion. On this day I ordered the Ratatouille Salad which is more than enough food to satisfy the hunger pangs associated with imbibing fine German brews. Sitting at the old-fashioned bar stools, you are always guaranteed to interact with the locals who are experts in German Culture. I would highly recommend an early afternoon visit, due to the extreme popularity after dark. Prost!",1

The authentic beer selection made this place receive the fourth star. the last time I visited, they had several unique Christmas/seasonal beers on tap.  Unique = not from Ohio.  

The service is very friendly and prompt.

BR92F6HmOHq-uKtMgyr7rw,"Nice and warm German style restaurant. The beer selection is the best part! They have a nice selection of European old style beers. 

The food is a different story. Overall it is way over priced for the portion size and authenticity of German food. I grew up in Germany, and the only proper plate are the veal schnitzels. 
The rest of the menu is overpriced with bad exicution. Most people do not know the difference of authentic German food. I was really disappointed by the land jÁE¤ger plate, which was a little cheese crackers and a uneven bad tasting sausage for 9$.

I can honestly say I will never eat there again. But the beer is great !",0
BR92F6HmOHq-uKtMgyr7rw,"This is a very popular spot, with a lot of regulars and an authentic German atmosphere. The beer selection was very good when I was there. Prices are fair, and the food was adequate. There are a lot of adequate places to get a beer, so for me it's all about service. On that measure, Der Braumeister fell flat on my last visit. 

I ordered a wheat beer (weizen) which was good, and my next selection was a darker beer (doppelbock). It was served literally at room temperature. I mentioned this to the server, who pointed me to a woman identified as the owner. The owner proceeded to inform me that I do not know how beer should be served, that this beer is not supposed to be ice cold. 

I understand beer very well, and I also understand that doppelbock should be served at a temperature between 55-60 degrees, not room temperature of 70 from a warm bottle. I was shocked by the rudeness of this woman and the manner in which she dismissed my concern. Others at my table had the same issue with beer from the same cooler. 

I won't be back.",0
BR92F6HmOHq-uKtMgyr7rw,"We were curious about this restaurant so we were excited to try it out for Cleveland Independents restaurant week. Boy, it did not disappoint.

Der Braumeister is what is sounds like- an authentic German restaurant. We walked in on a Thursday night with no wait and were seated right away. It's a homey restaurant...so it's definitely a cozy feeling restaurant. 

In addition, my toddler was having a meltdown and the waitress was amazing. She let him borrow a book that she had and he quickly quieted down....so I was so thankful for that. Soooooooo thankful. That's good service, for sure.

We got:
- Chicken liver dumpling soup:- I wasn't sure I would even like this, but it was really good. Not too salty and the dumplings were tasty. The soup was super flavorful as well...like it's been cooking in a stock pot for a while..
- Schweinebraten mit gemÁE¼se - the pork in this dish was astounding. It was so soft and tender...and lot of times with pork tenderloin, its gets dry and tough, but I'm not sure how they cooked it to be so tender. Even my toddler enjoyed it!
- Sweet & Savory KnÁE¶del - the dumplings in this dish was so tasty and flavorful as well

Also, as of note, if you order a beer, it's of giant portion- like the size of 2-normal pints- I guess that's what makes it authentic.

BR92F6HmOHq-uKtMgyr7rw,"If you're looking for delicious German food, this is the #1 spot! We've been going here for years as a family and this place is outstanding. The Wiener Schnitzel is the best in Cleveland in my opinion and they always have delicious home-cooked soups that are sure to warm you up in the colder months!

I personally love the atmosphere too. It is dark inside but adds a nice intimacy and old-world feel to it which is perfect for a German restaurant.

I highly recommend this place! One of my favorite places to eat in CLE!",1
BR92F6HmOHq-uKtMgyr7rw,"Out of 100s of German restaurants I have been to in th US, this has to he the best place so far...everything just so authentically done from the decor to the food.

BRsR-aCifMKcTtqX8pGtyA,"I've worked with HennaMe numerous times in the past for events, but until a recent party I hadn't been lucky enough to actually get some done on myself. And now... I'm addicted! 

I may not know a ton about henna, but I do know art and Kristina is an amazing artist. Her designs seem to integrate authentic design with a modern twist--which I love. She makes her own paste from scratch using only authentic, natural ingredients, including lemon juice, sugar and essential oils. I sat down and within mere minutes she'd created something gorgeous and phenomenal on my hand (see the pics) 

Coming from a very pale gal who tends to be OCD about her skin (no tattoos for me) I was worried this was going to be a shock for me--it lasts 1-3 weeks! But I've been obsessed--in a good way--since I got it. And now I want her to do my entire back! 

Furthermore, she gives you a card with all the info you need to know about caring for your new henna piece, including day-of care and long-lasting maintenance tips. She travels to you if need her to and her charge is by the hour. 

I can't say more about Kristina and her henna. If you're looking to get some done or even want to have her at an event, you will NOT be disappointed.",1

The sauces which are the key to different Chinese stir fry dishes are very authentic.  The hot and sour soup and the egg drop soup are some of the best I have ever had including Chicago Chinatown.  Portions are good sized and the tea is very good and not over steeped.  If you want excellent Chinese food and are in the area, it is worth the trip to get your eat in or carry out.",1
BsvCTCVG7lrzXZ68VyyIcg,"By far one of the most seamless restaurant opening nights I've ever experienced. Bravo! 

There's a buzz about this new Lago and it's made of classy, sophisticated, modern elegance and energy you can feel! Don't get me wrong, I'll always hold the charming, warmth of the old Lago location near and dear to me, but it's great to see a local business growing and evolving with the Cleveland culinary scene. 

Located in the new Aloft Hotel (which is another Cleveland win in its own right), Lago is  the official restaurant for all catering and room service in the building. And considering the delightful dishes I tasted, I seriously think the guests are lucky! The new menu boasts fresh, modern takes on authentic Italian cuisine, mixed with traditional family recipes you don't want to miss. 

When we arrived for our 8PM reservation, the place was packed to the gills with excited patrons waiting to experience the new Lago. It was a little loud and crazy, but I think as the new location excitement wears off, it will level off to a comfortable, intimate-yet-fun vibe. The service was great, not too uppity, not too lax--just the right amount of attention and talkative-ness. I think just about my only complaint of the evening would have to be the 15-20 minute wait for cocktails--which was explained to us by our server as a computer malfunction they were working on as we spoke. These kinks happen on opening nights, so I didn't mind. And when we did get our cocktails I was blown away by the clementine-esque (I forgot the exact name) one with sago. Let's just say it was my own fault for slugging it down too quickly for my own good. Also, I asked our server to bring me an ""easy drinking red with no oak"" and he brought me the most perfect wine--middle of the road price range, too! Again, great service.

On to the food: I may be biased since Italian food is probably my favorite cuisine and I've starved myself of pasta for about 4 months now--but ohmygod, yes! This is the old Lago I remembered, but even better! First, the menu looks rather large, but don't be intimidated. There's an extensive selection of cheeses, meats, olives and other antipasto to choose from that makes it look bigger than it is. I loved that they now offer smaller plates for two to share and also half orders of their homemade pasta dishes. We opted to try a bunch of lighter items and decided on the Salerno Family Meatballs (for two), Scallops with manchego polenta (for two), the chef's seasonal salad (which was big enough for two to share) and a half order of the mushroom cavatelli. 

First, the Salerno Family Meatballs are something the owners really wanted to keep on the menu and I'm so glad they did--these are some damn good meatballs. They're packed with flavor from a mix of ground meats and spices, plus the homemade marinara sauce is to die for. The two scallops were fresh, perfectly seared with a light lemon-y zest. The crispy kale and the cheesy polenta that accompanied those two beauties were also delicious. Next came the salad, which was arugula simply dressed with pickled watermelon, truffle, parmesan and was fresh, light and delicious. The mushroom cavatelli was a winner with homemade pasta and a selection of wild shrooms all dressed in a creamy, cheesy sauce that was surprisingly light! Not overly salted or garlicy, which was an unexpected plus. Lastly, since it was opening night, the Chef visited our table and brought over a trio of dessert samples, including a handmade cannoli, lemon cheesecake and my favorite, a white chocolate truffle milkshake. Yes, I'm talking about truffle, like mushroom truffles. It sounds strange, but oh dear jeezus did it work. 

A side note on parking: There is free street parking, $6 lot parking (cash only) or you can park in the hotel garage and pay with a credit card on the way out--it's super convenient!

Overall, an incredible experience that I can only expect to get better and better as we return again (and again!) Kudos, Lago!

BT7FeQ8VkpHrU9qihvGD3w,"This place is AMAZING! This is my first time here and I haven't even left the store and I HAVE to write this review! 

The owner is great and personable. When he found out it was my first time he loaded me up on samples of falafel, chicken, lentil soup, and hummus. It was all great! 

You get good sized portions for a really low cost and you just can't beat the service. I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for authentic Lebanese food. I'd choose this place over Aladdin's or sittoo's.",1
BT7FeQ8VkpHrU9qihvGD3w,"I give this place 5 stars based on the food quality relative to price. It is a very simple spot in terms of ambiance, seating area. So is Crust, and that's for pricier pizza in Tremont. The place is still relatively new and the owner is adjusting for demand. The food itself is fantastic, and other than the wings at Panini's, the only food I enjoy in West Park. The food is both authentic and hits all the marks for quality. I'd say the quality is very comparable to Taza in downtown but at $, not $$. What I'm most excited about? It's only 0.5 mi. away",1
BT7FeQ8VkpHrU9qihvGD3w,"Ok so it took me forever to find this place. My GPS took me to a dead end. I actually just went to the hospital and circled until I found it. This place is great, I subtracted one star Bc I think the menu is small. No desserts when I was there. Probably Bc the place is small, two tables and some bar chairs. There is limited parking, straight back, it's to the right if you're in front of the place.

I got the Kefta plate: So good. Crazy authentic. I've forgotten how it's supposed to taste after going to more Americanized places for so long. The meat was seasoned and cooked perfectly. The rice/salad/hummus was great. That garlic sauce is like...the best. I like to do this: spread garlic sauce on pita, then put the kefta in some hummus then dip in some rice and lay it in pita. You know it's good when you wake up the next morning and still have garlic taste in your mouth. Like a Lebanese hangover :)",1
BT7FeQ8VkpHrU9qihvGD3w,"Delicious, fresh, made from scratch food bursting with complex flavors. I had the mixed grill platter and, while each selection was good, the kefta was my personal favorite. The hummus is just amazing, so smooth and flavorful. I live close by in Kamms, and am delighted to have this authentic little gem in my neighborhood. The service was very friendly as well. Parking is a bit confusing at first, pull into the driveway to the right of the storefront, and parking is on the side toward the back.",1
BT7FeQ8VkpHrU9qihvGD3w,"This place deserves 10 stars. Hands down the best falafel I have ever had. The Shawarma, Kibbeh, Baba Ganoush were makes you wanna slap somebody good. Everything taste fresh and full of authentic flavor. As an out of towner, this will be a definite stop on my list every time I visit Cleveland. Two very enthusiastic thumbs up.",1
BT7FeQ8VkpHrU9qihvGD3w,"Super fresh and of the kind of quality we would look for when cooking for ourselves and our family.  Everything is made daily and from scratch and the owner will tell you he changes the oil in his frying vat daily which makes this the place for folks seeking an authentic falafel experience from an owner who cares and won't compromise on quality.

The meats are spectacular, always cooked by order and never reheated.  The chicken is hormone free which makes for an especially juicy, tender and soft chicken--- which makes the grilled chicken entree my favorite and something special which I know I can't get from folks who buy through the average super market.  At $6.99 this is exceptional value and worth discovering by those in the neighborhood.",1

bupMXFUaZfranBLdaVcRww,"We were recommended this place by a local friend so decided to venture out to the Tremont area to check it out. Having been to numerous sushi bars, I am always up for the next one. It took us a while to find the place since the entrance way is pretty much hidden, but the staircase and solid black doors had a nice appeal. Upon walking in, we were both stunned at the apperance, all of the blown glass attributes definitely made it pleasing to you eye. We were promtly greated and sat at a table. After that it took FOREVER to even get a drink, we got looked at many times but barely acknowledged. We ended up having to move to the bar to order our sushi. The amazing food and authenticity made up for the sub par service. The craftsmanship of the rolls and just straight up art was incredible. We've been known to always test a place out by the California roll, which I must say was rather good. We also had the signature, Ginko roll, which was huge! and the soft shell crab roll, which I wouldn't order again, if it's not tempura, I don't like fried food in my sushi. This place does not look like it is in Cleveland, we felt like we were out of town but the very modern atmosphere and was a nice break from the daily grind. We will definitely go back and hope that the servers have their act together because this place would be 5 stars otherwise!",1
bupMXFUaZfranBLdaVcRww,"Best sushi in Cleveland. Very fresh and very authentic for a Japanese sushi experience. Manager is nice, but service is awful slow. I used to eat here once, often twice a week when traveling weekly for a project. I had to stop coming because the service was so slow it took up too large of a chunk of my night. To some degree, I think this was due to preparing quality food, but too often I would see the waitress just chatting up guests and forget that other people were in the restaurant. On occasion, I have been served the wrong roll (salmon instead of the toro which I was still charged for), didn't receive my appetizers until almost done with sushi, and then never received my drink I ordered. The phone doesn't work in the evening so you can't order to-go either (even ordering in person at the restaurant for to-go takes a long time - might as well eat there if you're putting in the time to wait). 

But alas...despite all the unfortunate experiences I've had there, I still think this place deserves 4 stars. It's so fresh and delicious. Definitely the best fish you'll find in all of Ohio. I seriously debate Ginko or elsewhere for dinner whenever I'm in town for work. Unfortunately, Ginko keeps losing the battle. Although after writing this review and reminiscing about all the tasty memories I have there, I may just suck it up and make my way back.",0

bupMXFUaZfranBLdaVcRww,"Really enjoyed a recent meal here with the YELP international supper club.  The food are extremely interesting to me as I like Japanese but have not had Japanese food in a long time. They have unique kinds of Sake served cold which I had never had.  They were on the slightly sweet side and very good with hints of lemon and melon.  They are served in a wooden glass, which is square and squat.  It sits atop a plate and is poured by someone other than you and is poured to overflow the wooden glass and into the plate to demonstrate that life is overflowing with goodness and good things.  The service was really excellent.  The prices were fair but expensive and that is the only reason that I am giving a 4 vs a 5.  However, if you are out for a wonderful Japanese experience what to me had this teaching, more authentic aspect than many Japanese restaurants I have been to in the past, (although its been some years now) this would make a five star choice. Its chic, its small, and its fun.  I also observed parts of the group getting a type of unique kettle cooking I had never seen.  If you go, ask about this too. The selection of Japanese food, the cooking,(for those that were cooked)  the preparation and the presentations were all top shelf.",1
bupMXFUaZfranBLdaVcRww,"What can I say...I have eaten a lot of sushi in my life and this is by far the most authentic Japanese I have ever had.

bupMXFUaZfranBLdaVcRww,"Having lived in Tokyo for 3 years I ate my fair share of Sushi and Sasha-mi. I must say the preparation is so authentic and the food fresh I haven't been to a place in Cleveland like it.. until now.

The decor is straight out of Japan and even it being located in a basement is so authentic. If I could buy a bottle of whiskey or Sake and keep it there with my name tag on it for my next visit I that would complete the scene. While the wait staff is good I find them a little off the mark by being a bit condescending. On 2 visits my dinner companion felt as if they were a visitor who never ate sushi.  They greeted me in Japanese and when I engaged in the language, of which I am fluent, they quickly were lost and I was corrected that  my pronunciation was wrong. Minor detail- the chef knew exactly what I wanted. On subsequent visits it got better but still when one is dropping 3-400 on dinner the waitresses should really be a bit more accommodating and attentive. Then again maybe she had a bad day. I cannot say enough for the presentation and preparation of the food and the selection of Sake. I am a big fan of Sake and they have a nice selection. This place will only get better and it is by far one of my favorite places to eat I Cleveland.",1
bupMXFUaZfranBLdaVcRww,"This is a moderately tough call - I'd give it a 4 in most cities, but Ginko is the first authentic Japanese Sushi place in CLE to which I'd bring friends...  

With chefs from Osaka and Kyoto (I don't know where these two chaps trained) and two waitresses that are also nihon-jin, it hits a mite bit more authenticity than many of the other venues that purport to be shinnihon ryouri.

The vibe is a version of Tokyo hip... the colours are a tiny bit... melodramatic, but in a Dante meet Japanese Urban, this is pretty on-the-money.  With DragonBall playing in the background, and a young lady with fetching blue eyes, greeting, ""Irashaemase!""  It brings something very new that Cleveland has been sorely lacking.

Seating for 30, energy, authenticity, and the freshest sushi I've had in CLE?  Recipe for success.

Rice consistency and flavour were spot on as well as the cutting of the fish itself.  While it wasn't the freshest I've ever had, the fish preparation was excellent.

Dante... Good job.

Bravo!",1
bupMXFUaZfranBLdaVcRww,"Finally. A real sushi place in Cleveland. So happy that it's finally here!

I give it 4.25-4.5 stars. Not necessarily a 5 quite yet- I wasn't super blown away, but it's definitely better and so much more fresh than other sushi that I've attempted to eat in Cleveland and around Cleveland. It's comparable to a good sushi place in other cities (thus, my non-5 star rating), but for Cleveland, I think this is definitely a great step in the right direction. (I remember there was a sushi place on the east side of CLE where the sushi was warm. And not the right color.. after that, I gave up hope..but then, BAM, here came Ginko).

My friend and I arrived around 7:30pm. It's right next to Dante and you have to walk down a set of stairs to a door where Ginko is. (Reminded me of a speakeasy lounge in Chicago... where I'm like...oh what? I'm going down these random stairs?)

It was a tad empty, but as the night when on (past 8pm), the place filled up fast. Koji was our sushi chef, as we sat at the bar, and he was incredibly cordial and informative about the sushi, the specials, and everything. Any question we had, he could answer- and was just a cool person to chat with.

The decor is full of warm colors- definitely gave it a warm fuzzy vibe in the midst of a sushi place. The restaurant itself is rather small- but hey, it IS in a basement of all things.

We ordered the unagi foie gras to start off. It was pretty good- I had really never had the combination together, so it was interesting..and the amount that came out was a lot more than I thought! I ordered some good brown rice green tea, and it was quite the perfect match. One of their specials of the night was their mackerel- a special cut from Japan, as Koji stated. We ordered the mackerel nigiri- and it was FRESH. Oh happiness.

For specialty rolls, we got the ginko roll and the nippon roll. The ginko roll was good- it had tuna, salmon, avocado, daikon, and other things, all wrapped up in a cucumber, with differing colors of tobiko on top- so that was quite pretty. And good. The nippon roll....was... a tad adventurous for us. haha. Burdock root? Koji gave us some to try- and we liked it. Ok, let's order the nippon roll- squid, shiso, plum, root... and... I think neither of us had really had raw squid. It was rather..different. 

I think I need to go back and try the other items on the menu as well..(the food...plus the sake next time), but it's a definitely great place to bring out of town friends, as well as just a cool place to chill and get some good food. Bravo, Ginko- finally an authentic place in Cleveland. :)",1
bupMXFUaZfranBLdaVcRww,"This is the Best sushi restaurant in cleveland. chef made the sushi fresh , piece by piece each time for you, just like what authentic Japanese does . Wasabi was scraped from the root which is really fresh and aromatic!  
I really love it but it is quite expensive.",1
bupMXFUaZfranBLdaVcRww,"Dear Ginko, I love you. Sincerely, Steph. 

But really guys- the love letters aside, this place is the bomb if your hungry for some authentic sushi meats. 

This restaurant is located in the basement of Dante. Just to the right of Dante there's a small sign and a magical staircase that basically leads to Japan. Read Ginko. 

You walk into this place and it bursts color. (What does that even mean? I can't think of how else to describe) The focal point is the u-shaped sushi bar that probably holds about 30 people. Anime is playing on the tv. There's a tray of Japanese candies at the back. ""Where am I right now?!?!"" 

So then Quentin, the manager, will give you the low down on drinks and specials. This guy knows what he's talking about! Listen to him! He's always recommending the most amazing nigiri, chef's specialty, etc. Best part is that he will let you know how to eat it. ""Don't put soy sauce on that."" ""Eat the head of the fish; it's the best part"" etc. My personal opinion- the fatty tuna is always a win. 

If you're looking for less adventurous fare, their sushi rolls are amazing. Try the foie and eel roll... It's like butter. Also, I know it sounds cliche, but their shrimp tempura is one of my favorite foods on the planet. It's rolled up with asparagus! Weird, but oh so good. 

My only complaint- no cell service, so I always forget to check in on Yelp. ;)   Ginko, I had to try so hard to find something negative to say about you!",1
bupMXFUaZfranBLdaVcRww,"My husband is a bit of a sushi snob because of his 4 years living in Japan and most of his complaints when we go out for sushi is about the rice: ""too gummy"", ""too sticky"", and the likes; however, when we checked out Ginko for happy hour we ended up rolling right into dinner and stayed 3 hours ordering and enjoying everything off the menu. My husband said this is hands down the most authentic and delicious sushi he has tasted in Cleveland! The food and drinks here are so good and we raved about it so much we actually got giftcards to Ginko from our friends as wedding gifts!! It's got a great vibe and ambiance.",1

bupMXFUaZfranBLdaVcRww,"I love the service here. Every time someone comes in they greet you with a traditional Japanese ""hajimemashite""
They have one of my favorite happy hours in the city. It's a small spot, which makes it more authentic than some other sushi spots around. I like sitting at the bar and watch chefs works. It's like an art form. 

The servers are all super nice and always tell me what the best fish is. They have so many different options but I usually go with some of the happy hour rolls and then get some sashimi. It's a great date night spot.",1
bupMXFUaZfranBLdaVcRww,"Not trying to sound like a snob, but the other sushi restaurants don't hold a candle to Ginko and I'm surprised at some of the negative reviews, especially from people who live here.  If you want cream cheese in your sushi or huge ass rolls, go to one of the other ""sushi"" restaurants that cater to the basics.  Ginko is the closest thing we have to an authentic sushi restaurant. They even use real wasabi, not that gummy shit other restaurants serve. My personal favorites are Eye of the Tiger-for all you raw scallop lovers (ME!), Salmon Skin Roll, Fatty Tuna Roll (Sometimes these are only  $5!)l, Ika & Saba Sashimi and Ume-Kyu Roll.  I always go during happy hour and I have always had impeccable service.  Great....now I'm hungry talking about all this sushi-guess that means I'll be going to Ginko tonight =)",1

bupMXFUaZfranBLdaVcRww,"Where's the cream cheese?
That is the reaction I suspect many locals, used to the likes of Kintaro and Heinen's Sushi cooler, have when they bite into their first dish at Ginko.  That isn't what you are going to get here, although there is a bit of avaocado mixed into some offerings.  My date didn't know what to do when they brought the soup without a spoon.  It also isn't what you are going to pay for at Ginko.
I have never lived in Japan, but I have lived on Islands in Asia where sushi made from fresh fish and Japanese trained chefs was readily available.  You could drop Ginko into any of those locals and the quality of the food would hold its own.  Of course, it is considerably more expensive, which is reasonable considering it is on the great lakes not the middle of the Pacific. 
It would be interesting if they had dishes utilizing fresh fish out of the great lakes in combination with the more traditional servings.  Maybe they do and I missed it.
The ambiance reminded me of a level in Red Steel with less machine guns and blood.  Several mentioned the volume of the music being a problem.  I am generally sensitive to loud music in restaurants and I did not find it annoying.  I had no problems speaking with my date.  I did miss some things our waitress said.  For instance, I think she told me not to eat the raw shrimp, that she would have it fried up and returned to the table later.  I didn't catch this when she was preparing the food and I tore the head off and slurped it down happy I didn't have to kill it or feel it wriggling as I chewed.
I went on a Tuesday arriving a few minutes after 6pm and there was plenty of seating available.  30 minutes later it was full.  There are only 30 seats.  About 20 of which are at a horseshoe shaped bar around the prep area.  I wouldn't go with a group larger than 2 without a reservation.
If you are in Cleveland and want an ""authentic"" experience, this is by far the closest you will come.  I wouldn't put this on the regular schedule as it is a bit pricey.  I went in a large part b/c my date has never lived anywhere with anything resembling real sushi and thought rice, cream cheese, and synthetic roe is ""sushi.""  My bill with two tastings, the Otsukiri Omakase & Ginko Nigiri, a single glass of wine, and tip was ~$190.  There are cheaper options on the menu, but I wanted a broad selection of the menu as I was quite sure we would not be back for a while.  I would guess a full meal of two rolls + drink will set one back about $50 a plate at the low end.  I will say I have a healthy appetite and was very full by the end as was my date.  That is not always my experience at such restaurants.",0
bXGADvexLZ7sAiAuTfhYiA,"The menu and selection is typical of a corp. sports bar, nothing special or authentic. Food was good but the experience was boring",0
BXz2w3mlus0xqO_4nfA9lA,"A good Asian store, very authentic and even has the grimy atmosphere to go along with that plus a bit disorganized as well. All the signs of a real Asian grocery store :-)
The prices are low , I'll definitely be back here again.",1
C7VCIXi-Yv7MGPi_OoR71Q,"First things first -- the continental breakfast is not very good here. Coffee isn't refilled well, mass-produced eggs served with questionable authenticity of gravy. Eek. If you find yourself here on a Saturday at 1am, the front desk isn't always very helpful on where to get food. There is no room service, but you can place an order from Flannery's Pub and they will deliver to the hotel.

I found the staff here a bit strange. When I came to check in, I didn't have a reservation and it seemed like one of the ladies was in a bad mood and just didn't want to deal with it. It's okay, I understand. I have those days too. I don't blame her, but it was inconvenient to go to a wifi spot in the city, and THEN reserve the room to the online web site so that I could come back and say ""yes. I have a reservation."" Maybe they have policies on keeping rooms reserved for online, but it would have been nice if she tried harder to help me find a room. It was easy enough for me to find one half an hour later on my computer on their web site. After making a reservation and checking in, no one told me about the parking situation -- so I ended up paying more than usual. Oh well.

The rooms are nice though and the jacuzzi suite is especially sexy, despite the walls being really thin. It's reasonably priced as well. If they improved the continental breakfast here and service was more consistent (although it may have been an off day), it would be a total win.",0
C7VCIXi-Yv7MGPi_OoR71Q,"So we just left the hotel this morning and have raved about it the entire visit! The room was gorgeous and spacious with a whirl pool bathtub and kitchenette. The old hard wood floors gave it an older authentic feel to the building. The customer service at the front desk was exceptional, when we mentioned that our AC wasn't working, Kathryn had maintenance fix it that day while we were out of the room and a light bulb that blew. They assisted us by extending our stay in our room instead of us switching when we asked last minute, there was no issues with that at all. The only downfall was when we went to get out complimentary breakfast and were under the impression it went until 10 but it ended at 930 on weekdays. One of the workers came off a little rude at first when she yelled across the room to us and embarrassed us in front of everyone to tell us they were closed. However her and a few other members made up for it when they allowed to take what was left and brought us some silverware and cups that they already put away. I will highly recommend this place to anyone and I can't wait to come back to Cleveland! We had a great experience minus a few restaurants that had slow service (we attributed it to the fact they were much busier than normal to the crowd rush from the Patriots/Browns game). Definitely give Cleveland a chance, also this hotel was the perfect location! A cheap parking garage right across the street and right near great restaurants and bars!!",1
caYlxQ7kaYcUZwcqJKNyoA,"Don't judge this book by its cover.  The food will blow your mind.  Rice, beans and carnitas - so authentic and delicious.  Just wish it was closer to home.  Try the whole pig.  The skin was heaven.

Fed my family of 4 for under $30 and had plenty to take home for another meal.",1

Every single thing i have had has been fabulous. The pork is awesome and the beans, and potato balls. Honestly just eat everything. This place should be on the food channel, clevelands hidden gem. Again cant say enough you have GOT to try this place.  Staff is rushed because so busy, but always seems nice. 
They sell baked goods, but i javent ever tried anu, too full of lunch for dessert.",1

This place serves the neighborhood community. Nothing pretty on the inside, but large portions of tasty, affordable, authentic food. Most of the staff speak Spanish and English but the clientele were all speaking Spanish when I was there. Nonetheless, they were warm and accommodating",1

The chicharrons were perfectly fried and crunchy, the yellow rice was delicious. The pork and beans was a little under seasoned but the sweetness of the tostones balanced out the taste. You'll get three different meal sizes with prices ranging from $6-$12. Lunch comes with a soft drink as well. Going to try the Cuban sandwich next time I visit.",1
caYlxQ7kaYcUZwcqJKNyoA,"Wow, this place was so fantastic I had these ground beef wrapped with potatoes yes potatoes then battered and deep fried.

I give 4 stars only because the Cuban was not what I expected thought it would have tasted better it was just ok not like the other items I had.Oh yeah I can't wait for dessert tonight FLAN yes authentic Puerto Ricon Flan. I look forward to trying many other eats at this place like mofongo and the rice & beans. The locals say the best days to go are Saturday and Sunday just to give you a tip.",1
caYlxQ7kaYcUZwcqJKNyoA,"I visited after reading Dick S.'s review.  Good gravy, man, this place is amazing!

If you've ever been to lovely Puerto Rico, you are likely pining for a piragua or some of those insanely good, fried pockets of glory.  If you haven't been,  go to this bakery anyway.  The staff is really nice and friendly, and will explain and describe all their offerings. The food is authentic and made with a lot of care.  

For the love of God, please try the rice pudding.",1

caYlxQ7kaYcUZwcqJKNyoA,"Here we go again in search of a Cuban Sandwich and this place did an amazing job providing us exceptional service in a timely manner.  The Cuban is authentic , made fresh to order. We also tried the alcapurrias, and tostines, and cheese pastry.  The 45 minute drive was well worth it! Great place!!",1
caYlxQ7kaYcUZwcqJKNyoA,"Thought I'd check out the new building. Food was still authentic and good, but take it to go. The seating area is dirty and cold. Woman's room busted, the Men's room filthy, no towels and a ""present"" was left in the non-working toilet. Floors are vintage terrazzo, I can only guess they built this new cinder block building on the foundation of an old store from the 1940s. If they would just clean and buff the floor they would be so great again. The Cubano sandwich is their best thing going ... the chicharones were cold and tough. Pastries were well made and delicious. Staff behind the counter were very helpful and friendly.

IMO ... you can judge the cleanliness of a non-open kitchen (or beer lines) by how clean the bathrooms are.",0
caYlxQ7kaYcUZwcqJKNyoA,"This place seriously rocks.  The Sammies are all good, the Cuban really stands out.  I would recommend getting there bit earlier as the were sold out of many of the dishes I was craving.
The rice and beans are to die for.  I had a couple renditions of the beef stew and they were excellent.  

The food is served cafeteria style, but they have a dining room on the other side. The food is super authentic and the service was very friendly. You do not have to get the combination platters, they will sell you just the main dishes if you wish.  Welcome to flavor town!",1
CBgcKcrbN7VSoofxCsCOBA,"First visit today and I was pushed to this great little spot by fellow YELP reviews; and they didn't lie.

This is a very small shop, no dining room. The owner was present and we talked a bit. Very personable man that has a great deal of passion for his business.

He has two employees (At least that is what was present on my visit) that were fevorishly making sandwiches for either invisible guests are a ton of pickup orders. I am going to assume the later as person after person walked in, picked up an order and left. All the customers seemed delighted to be there and anxious to take a bite of their order.

With all this excitement I was not the exception. 

I ordered a Ruben and got an authentic garlicy dill pickle wedge with it which was also delicious. Forget the pickle.

The sandwiches come in like 5 sizes I think, I ordered one up from the smallest and it was a boat anchor! I mean I don't even want to know what the largest looks like.

The meat was smoky, pickled perfection with some of the best sauerkraut iv'e had in a long time. The bread was fresh and had the right amount of deli-pull to it; with a tougher but not hard crust.

I will be sharing the web site with my co-workers and I will be back for sure.",1
CbsS6VvPsIvpytUbLAu71Q,"Caveat emptor, this place is perfectly adequate by Ohio Chinese buffet standards, but not for people who consider themselves afficionados of Asian cuisine.

The place is clean and they have a pretty large selection of buffet options.  As you can read from some other reviews on here, it ranges from mongolian beef and hot & sour soup to pizza and a ham carving station.

The staff is all Asian, and one can't be sure if they actually speak any English, or if they have just learned some key words and phrases to do what they need to do for their Midwestern clientele.

It's very hard to tell the difference between some of the dishes, like the sticky sweet Sesame Chicken vs the similarly sticky and sweet General's Chicken.

Like every other Chinese buffet in Ohio, they feature a dessert section too with odd little petit fours and banana chunks drizzled with some mysterious red sweet syrup.

If you decide to eat here, go hungry and adjust your expectations to something less authentic than Panda Express.  You may love it, or you may be like me and think ""eh, it's a lot of food for not that much money.""",0
CbsS6VvPsIvpytUbLAu71Q,"At the end of my esophagus is a bottomless black hole.  

Sometimes regular meals will temporarily do the job of filling the endless vacuum, but sometimes it calls for something more drastic.

I've been coming to Oriental Palace for several years when I have an uncontrollable need to gorge myself, and in that time it has been pretty amazingly consistent as far as the food and service go, which is to say pretty good to better than expected.

The selection of items at both lunch and dinner is generally a little better than most Chinese buffets.  Lots of American-Chinese items, as well as some more pedestrian items (pizza, roast beef, etc.) for those that are scared of a little sweet and sour sauce.  

They also have a small sushi selection, and in the evenings for the dinner buffet, there will also be some more authentic items for the more adventurous (salt and pepper frog legs, anyone?).  

If you're in the mood for a Chinese buffet, it's probably safe to say you already know what it is you're getting into.  As far as these types of places go, Oriental Palace has been consistently good for years, and is worth your time to check out.",1
CbsS6VvPsIvpytUbLAu71Q,"I was debating between giving this 3 or 4 stars but decided on 3. If Yelp had the ability to give 3.5 stars then maybe I would have changed my rating. 

I visited for the first time towards the end of October 2019 on a Sunday afternoon. I came with 2 other people. We were driving from the I-X center which was about 15 minutes away from the restaurant.

FOOD -- This restaurant is known for their really cheap Chinese buffet ($5). The buffet is only at a particular day/time. Please call ahead. The selection of food is large. You can get your standard protein, carbs, vegetables, and dessert which includes fruits. I enjoyed the chicken skewers, noodles, green beans, rice, and mini donuts. I pretty much loved everything I tasted. The food is most likely not organic and probably cooked in oil (perhaps some items were fried) but for $5, what do you expect? I could also make some of the meal items at home so if you are looking for something different to eat, you may not find it here.

I plan to come back because I enjoyed my meal even though it was a bit average and it is not authentic Chinese food.

Overall, the food tasted great, customer service was good, and the price is very affordable.

ccoflrCjKB_D06Cc3vC6Ng,"This is a popular regional chain. OK food. OK beer. It's OK. There are many more pubs in Cleveland where you can find better food, better beer (more selection) and a more authentic experience. For example: Academy Tavern on Larchmere. For example: The Little Bar & Grill downtown. For example: Flannery's downtown.  Etc. If you want some wingz with the dudez, go here.",0
CDqPVVvQtVncNQGydnZy7A,"The Beachland is exactly the kind of venue that Cleveland needs.  Cool shows, cool employees and a cool bar in a cool location.

The place was originally built as the local Croatian home, so the ""Tavern"" is the old bar and the ""Ballroom"" was the event hall.  The stages, therefore, are not exactly purpose-built rock venue stages, more like a platform in the back of the room and a theater stage from a middle-school gym, respectively.  I've never had any complaints about the sound in either venue, though, and both have a great ambiance and local flavor.

The drinks are reasonably priced, especially for a music venue, and the Tavern is as cool a bar as you'll find to hang out in on the East Side, live-music-or-not.  The whole place kind of oozes authenticity that makes me wish I could come back to Cleveland for ten or twenty more shows a year.  If this place was located in Chicago, it would rank among my top five venues.

Overall, I would definitely recommend this place whether one of your favorite bands is playing here or if you're just looking for a place to hang out for the night and hear some live music or a DJ.  It seems like there's always something going on here and the entire Waterloo Arts District is cool as hell, so, also worth checking out.

Three thumbs up.",1
CJvN2k3gjR7JspTx21icTQ,"Let me preface this with the fact that I am a teenage boy who likes to eat... a LOT. When my boys and I went on a road trip and were craving pizza, we wanted to get authentic Cleveland food but also something cheap! When we happened upon Crust, first of all, the parking was super accessible. Secondly, the waitress was kind enough to inform us that everything down to the grain of wheat grown was homegrown and homemade. Third, each slice was MASSIVE. For 4.50 you could get an enormous 1 pound slice big enough to fully feed just about anyone. Cool modern atmosphere for a fraction of a fraction of the price. Highly recommend!!",1
CJvN2k3gjR7JspTx21icTQ,"Very good slice of pizza! Might be a bit too much dough( hand tossed) but I loved it. Flavorful sauce, authentic pepperoni and cheese. Fast, polite service. I only wish I had gotten a little more creative with my toppings. This was not a cheap slice of pizza, but you get what you pay for. Quality!",1
CpUfCSFoTNlZRzzz5U9V0w,"I very much wanted this place to be just on the level of Cozumel... the typical #F menu Mexican restaurant that provides loads of salsa, fast service, and lots of cheese on my tacos.

Sadly... I've received none of this on my three visits to Mexican Village.

I don't like the salsa.  It has a 'PACE' like syrup consistency to what seem like a couple of diced tomatoes and pieces of cilantro... And the tiny dishes provided are not nearly enough for a large basket of chips.  I do not like Mexican restaurants that skimp on the salsa... it seems to be a bad business m.o.... and this place is guilty of it.  Putting aside the small dishes of not particularly good salsa... the service is not very attentive and so said dish is not replenished at any sort of satisfactory rate.

I don't like the cheese.  I'm American... I like the white very finely textured cheese you get at Cozumel or any other mexican restaurant around the country that has the same menu as every other place.  I'm convinced that Mexican Village is picking their cheese out of a 'Kraft - Mexican Blend Shredded Cheese' 2 cup bag.  Please fix this.

I don't know if this is asking for too much... but it seems to be what Americans here want.... If I want something closer to authentic Mexican I'll seek out anything involving Rick Bayless... 

This place could be fantastic.",0

REALLY expensive for Chinese food though, and the location isnt ideal. The servers barely speak english, which was aggravating, but eh you win some you lose some.

cRTkev8c66o6q6v7FstjLA,"Well, this was a bit overwhelming.  The food here is decent, yes, but the problem I had was that there were so many things on this restaurant's menu that it was hard for me to pick out what was good and what was not, or even what was Szechuan-style cuisine and what was not.  

There were over 250 items on this restaurant's menu, including things that were definitely not Szechuanese dishes - Taiwanese stir fried noodles, sushi and Thai iced tea, to mention a few.  And when we asked the server to recommend something to us, she did not seem to know what to recommend herself.  We ended up ordering a griddle-cooked beef dish and a noodle stir fry, both of which tasted fine, pretty authentically Chinese, but I cannot say that for sure that it was authentic Szechuanese food.

The good news is the food tests authentic. I've spent many years living in Asia and would say this place is much better than most American Chinese restaurants. When I travel thru Cleveland I usually try to have a meal here. I've probably had about a dozen meals here and never a bad tasting meal. The only reason for not giving a higher rating this time is because of what I mentioned in the first part of my review. They should pull the offer if they are not going to honor it.",0

Szechuan Cafi opened earlier this year in the former E. 30th St Cafi space inside Asia Plaza, but I only recently became aware of them when I sampled some of their food at the Night Market a month or so ago. Encouraged by the food we tried there, we visited Szechuan Cafi for the first time about a half-hour before close for take-out.


The woman who took our order was very helpful in assisting us in choosing dishes from the extremely extensive menu containing many unfamiliar options. She clearly had full command of all the dishes and easily explained them and gave us some recommendations. In contrast to some other restaurants in the area -ahem wonton gourmet ahem- I never felt like I was being treated as if my pasty white skin were a disadvantage. Despite the fact that it was near closing, she also insisted we sit down and enjoy some tea while we waited the scant few minutes until our order was ready. I don't know what the previous reviewer was talking about - this was some of the best and friendliest service I've received anywhere in Asia town.

cuI4nkcx6d1bdG--ZM4oww,"I really enjoyed my experience at Anatolia!

Although nothing stood out to me as being out of this world, it's certainly a worthy place to dine.  I ordered the cucumbers in yogurt and hummus and pita as an appetizer for the group, and it was fresh and tasty.  We also ordered the Shepard salad, which reminds me of my travels back in Macedonia, where I ate that before every meal.  It's quite authentic and simple and certainly worth a try.

For my entree, I got the chicken shish kebab.  It was well seasoned, but not spicy and the chicken was tender and juicy.  I also tried the lamb doner, which was thinly sliced and covered in a delicious yogurt-based sauce.  As far as Middle Eastern style dining in Cleveland goes, this is a safe bet that will not disappoint.",1
cuI4nkcx6d1bdG--ZM4oww,"I showed up at this place with higher expectations I suppose, which might explain my 3-star rating.

So being that the Cleveland area lacks diversity in the ethnic-food scene, I was looking forward to some good authentic Turkish grub for a change. I forgot the name of the dish I ordered, but the mental image remains fresh in my brain: cubes of grilled lamb, an ice-cream scoop of white rice, and a small, almost like a garnish of carrots, green peppers, and onions.  Despite the simple presentation, I mercifully held off yelp-judgement until my first bite. The lamb wasn't bland or dry, that's good. White rice is well, white rice - any asian can tell you that.  And they didn't mess up salting and peppering their sauteed veggies. So the meal was okay, but my mom can make that. What made it Turkish???????? And why did I pay $17 for that?  Forget Whole Foods, I'll go to Giant Eagle and make it myself. I'll even call it Moroccan.",0
cuI4nkcx6d1bdG--ZM4oww,"In general, the food taste good. I like the red lentil soup. But the Iskender is not as authentic as it should be. The syrup made the bottom part of the dessert Baklava soft and not crisp enough. I assume it is because they made a lot and put them there, but the dishes are not gone fast. The service is extremely slow. And there were flies inside the restaurant, and it is very annoying when they fly around.",0
cuI4nkcx6d1bdG--ZM4oww,"Quite good. I like the appearance both inside and out. Anatolia's sidewalk seating adds much to the appearance of what is otherwise still a rather bleak streetscape on Lee. The food is good. It seems relatively authentic, but I've never been to Turkey. I like the donner (thin-sliced mix of beef and lamb) and the cucumber yogurt with pita. The only critiques I have are the sometimes sluggish service and the lack of options for children. Otherwise, this is one of the better Cleveland Heights restaurants.",1

The food was how it should be served in The heartland of Turkey but lucky us, they are right here in Cleveland, OH!  We had the Iskender Doner Kebab, and the Mixed Grill and I can vouch for the authenticity of them being how you would have it in Turkey, Just perfect.
For those who are lucky to be living in Cleveland, you are missing out on a jewel of an eatery if you haven't been here already. And, if you are passing by this town like I am, I recommend you give this place a chance. Food and the service that comes with it is just worth a try. Enjoy",1

It was my parents' wedding anniversary and our server, Yucel, provided excellent customer service, including treating us to chocolate mousse with a candle! I highly recommend Yucel, the sweet cheese dessert, and anything eggplant this place has.",1

Great food and a cool atmosphere!
Love the eggplant, shrimp with veggies in tomato sauce, and ke bobs.
For apps, I like the hommus, baba, and lebni.
Love the pita and the new eggplant appetizer.
Anything that you order is fabulous!!!!
An authentic Turkish gem!",1
cuI4nkcx6d1bdG--ZM4oww,"Good food, ok service, beautiful decor. I had the Iskender kebab. I loved the meat itself; it was delicious. The tomato-ish sauce tasted nicely, and the yogurt was awesome, probably one of the best yogurts I've tested, with a beautiful homemade flair. The ""croutons"" were also perfect in consistency and flavor. I've been twice to this restaurant, and I like my Iskender so much that I had it both times. The baba ganoush was good, even for me (not a fan). It was very authentic tasting,  and you could really feel that grilled flavor of the eggplant. Definitively, a must try.

cuI4nkcx6d1bdG--ZM4oww,"I have been to this place many times and I really don't see why people keep recommending this place.. Maybe because there is no other Turkish/Mediterranean restaurants in the area..
Their service is slow, waiters are very Rude. Food is not authentic and flavorless (If you have tried real authentic Turkish food in Turkey or middle east you will know what I am talking about), and very overpriced..",0
cuI4nkcx6d1bdG--ZM4oww,"My favorite Turkish restaurant in Cleveland. There is ample seating, the place is spacious and the ambience is nice. The staff is friendly, they also have free valet parking, definitely a plus in the winter. I ordered the Vegetable Stew and it was delicious - authentic similar to what I had in Istanbul. They also have Ayran - it was refreshing. The baklava was rich. The bread is super - freshly made, fluffy and warm. Overall 4 stars! Highly recommended if you are looking for Turkish food in CLE.",1

cuYl-tgIioYVp619BlmokA,"Just rolled into town and remembered that Cleveland has a strong Vietnamese community and pick this place to find out.

It was just a funny experience (the food was very good). It was pouring rain and the yelp directions emptied me into a parking lot of a Korean Restaurant? I wound up calling the place three times trying to understand where in heck I was trying to go?

Twenty minutes later my son arrived in at Pho Ha Nam and here is the deal, it is INSIDE THE ASIAN FOOD MARKET and THERE IS NO SIGN OUTSIDE!. That is all I wanted to say really. The place is perfect whole in the wall and the food was quite good and authentic. If I am ever back in Cleveland I will be sure to look them up.",0
cuYl-tgIioYVp619BlmokA,"Having lived in San Francisco for many years, and experiencing authentic Vietnamese cuisine in several restaurants there, PHO HA NAM is now the best authentic Vietnamese restaurant in NE Ohio.

Their Pho is outstanding - fresh, flavorful, and generous portions. Their summer rolls are perfecto - always made fresh with the peanut sauce consistently thick and tasty. Their Vietnamese sandwich - Banh Mi - is large and awesome. The family staff is very friendly and the restaurant is clean! And regarding price = very very affordable.

Compared to the popular and to me, vastly over-rated Superior Pho on Superior, PHO HA NAM is the more authentic and quality focused Vietnamese restaurant in NE Ohio. Check it out, you won't be disappointed!

cuYl-tgIioYVp619BlmokA,"Best Banh Mi, Pho, and vietnamese coffee in Cleveland!!! Banh Mi tastes authentic!!! And Pho taste like they were cooked with love!!! Wouldn't recommend any other Pho in Cleveland other than Ha Nam!!",1
cuYl-tgIioYVp619BlmokA,"Ambiance: Exactly what I look for in an authentic Vietnamese restaurant: hole-in-the-wall location, asian servers and customers, horrible vietnamese ballad music and vietnamese artscapes of rivers, rice patties, etc. We managed to sit next to the only dirty wall in the restaurant with dried broth splatters all over it but the rest of the restaurant was quite clean. Service was straightforward and to the point.

Food: I had the broken rice with pork chop which was enjoyable. The chop itself was decently-portioned, dried out but not tough, and actually had a great lemongrass flavor. The accompanying steamed omelet was tender and the rice freshly cooked. My dish was missing the shredded pork but I didn't really notice until I already done with the meal. The fish sauce is disappointingly thin but well-balanced in terms of sweetness and tang. I did also have the iced Vietnamese coffee which was strong, bitter, and sweet just like it's supposed to be. I wished they had let the coffee steep/drip at the table like my favorite restaurants in San Diego but at least they nailed the flavor. The process of smelling the coffee brew and mixing it yourself is just a cathartic experience I miss when they just bring it to the table mixed in a to-go cup.

Overall I enjoyed my meal at Pho ha nam. They have surprisingly good flavors, very reasonable prices, and are one of the stronger showings of Vietnamese food I've found in the Midwest. That being said, there is certainly room to improve on their execution and dining experience. I plan on coming back to try their pho in the coming weeks.",1
cuYl-tgIioYVp619BlmokA,"This is a hidden pho gem in Cleveland.  Ha Nam replaced a prior pho restaurant in the same location.   The interior is the same but the menu is revamped.  I've tried pho from the Vietnamese food Mecca of Houston, Texas and I give Ha Nam pho bo (beef pho) two thumbs up for flavor. 

They're closed at 8 pm on Friday so if you're looking to come for dinner make sure you give yourself plenty of time.  My only gripe is the cost.  5 dollars for banh mi (Vietnamese sandwich) and 8-9 dollars noodle soup is quite steep compared to Vietnamese restaurants in other Vietnamese-centric cities.  

Here's our menu line-up: 

1.  Banh Mi Thit Nuong (Vietnamese BBQ Pork) 5 dollars -   The BBQ pork is the bomb!  The lemongrass seasoning was flavorful.  The french bread was warm and soft.   The chef accidentally over toasted our french bread so it's charred black.  The french bread is what makes a Vietnamese sandwich so good.  Instead of making us another one,  the server gave us burnt bread and asked if it's alright.  We were the only customer in the store at the time.  If you want guests to come back, don't be stingy on the quality of your food. 

2.  Bun Thit Nuong (BBQ pork vermicilli) - 8.50 excellent dish.  The star of the show again is their BBQ pork.  definitely a must try.  You won't be disappointed. 

3.  Beef pho with brisket and meatballs - 9.00  the broth is on point!  It's flavorful and the star anise season really comes out in the broth.  For pho experts, star anise is definitely a must in the foundation of pho broth base.  The noodles was good as well.  The excellent flavor is dampened a bit by the overly oily broth.  The fatty oily just coats your palate.  

Here's the synopsis:  definitely a must try pho location in Cleveland.  The food tastes authentic with some hiccups here and there, but I will return",1
cuYl-tgIioYVp619BlmokA,"We had bun bo hue, goi cuon, pho, and com suon. Omg!!! The food is soo authentic!!! It's like what my mom would make!!! I love it so much that I togo some goi cuon. Soo delicious!!!!

The veges are fresh.",1

cX2Nr_XmGYlMaBW35M0sUg,"I had a very fun visit to Mabel's. The staff was friendly and the food was delicious. I'm a fan of whole-hog experiences, and the bits from less popular parts of the pig were particularly well-executed at this Michael Symon concept. 

My only complaints were (a) its neither an earth-shattering experience nor authentic BBQ, (b) the cocktails were pricey and less creative than their descriptions imply, and (c) the decor and cleanliness of the restaurant leave something to be desired.",1
cX2Nr_XmGYlMaBW35M0sUg,"Stumbled here on a Sunday afternoon after trying to get into Wahlburgers which was too packed to even walk into, I was surprised to see this was a ""Michael Symon"" restaurant, I got excited because I'm food network obsessed and love anytime there's something near me related. 

Atmosphere is more family style, cafeteria-ish, which I wasn't too thrilled about because I felt like i was eating with the people right next to me, but it wasn't horrible so it worked out. 

If you want authentic smoked bbq this is the place, everything is smoked in house, and they sell it until it's sold out, we tried the cracklins to start off with, which are served with Lawson's Chip dip....AMAZING! 

For dinner we ordered the 1/2 lb brisket (fatty) 1/2 lb pork ribs, and 1/2 pork belly. My ONLY complaint is that there is only ONE type of BBQ sauce, it's mustard and vinegar based, and we had kids with us, so it wasn't ideal. The brisket was amazing, they give you a ""burnt end"" piece as a bonus and I wish there was more!! It is a bit pricey, so if you are taking kids, there is no kids menu, everything is a-la-cart and runs between 13-15 dollars per half lb, if you want sides those are 6-7 dollars extra as well. 

Check it out!",1
cX2Nr_XmGYlMaBW35M0sUg,"My boyfriend and I came here tonight to celebrate my birthday. Lots of hype and high expectations for fantastic BBQ by one of Cleveland's homegrown chefs. Boy were we disappointed.

When we got there, they were out of brisket and mr. beef (both things we were told to try) so we decided to share the Beef Rib (designed to serve 2 or more), pig ears and sides of the potatoes, cole slaw and broccoli salad. Everything came out very quickly, we made friends with the people next to us in the cafeteria style dining room. All started off really well. 

The side portions are tremendously small. The broccoli salad is a nice riff on the usual - they added dill which is surprisingly good. The coleslaw seems to be a mix between a vinegar and traditional based slaw and it's refreshingly yummy. The potatoes that everyone is raving about? just fried potatoes. No real seasoning beyond a sprinkle of green onions.. (I don't get the hype on these at all. I think Happy Dog makes better tots and that's kind of just sad to say..) I love Cleveland Kraut but there really wasn't much on the 'plate' to make much of a statement. (if you haven't tried the Gnar Gnar kraut - you really need to!) Which brings me to the main meat here if you will - this was possibly the most disappointing part of the meal. It comes out as an incredibly impressive piece of meat but was in the end at Flintstone portion of fat. We both had a few good bites and a lot of gristle to maneuver around. 

We came home hungry enough to eat gluten free bagels that were not that great, sad to say. 

I keep hearing and reading about this 'Cleveland Style BBQ' and I have to say that is a pretty crap response. There is a lot of really great things to be proud of about Cleveland - there are some really amazing authentic food places. However, when I think about BBQ (or Mexican or Japanese or Italian..) I want something authentic. Something with roots to the 'home land' and someone in the kitchen who can cook with respect that makes you proud. If 'Cleveland BBQ' means overpriced food, fatty meat and okay sides... then that's a real bummer. There are a lot more places who represent Cleveland in a way I would be proud to bring friends, family and any one out of town too. Sorry, but we won't be back.",0
cX2Nr_XmGYlMaBW35M0sUg,"Iron chef, Michael Symon has another hit in Cleveland, this time a hip barbecue restaurant on east 4th.  Having travelled to many of the great barbecue institutions of America - Texas, Memphis, St. Louis - I was hesitant walking though the door on the authenticity and quality of the food.  Overall, I was very pleasantly surprised.  In addition to excelling at the barbecue fundamentals - Symon integrates his signature pickling talents into several of the side dishes - offering a unique twist pairing with the traditional barbecued meats.  

The restaurant it's self is best described as a mix of modern and a bit of southern charm.  Nice two floor spacious design.  

If you love bourbons, your going to love the bar selections.  For the signature cocktails, there were 3 types of manhattans alone.  The Michael Manhattan is the way to go, a bit steep on the price point, however it is well worth it - plus they give you a pretty generous pour.  One of the best manhattans I have had to date.

For appetizers, you have to stretch yourself and try out the pig parts - pig ears are delicious.  Crispy and tender, with a great spicy seasoning.  Very tasty and with the try - and added bonus is that you can brag you have had pig ears before!

For main entree, brisket is the best on the menu - would highly recommend the fatty cut.  Hands down on of the best brisket I have tried.  The home made ballpark mustard based barbecue sauce goes perfectly with the cuts of meat.  Ribs on the other hand were mediocre at best.  The ribs were pretty dry, over cooked, and not tender at all.  When comparing the 2, the brisket is definitely the way to go.  For sides, we order the greens and cole slaw.  Great job on the pickling of the veggies in the Cole slaw - and loved the fact is was not overflowing with the mayonnaise.  The combination of the pickled sides, with the mustard barbecue sauce, and the smoked meats was perfect.  

Try this place out, worth a visit.  Understand there is sometimes some long lines here - hit it up later in the night - we went at 11 on a Friday night and the place was empty.",1
cX2Nr_XmGYlMaBW35M0sUg,"Cultural appropriation by hipsters...

Delicious pickles and sauerkraut.  Ribs were okay.  Nice rub.  Baked beans were soupy and the seasoning was off.  Greens were okay but I've had better.  Cherry Coke mixed drink had the most delicious cherries as garnish. Kielbasa's texture was off (too soft) and was no Bueno.

Not authentic southern BBQ.  It was just okay and somewhat expensive.",0
cX2Nr_XmGYlMaBW35M0sUg,"Mabel's is an upscale bbq joint - their menu is reminiscent of small plates on which you select your meal entree and can add on sides. If you are looking for traditional backyard bbq, this is not your place. If you want the classy pricier cousin of bbq.. continue reading.

Your selections are served up on cafeteria-style trays, but the atmosphere maintains a swanky aesthetic. 

The star of the show is the fatty brisket. It is is TO DIE FOR...so juicy, tender, and flavorful. 

The sides are just okay. The zucchini was served cold (I would have preferred a warm dish) and the flavors all together were a bit too acidic for my taste. The spÁE¤tzle is good, but nothing compared to what you could get at an authentic German restaurant. 

Mabel's will not be everyone's cup of tea, but it is definitely worth a try. I appreciate the fine dining twist Michael Symon puts on these humble dishes that we are used to only encountering at family reunions.",1
cX2Nr_XmGYlMaBW35M0sUg,"I have sampled some really good BBQ in my life, from the Carolina's to Texas and I have to say Mabel's holds their own. We went in on a Saturday night around seven or so. There was a short wait for our table so we hung out at the bar. Sampled some of their wide variety of beer and
bourbon. While some of us chugged beer and others sipped whiskey we decided to try some Pig Ears served with authentic Lawson's Chip Dip. OMG they were awesome. If you are a Clevelander you should know about Lawson's Chip Dip. It was a great accompaniment!!
Once our table was ready which the wait was less than 20 minutes, we ordered the feast!!!
We had fatty and lean brisket, pork belly, lamb ribs,beef ribs, and kielbasa. All of the meats could not have been better. Perfectly cooked and tender. The sauces on the table were not the average sweet and sticky sauces that you find in moist BBQ restaurants. They were very flavorful and vinagery. We also had several sides that you could have easily ate as main dishes. 
One word...FANTASTIC!!!!",1
cX2Nr_XmGYlMaBW35M0sUg,"I'm from Texas, use the name Texas in describing your BbQ you need to be authentic. I've had much better from food trucks in Houston! Disappointed, and the poor server seemed frazzled. Not work a second visit in my opinion. Expected better than this.",0
cX2Nr_XmGYlMaBW35M0sUg,"I don't know where to start. I came to Mabel's with out-of-town family members because they wanted authentic bbq. This was FAR from authentic BBQ. They didn't serve chicken. What BBQ place does not serve chicken?!?!Nothing was from the grill, everything was baked and then maybe panseared for an additional five minutes for charbroiled look and taste. The sides were interesting to say the least. All of the sides had some type of pork in them. If you do not eat pork this is not the restaurant for you. They not have authentic BBQ sauce. Every table came with this weird vinaigrette brown sauce. The only things that were good were the lamb ribs although small they were good, thats it. My grandmother stated that the ribs were decent but they were missing that BBQ taste. 
Our waiter was unprofessional. After about 10 minutes waiting We Asked Him if he was our waiter and he simply replied yes. He was very minimal with explaining the menu. He was also unenthused.
Overall this is a one and done restaurant for us. Again, if you're looking for authentic barbecue do not come to Mabel's.",0
cX2Nr_XmGYlMaBW35M0sUg,"Meh... It's just ok. Pretty good food but as far as barbeque goes, Chef Symon has failed to Wow me with this project. The brisket was dry and the ribs seemed a bit chewy.

cX2Nr_XmGYlMaBW35M0sUg,This is by far one of the best BBQ joints I have ever been to. Their home made authentic sauces are to die for and the serving staff was very accommodating. If ever in the Cleveland area please stop by. You won't regret it!!,1

cXmlv2WBzuB6JLMhaCvLuQ,"Yay for the growing number of Asian restaurants in CLE! Variety is always good! This was my first time here, and we actually didn't have to wait long to be seated. Usually the place is packed, since it's the new restaurant in town. We ordered two different types of kabob, lamb and beef. The lamb was good, I liked how they packed on the spices and the meat was actually tender. The beef kabob was too dry for my taste, I probably wouldn't order that again. We also ordered shredded potatoes with Szechuan peppercorn, sour cabbage (sort of like sauerkraut) with meat, and Szechuan style chicken. The food was pretty good, I love how they have more authentic ""homey"" dishes, like the sour vegetables with meat. These are dishes real Chinese people eat at home, sorry to say....mama doesn't make us orange chicken for dinner lol. I think the only downside to eating here was the service. The staff could be more attentive, so we wouldn't have to constantly beckon them over to our table. Also we ordered a beef noodle soup, which they completely forgot about. I was a bit sad we didn't get to try it, but we had more than enough food so I guess it worked out. I'll probably be back to give this place another try, and see just how good their beef noodle soup is. Hopefully by then the servers will be more alert, and not forget to put in certain orders to the chef!",1
cXmlv2WBzuB6JLMhaCvLuQ,"This restaurant features northern Chinese cuisine. I am from northern part of China, and yes, I agree that the signature lamb kabob is authentic northern cuisine. It is the same as you would expect in a restaurant in northeastern China. The northern Chinese dishes are salty and savory. For kabobs, cumin is an essential spice and this gives the kabobs a special taste. 
However, other dishes I ordered are disappointing. I would only give 3 star for the food. However, the service is great and the restaurant looks pretty clean. Overall I'd say 3.5 star for this place. Round up to 4 star because of the service. 
I would go back to try other dishes though.

Review for specific dish
Green Bean: tastes fishy. It's quite strange when your vegetables taste fishy and there was too much garlic.
Eggplant in garlic sauce: I think they used pre made sauce for eggplant. The sauce tastes too similar to Lee Kum Kee eggplant sauce (which is definitely not authentic). In addition, the eggplant is so bland. 
Steamed whole fish: average 
Beef soup: tastes great. It's a real hassle to avoid all the carrots and green beans though.. It would be perfect if cilantro is used instead of carrots and beans.",0
cXmlv2WBzuB6JLMhaCvLuQ,"I visited this restaurant twice since it opened two weeks ago. My favorite dish is stewed pork (hong shao rou) because it is very authentic and reminds me of home.

Another dish I like is crispy and spicy zhu da chang (pork), which is another authentic Chinese dish. 

What differentiates Han from a lot of other Chinese restaurants is the fact that the dishes there are not that greasy. 
 
Typically, I do not eat lamb, because I cannot stand the smell of lamb. However, the lamb skewers they served there really impressed me. My friends ordered some and persuaded me to try. I was brave and took a risk. Well, it was definitely worth a try because the meat was so tender without any weird smell of lamb at all. Highly recommend the lamb skewers.  I got the spicy one and added extra hot pepper powder on it (love their hot pepper powder). 

In addition, the service was really good; the waitress and waiter were willing to help and cared about the customers.

Lastly, the restaurant was very clean; I had a really good time enjoying authentic Chinese dishes with friends.",1
cXmlv2WBzuB6JLMhaCvLuQ,Great food and atmosphere. Loved the lamb kabobs! Reasonably priced menu. Looking forward to going back. Might be a good idea to add a table with a lazy Susan for larger parties. Would be nice to have some authentic Chinese spices on the table,1
cXmlv2WBzuB6JLMhaCvLuQ,"The lamb skewers are a must-order at this authentic Chinese restaurant. With a variety of ""American Chinese"" and ""Chinese Chinese"" items to pick from on the menu, Hans has something for anyone. Like most Chinese restaurants, most of the items are better eaten family style so that you can get a bigger variety of flavors. We ordered the Mongolian beef, Stewed pork, sautÁE©ed string beans, chicken fried rice, and lamb skewers. The stewed pork was excellent and probably one of their most popular dishes, besides the lamb skewers. Lamb skewers can be made not spicy at all to painfully hot, depending on your preference. And the fried rice is surprisingly good. The only thing I might recommend staying away from is the eggplant dish, which was slightly undercooked the last time I tried it.",1
cXmlv2WBzuB6JLMhaCvLuQ,"I wanted to eat everything on this menu. This is not your typical Chinese takeout, though the menu at first glance is formatted very similarly to your favorite Americanized Chinese food takeout spot. Rest assured, this is an altogether more authentic experience offered at a spotlessly clean, modern setting. 

I had to stop in here after being floored by how delicious the food looked in an Instagram post (https://instagram.com/p/BL_v5RYhfyJ/) and wouldn't rest until I had it in front of me. The food absolutely delivered on how incredible it looked!

We had the boiled crispy fish fillet (get this!!!), spicy Korean noodle soup (just as good as any local ramen place), Chinese bok choy with shiitakes, and lamb skewers. I highly recommend all of it, and can't wait to try everything on the menu. I also love that they locally source their lamb. 

We called in an order for pickup, but at 6pm on a Sunday there were several busy tables. I would be happy to eat in next time, as the place is clearly set up as a nice, neat restaurant focused more on dine in than takeout. Super nice service.",1
cXmlv2WBzuB6JLMhaCvLuQ,"If you want some traditional and authentic Chinese food, this is where it's at!! I was born in China and lived there for the first several years of my life, so I can attest to the authenticity of this place :) Their most popular dish is the lamb kabobs. I highly, highly, highly recommend getting this!! Lamb kabobs are probably one of the most renowned street foods in China, so I'm really glad Han Chinese is bringing them to Cleveland :) It's $13 for 6 kabobs, which can seem a bit pricey, but it's worth the splurge! The seasoning, which is composed mainly of peppers and cumin, is so authentic that it makes me feel like I'm eating in China's night market. I also tried the Dandan noodles, one of my favorite dishes of all time. Han Chinese did a great job with this as well! It was spicy (but not overwhelming) and savory :) Make sure you check in to receive a free lamb kabob with your purchase of a lamb kabob order!! 

Pros: 
- Authentic Chinese food (finally!)
- Clean restaurant 
- Price is decent 
- Waiters speak Mandarin 

Cons:
- Slow service; it took them 30 minutes to make the kabobs even though we were the only people in the restaurant. A warning from the waiters would've been helpful!
- Waiters don't speak English very well",1
cXmlv2WBzuB6JLMhaCvLuQ,"The fam was in town, and, as standard Chinese parents, they wanted to eat Chinese. I had heard good things about Han, but had never gone, so I figured this would be a good chance.

I'm happy to say this place is Chinese family approved!

There's a distinctly northern Chinese taste to most dishes here, which you don't always find (typically you see Szechuan, Hunan, Cantonese, etc.). My family, being from the Northeast part of China, was excited by just that fact. After trying each dish, my parents would nod and say ""pretty accurate / authentic"". Mind you, I was too busy scarfing down the food to say anything, but I definitely agreed.

Some dishes I would suggest: Hui Guo Rou (twice cooked pork), Yu Shiang Qie Zi (braised eggplant), Tang Cu Tu Dou Si (Stir Fried Vinegar Shredded Potato)

Excited to have found this place as now I have a go to Szechuan place (Szechuan Gourmet) and a go to place for a taste closer to home.",1
cXmlv2WBzuB6JLMhaCvLuQ,"I guess I'm a fan.  I surprise myself sometimes.  i came here because of all the rave reviews about the kabobs when they first opened.  But to be honest, I wasn't a fan of the kabobs.  I only had the lamb -- but I only had 1 stick and gave up on it.

So of course, I had to order some of the other food off the menu to keep me fed.  And boy am I glad that I did!  Because I didn't even know that I liked it so much, until I realized that I just keep coming back!

Some of my favorites include the spicy string beans, and salt & pepper shrimp.  I've also had whole fish here, and I've had a couple of the ground pork dishes (I love wood ears and they aren't super common ingredients, so I love that I can always get it here).

They're open late, it's casual and easy.  There's never a wait, but there's always a few other tables eating.  It's a no fuss great Chinese restaurant that's authentic, affordable, and open all the time.  What more can you ask for.

cXmlv2WBzuB6JLMhaCvLuQ,"We travelled to Cleveland for a weekend getaway, and have done some research on good chinese restaurants in this area. 
The environment of this place is pretty nice. We tried to order grilled squid, but they are out, so we ordered grilled beef instead. However, we are not quite sure they gave us the grilled beef or lamb, cuz the meat has some unpleasant taste, but the waitress insisted it's beef.  We found not only the meat, but the seasoning is not quite pleasant either... Two of us only placed 1 order which comes with 6 skews, and we couldn't finish the entire order cuz of the unpleasant flavor. This place is supposed to serve good grill & kabob, however we are pretty disappointed at their kabob. 
We also ordered couple appetizers, the Szechuan cold noodle and sliced pork with garlic sauce. These 2 appetizers are pretty tasty, the cold noodle is leaning toward oily side. 
The 2 stars of this review are for the tasty appetizers. Their food are pretty authentic Chinese dishes, but definitely not a fan of their kabob.",0

I enjoyed my time in this establishment and will come again. 
I met my wife here for lunch during the week and was seated immediately. We were given roasted nuts as a complimentary snack. Drinks were promptly brought out and our orders were taken when we were ready. The food took a little longer than I expected to come out, but it was worth the wait. I had a spicy beef soup and it was excellent. Only hesitation from giving out a 5 star review is amount of fat in my soup and the bit of waiting we had for the meals.

cXmlv2WBzuB6JLMhaCvLuQ,I am preparing for a trip to Beijing and a friend who lived in various cities in china recommended this restaurant to me on account that it was the most authentic Chinese food in Cleveland. I was not disappointed. I ordered Korean spicy noodles and a fish dish and each dish was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing. The servers were extremely friendly and had great suggestions. I will never go to any other Chinese restaurant in Cleveland possibly ever again.,1
cXmlv2WBzuB6JLMhaCvLuQ,"My friends and I, who love Asian food are on a mission to find new Asian bites. We heard all kinds of things about Han, so we decided to try it. 
There were a few things about this restaurant that everyone should know. First, there is a one line name for the food you choose. There is NO description of the food or the ingredients. If you have any allergies, BEWARE. 
Second, while I love authentic places, I have never been to a place where nobody on staff had a decent command of the English language. I get it, I'm an immigrant too. However, someone must be able to communicate effectively. As diners, we were flying blind!  The staff could not answer questions about ingredients. 
My friend has an egg allergy.  We ordered several dishes that from the name sounded safe, however when they arrived, they were loaded with egg.  Then we ordered again, and the order was incorrect.  It's frustrating. 
My dishes were actually very tasty, so I'm not down on this place entirely.  However, if you have allergies or dietary restrictions, pick another place. This will be hard to navigate.",0
cXmlv2WBzuB6JLMhaCvLuQ,"Well, the name of this restaurant is a bit of a misnomer.  Quite honestly I expected actual grills on the tables or something - but the grill repertoire (3 types of kabobs, maybe 4 other grill items) was a tiny subset of a fairly extensive typical Chinese menu.

We had the beef kabobs which did not taste very Chinese to me (though apparently they are a very specific regional Northern Chinese street food).  They were seasoned with an overwhelmingly strong mix of spices that tasted Mediterranean or Middle Eastern to me (cumin? fennel?).  The meat was not marinated though - or if it was, it needed a lot more marinade.  Can't comment on the authenticity, but overall, I felt that the kabobs were overseasoned and underseasoned at the same time, and I did not enjoy them.  And at $7 for 3 kabobs they seemed pricey to me.

Now that being said, the rest of the Chinese food here is pretty authentic and good!  The beef noodle soup had an extremely well flavored broth and the correct type of noodles, though the meat was a bit on the chewy side.  The seafood hot pot was very tasty too and had a good amount of shrimp, squid and tofu.  The stir fried bean curd with pork was pretty authentic too.  The restaurant itself was also full of Chinese clientele.

This restaurant has been added to my repertoire of Cleveland Chinese options.  I'll be back.",0
cXmlv2WBzuB6JLMhaCvLuQ,"This is hands down my favorite Chinese place in Cleveland. Go there anytime, and it's chock full of Chinese people because they know this is where it's at. The menu is very authentic, and as a Northern Chinese person, there is stuff on there that you won't find at any other Chinese restaurant in town (hello, deep fried sweet potatoes with sugar glaze!!). I love that the chef does not over-season the food which allows you to taste the actual ingredients. You won't find any Americanized brown sauce (or any puddles of gratuitous sauce) in their dishes. 

Some favorites: salt and pepper squid, wonton with chili oil, noodle with meat sauce, eggplant and diced pork noodle, spicy chicken dry pot, fish fillet with black bean sauce, twice cooked pork, mixed seafood with tofu casserole, celery with dried tofu, stir fried pea pods, shredded potato with chili pepper, and their lamb kabobs. Seriously, I've never ordered anything here that I haven't liked.

Authentic, authentic, authentic. I think you'll find any reviews under 4 stars on Yelp are from non-Chinese people.",1
cXmlv2WBzuB6JLMhaCvLuQ,"I've since left Cleveland, but I wanted to leave a review for this place because I ate there at least twelve times in the last year. 

When I was in college, I studied abroad in China and ended up living there for five years. I'm originally from Cleveland, and nothing prepared me for authentic Chinese food. I ate myself stupid at small, cheap, restaurants in Beijing and Shanghai, and when I came back, it was hard to find anything comparable. Americanized Chinese food lacks the spice and tang of the real deal, opting instead of sugary, corn-starch heavy sauces. While other Chinese restaurants in the vicinity of Han do a fair job of approximating authentic dishes, Han is the best at capturing the authentic flavor while not drowning its dishes in oil.

The strength of Han is based on its outstanding head chef, who makes ordinary Chinese restaurant staples with flair and excellence. Although Han advertises itself as a kebab place (and the kebabs are really good, and if you've ever eaten chuanr off a grill at midnight in a back alley in Beijing, you'll agree with me), it's best experienced as a northern Chinese restaurant that also serves kebabs. And yes, the kebabs are heavily spiced. If you just want grilled meat, please tell them so, because in China, they pour the spice on with great enthusiasm.

I personally recommend the Dandan Noodles (dandan mian), the spicy string beans (ganbian sijidou) and the Sliced Pork in Garlic Sauce (yuxiang rousi). But everything is good - I haven't had a bad dish here.

Service is prompt and friendly. Prices are very reasonable. Clean and simple decor with adequate parking. Highly recommended.",1
cXmlv2WBzuB6JLMhaCvLuQ,"This is one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in the city! Walking in and seeing groups of Chinese diners is always a sure-fire sign that you'll be eating something authentic, and Han is no exception. Their kebabs are out of this world and the lamb is my favorite, by far. I will say that that they are sometimes served more spicy than others, so you might order them mild, if that's more suitable for your palette. If you've never had Chinese kebabs before, know that cumin and chili are the main seasonings. The menu has many other traditional soups, apps and entrees, as well. I've never left here hungry or disappointed with my meal!",1
cXmlv2WBzuB6JLMhaCvLuQ,"Another really enjoyable authentic Chinese place. I love that it features different regional specialties than other places in town. The signature lamb kebabs are nicely seasoned, but I found them a bit dry. Our other dishes were quite exceptional though. I'm looking forward to returning to try more new things.",1
cXmlv2WBzuB6JLMhaCvLuQ,Another one of my favorite Chinese places in Cleveland! I think it's hard to make dishes taste authentic but Han's does a great job. Theres a parking lot outside which makes life a lot easier. A huge group of us went here for chinese new year and  the food was all so good. The restaurant was very busy but our waiter checked on us often and was very helpful in helping is figure how much food to get. I thought their spicy fish stew in particular was very tasty! Cant wait to come back,1
cXmlv2WBzuB6JLMhaCvLuQ,"Another great option for authentic Chinese food in Chinatown! I ordered the boiled crispy fish fillet (#92) and my husband had the Dan Dan noodles.  The bowl of boiled fish was HUGE! For $20, it is more than enough to share between 2 people!  The flavors were great.  We didnt care for the noodles much, and they were a pretty small portion. 

Its a nice place inside, and there is plenty of parking out front! I will definitely be back.",1
cXmlv2WBzuB6JLMhaCvLuQ,"I had to search for this place but it was quite good. Prompt service and authentic Chinese food. I had the Beef tenderloin with mushrooms and was delighted. The beef was delicious and the enoki and shiitake mushrooms very flavorful. I will definitely try it again. It is rare to find good sauces that do not overpower the delicacy of mushrooms, yet enhance tenderloin. Simple place, yet nice service and a good meal!",1
cXmlv2WBzuB6JLMhaCvLuQ,"It is with out a doubt the best authentic Chinese food in Cleveland. The menu is almost the same as what you would see in a typical family-style restaurant in China. Nothing fancy or fine dining, but these are the real and good Chinese food. Everything there is great, except the kabobs are just ok. My favorite is always the tofu with egg yolk.",1
cXmlv2WBzuB6JLMhaCvLuQ,"I love a good Chinese restaurant. I've been a ""regular"" at Han for the better part of two years now, and while there are a couple of close seconds in the area, Han for me is the best! Quiet, friendly service, and a great menu with many different dishes aside from the standard Genetal Tso's Chicken. 

Much like many of the Asian restaurants in this area of town, you may have some apprehensions about going in at first. It can be overwhelming if not awkward, especially for a suburbanite such as myself. But I would encourage you to cast aside any feelings of uneasiness and give this place a try. There is a bit of a language barrier from time to time with some of the servers, but they will always take the time to try to understand what it is you are looking for, and they truly want to make it a pleasant experience for you. I've gotten to know a number of them over the past couple of years, and they're always eager to introduce me to new dishes.  Put yourself out there with a friendly smile, and you'll be amazed at the response you will get. 

On the menu-side of things, I can't say enough about a couple of their dishes in particular. The Korean Spicy Seafood Noodle Soup for example, is piquant with Korean spices, chunks of squid and shrimp, cabbage, carrots, udon noodles. Yum! Other delicious offerings that are a bit more toward the authentic side are the Xinjang Style Lamb (spicy ), Chongquin Casserole () , Boiled Fish in Spicy Szechuan Sauce (), and Mapo Tofu. Don't let the  scare you though, if that's not your thing tell them, and they can tone down the spice for you. 

I'm in there at least once a week for lunch, if not more. I've never had a bad experience at Han, and I often find new things, or specials to try. If you like Chinese, and care to be a little daring, Han is the place to open you up to a while new world of Chinese food.",1
cxq_iu2Zl5jm6qLGfff5eA,"I ordered from Amazing Wok II for two reasons: the positive yelp reviews, and the convenience of online ordering (and delivery). I ordered twice on two separate occasions, so as to truly give this place a chance to make a good impression. 
I found the food to be extremely hit or miss (mostly miss). I love spicy dishes in brown sauce (Kung Pao, Hunan, etc), and no matter which dish I ordered, it seemed to be in that bland, nondescript brown mystery sauce that mediocre Asian places are known for. I was very disappointed. 
The fried rice, however, was delightful. Fully cooked (nothing is worse than undercooked fried rice), full of flavor, and chock-full of vegetables, the vegetable fried rice did not disappoint. 
The nail in the coffin was the potstickers. They actually provided plum sauce instead of the standard soy-and-ginger sauce that potstickers are supposed to come with. Who are you kidding? 
I love Americanized Chinese food; no need to have an ""authentic"" Chinese menu for me to fall in love with your restaurant, but come on. Shortcuts like these not only alienate new and potential customers, but they actually piss off die-hard Asian food fans like me.",0
CzcfYhCbzPoVEgVZfOgw8A,"Let me start by saying this place is bit what I expected.     For what this place charges for a meal, you would expect your food to be hot and fresh. The waitress we had was questionable.  We had to stare her down to her service and utensils.  These people that brag on the catfish must have never had authentic catfish. On top of that the pieces were no bigger than a small 2 piece perch dinner!  The table behind us had excellent service, the waiter was VERY attentive to them. It was my daughters bday and we had to beg for water and she never asked if we needed anything. It was as if we were a burden. When you go and spend $200+ for 4 people at at restaurant you expect a lot more than the experience we received. We will never return to this ESTABLISHMENT.",0
CZjWBiv0U0UFELpJ-UDUfg,"I lived in Brazil for a couple years and went to this reataurant hoping to taste some of my favorite food from that country again.  I was not disappointed.  We arrived during brunch on a Friday.  We had a reservation, but it did not appear to be necessary as there were not many customers at all.  The food was very good.  The salad/brunch bar had several gourmet salads, pastries, soup, bread and many other options.  The feijoada with farofa were great and tasted very authentic. Our server was very attentive,  as was the gaucho who served most of the meat offerings at our table.  The alcatra, picanha and grilled pineapple were particulary amazing.  The picanha alone was good enough to bring us back again even if everything else had been mediocre, which it wasn't.  We went during rib fest and the ribs we were offered were well seasoned, but overcooked. However, the gaucho acknowledged and apologized for this.  The cheese bread and bananas provided tableside were good,  but unremarkable.  But, the fried plantains were very good.  It was my birthday and I was given a birthday dessert for free.  It was a flan and had a lit candle.  It was the best flan I had ever tasted.  We were greeted by the assistant manager,  who was very friendy and asked how everything was.  We were provided with a small bag of Brazilian candy and a coupon for a future brunch visit, which was a nice touch.  Overall, a wonderful exoerience!!",1
D3MfMrIoNV4_aXPj0bi1BQ,"Know what really creases me?  When a restaurant removes a less-than-positive review from its Yelp listing.  Who's to blame....the restaurant or Yelp?  I wrote 2 previous reviews of Lopez...one glowing (which is magically still posted) and one not-so-glowing (one that was removed) on a subsequent visit when I said their service had slipped and their guacamole was served very cold and clearly wasn't freshly prepared.  Well guess what?  Tonight was the SAME experience.  Salsa arrived at the table STONE COLD...I mean, straight out of a cold refrigerator.  Come on...get the food temperatures right.  It sets the tone for the rest of the meal.  So I wasn't surprised when the masa arrived with a flaming hot corn masa with super cold cheese atop it.  So, someone needs to get a handle on the food details.  The chicken in my fajitas was rubbery.  However, the carnitas were good.  When the server cleared our plates he dropped the fork on the top of my foot.  Accidents do happen but still... This place used to be SO GREAT about 2-3 years ago, and it has slipped tremendously.  I think they must have gotten a new manager over that time period.  There is some gray-haired due who insists on serving all the food.  Perhaps it is him.  And yes, we were told when we sat down that they are NOT a Mexican restaurant but rather a South American restaurant.  Tell you what Lopez...how about you work on your food execution before you have the balls to tell me how to classify your cuisine.  Gee, I wonder how long this review will stay posted...in the meantime I will be eating at Momocho for upscale Mex and Villa y Zapata for authentic Mex.",0
D3MfMrIoNV4_aXPj0bi1BQ,"I went to the restaurant on a Tuesday night for an event. I didn't know how pricey the food was prior and once I looked at the menu I decided just to get two appetizers which were the fried green beans and the calamari which I don't really consider ""Mexican or Spanish"". Once I ordered the food came out pretty fast. The have an extensive beer selection and also margarita and other drinks. I was also pleasantly surprised that there was free salsa and chips on the table along with water. The salsa seemed to be homemade and authentic and that made me very happy.  My only complaint was the green beans and that was because they were all stuck together after they were fried. Otherwise my calamari was a delicious blend of sweet and spicy.",1
D3MfMrIoNV4_aXPj0bi1BQ,"Before I touch on food, I have to recognize Lopez for excelling at a more noble dining pursuit.  That would be serving tequila.  Lopez really has one of the more comprehensive tequila menus I've ever come across and certainly the most I've seen in Cleveland.  I'd definitely recommend trying a flight of tequilas sometime.  Since a good tequila is the key stone in any good margarita, Lopez serves up an excellent one here.

Fortunately for me I can walk home from here.  Others may not have that luxury, so I'd recommend that they invite at least one friend who doesn't enjoy partaking of fine libations and slap them with DD duty.

Oh yeah, concerning the food. This isn't a Mexican restaurant, so if you have your hopes set on high for authentic Mexican, keep looking.  It's more of a modern-southwest-fusionish menu. While I really love the enchiladas here, I'm also a huge fan of their crab cakes.

The service is alright here, nothing to write home about, but I've never had a bad experience either.",1
D3MfMrIoNV4_aXPj0bi1BQ,"I have been here about 5 times over 18 months - here are some of my impressions of the place. 

This is my place to go to for wonderful margaritas!  Pricey, yes, but I don't think there is any other place nearby that you can get such well made and unique flavored margaritas.  Plus, you can get them half price during happy hour (Sunday-Thursday).  I never thought I would get a Hibiscus margarita in Cleveland.

As for service - it can be a little too attentive at times.  There was one time the owner or manager visited our table 3 times to check in.  But, I can appreciate that he is concerned with customer service.  My favorite server is Terry.  He is very considerate and excellent at what he does.  A wonderful guy!  The hosts have never been haughty to me, as other commenters have experienced.  They all are pretty young, but friendly.  I am not a fan of the valet, and think it is kind of funny.  But, you know what, I just don't use it.  I park across the street in the garage.  If someone wants that kind of high end valet experience, they can have it.  

Foodwise, I like the place, but it does not knock my socks off, especially at the price point.  BUT, lets face it, Cleveland is not THE place for Mexican/Tex Mex food.  As for me, I love Mexican/Tex Mex street food and have had the fortune of living where the good stuff is.  DO NOT come to Lopez if you expect authentic Mexican street food.   Lopez offers a more inventive approach to this cuisine.  I would even say that they offer food to a more bland palette, which, in my experience, is consistent with the clientele of the area.

I enjoy their calamari as it is very well seasoned and not fried.  I enjoy most of their tacos too, although often they are underseasoned.  The lobster taco was just ok.  Again, it just wasn't seasoned enough, so it tastes like nothing. I appreciate their flavor combos of their tacos, just wish their were better seasoned.  Their enchiladas are good too.  Again, my socks are not knocked off, but it is the best I have found in the region.

So, while this place is a little spendy, you get wonderful drinks, a nice ambiance (bathrooms need an overhaul, though), attentive and copious staff, and good unique food.  And, if you want, you don't even have to park your car.  A solid place in the neighborhood for me.",1
D3MfMrIoNV4_aXPj0bi1BQ,"We went once, and that was once too many. I don't mind the wasted money, or the pollution done to my mouth. A good margarita could have cured that. But bad drinks are also part of their shtick. No, what bothers me the most was the wasted time. If I could have that back, I'd give them a second star just to be civil. 

You'd have more chance of getting food that was authentically south western or mexican at a Long John Silvers. When they finally let the food police out, this place will get cited for nasty fraud.",0
D3MfMrIoNV4_aXPj0bi1BQ,"Lopez has weird hours to me. It may actually be the case, but it seems that way. I think the bar opens at 4pm, the kitchen at like 5 then the kitchen closes at like (i dunno) 10 then the bar stays open. 
It's odd when you're there eating and enjoying the bar and then all of a sudden there are chairs upside down on tables. If something makes you feel like you should ""get out"" it's that.

OK so anyway. There is apparently a happy hour. I know because I was there at this time (which I'm not completely convinced was any particular time) and my friend said, ""It's half off tequila."" You would NEVER know this. It's not on the website, the bartender didn't mention it. I didn't see a sign. Maybe I'm a fool, but I think not.

The food is tasty. I'm vegetarian and the mushroom quesadilla is what I  recommend. My meat eating friend got the same and loved it equally. The margaritas are well made. I know my margaritas and these worked their purpose. There's a lot of tequila to chose from and a fairly decent take on a Mexican menu.

The one thing you may want to consider before trekking to Lopez is that this is not an authentic Mexican menu. It's more Americanized than some may like. Maybe more revisions Lopez! We don't get many Mexican joints in Ohio, hook us up!

So try Lopez for some kinda Mexican food and drink tequila while you're there, maybe then you won't care about the non-Mexican choices.",0
D3MfMrIoNV4_aXPj0bi1BQ,"I have also been here twice so far.  The 1st time was super fun, sat at the bar during happy hour (1/2 off all tequila which is amazing and the cucumber margarita was super tasty), and then transferred to a table outside.  I got the mahi mahi tacos and they were very fresh and clean tasting.

Then I went back on a sunday (also a happy hour day) and got a god awful margarita (just the regular kind), seriously undrinkable and the mahi mahi tacos again, but this time they were like swimming in oil.  They waitress was super nice and could see that something was not right, mistake I guess, a bunch of oil spilled on the plate and fixed things for me right away, but the tacos weren't the same as the last time.  Oh well, I would definitely go back, not the most authentic mexican, but serves it's purpose and if you are jonesing for south of the border type food they could semi-satisfy your craving.",1
D3MfMrIoNV4_aXPj0bi1BQ,"Lopez has the potential to be great.  Unfortunately its hard to think of a reason to go back because:

1) if we are craving mod mex- we would go to momocho which is similarly priced (maybe a lil bit more) but offers higher quality and more original food (in my opinion).

2) if we are craving true mexican flavor we would just got to mi pueblo taqueria (on lorain) which has great authentic tacos, etc.  


-The mojitos were decent, however when one combines cheap rum with mint it inevitably tastes like mint flavored medicine.  

-Their house salad was delicious- appropriate portion, unique and tasty. 

-Their steak enchiladas were more like an enchilada-fajita hybrid- which was fine b/c the ingredient quality was good (steak tasted like steak).  

-The sage/bluecheese/bacon guac was all that it was made out to be- delicious.

-Tequilia list was expansive.

All in all, might go back again b/c their salad was really good and just to try more menu options.  Also, although we didn't dine in there- it looks like they have a fairly large area that would be conducive to parties which might be worth taking advantage of.",1
D3MfMrIoNV4_aXPj0bi1BQ,"Very surprised with my latest trip to lopez.  I don't understand the 1's at all.

I will put it in context - my girlfriend and I walked in at 9:45 on a Friday night... things were slowing down, but we called ahead and they said kitchen is open until 10:30.  We sat on the patio, which is wonderful.  We both ordered margaritas - she had a pineapple, I had a traditional golden.  We both ordered enchiladas, Chicken for me, Steak for her - and we split a side of the jalapeÁE±o grits.  I was blown awa",1
D4h0fi8uVj62nkffV7Impw,"My boyfriend visited from out of town, and we came to Ohio City BBQ to get ribs. We ordered a full rack of ribs, with fries and mac and cheese. The ribs were fantastic, as well as the fries! The mac and cheese was good too.  We loved the whole vibe of the place; the whole restaurant was very clean and well kept. The owner came out and talked to us for awhile, and he seemed very genuine and passionate about his restaurant. The price was very reasonable as well for what we ordered. Between the two of us, we paid $30, and got an enormous portion that we were able to take home and eat later. Would definitely recommend this place for authentic barbecue and a friendly vibe!",1
D4h0fi8uVj62nkffV7Impw,"The perfect new lunch spot when you're craving comfort food! Ohio City BBQ offers a variety of bbq sandwiches, platters, ribs and delicious sides. The brisket was by far the best, and the sauce was great! I would say the brisket is equally as good as Mabel's but at a lower cost.

You can order for pickup online, eat at one of about twelve small tables there, or get it to-go. Our food didn't take long at all when ordering for lunch on a weekday. The atmosphere is very rock 'n' roll oldies-style, very laid back and chill. Service was friendly and helpful.

Here's where I'm docking a star: I think the sides here are perhaps not in-house recipes. My suspicion may be due to the fact that I saw a man carrying a dozen huge cans of Heinz baked beans into the back room, and the mac and cheese wasn't anything special. Ohio City BBQ, remember that sides are also a great way to shine! I'd love to try some authentic baked beans or a twist on your mac and cheese, even though I know they aren't your staple products.

The store is still getting inventory in, so drink choices were minimal. I think this place would probably be best having a soda fountain, and maybe even some house sweet tea. And beer. I know, I'm greedy.",1

d9fHu9xEmCDs9ShFIWEMZw,"My brother and I was in town for Easter weekend 2018.  We ordered the Goat n Rice, Vegetarian n Rice, both came with soda - total bill under $20 (to go).  As authentic as it gets.  We live in NY, and it's rare to find great food outside of NY, but this place is definitely AWESOME!!!!",1
d9fHu9xEmCDs9ShFIWEMZw,"This past summer, a friend and I went on a road trip that started in Cleveland. It also marked the start of our world tour of food - as we ate different ethnic foods, starting off with African. 

Driving thru the suburbia, I drove right past this place - there should be a picture of the front of this restaurant in the dictionary for the word nondescript. Just follow your GPS instructions. 

Lots of parking when we arrived as we got there less than an hour before their scheduled closing time. We were the only ones there though they had a steady stream of carry out business. Call before going because several items were already out and some are only served on certain days. 

We shared an order of the seasoned rice with tender chicken, which also comes with a fresh salad. The pics don't capture the portion size. I'm saying it was huge and if you know me, you know I can eat. So can my fellow fatty friend, but that's off topic. 

I enjoyed the vegetables as I always have liked the way it's served in the African cuisine. The chicken was blackened a little too much for my taste, however, it wasn't so bad that all I could taste was char. I should have taken a profile shot of the dish as you can't see how high the food was piled on. The rice, the stew, the greens and the beans. They all complimented each other as I just mixed most of it (less the greens) to have a little bite of each in each spoonful. 

It's not table service as you order, sit and wait until your food is ready. Self serve station for utensils and water. The inside doesn't look like much and it's definitely not suited for large groups - but look past all that and enjoy some authentic, delicious African cuisine. In Cleveland of all places.",0
dAn1MqXl4pghfeXx3XFRaQ,"I love Bruegger's Bagels, another east coast based company that reminds me of home.

This location is inside the Cleveland International Airport in Concourse C and I make sure I hit it up when I can even though I am usually disappointed when I make my order.

Since this Bruegger's is located in the airport, seating is more open to other restaurants as well as this place too. The area is typically clean, just depends on the time of day I guess.

The workers never seem that happy when taking or making orders which is not typical for a Bruegger's Bagels but I chalk it up to it's the airport. Lol

The bagels never seem to be stocked. I have yet to order specifically what I would like to order, always having to settle for something else. Very disappointing. They never seem to wipe off their knives when using different spreads either which sucks. They have Pepsi products by the bottle as well as out of a fountain and various juices/milk for drinks.

Overall, it is an ok location to pick up bagels or a sandwich as long as you are not expecting good customer service or what you came here for originally. Come in with low expectations and you will be fine.",0
dCsW_fmSz_DiotoRIjh3jg,"I don't think this restaurant is open anymore. Is this correct? I went here a few months ago with some friends. I found it to be just average. Ordered the vegetarian couscous and it was under-flavored. it didn't seem very authentic to me - more like bland food for midwestern palettes.

I did like the beef moroccan cigars though - appetizers are always delish!",0
dCsW_fmSz_DiotoRIjh3jg,"Went to Darna for dinner last night and was pleasantly surprised. I haven't had much experience with Moroccan food so I can't say how authentic the meal was but it was delicious for sure.

I'm going to preface this with I had a $25 gift certificate from restaurant.com when I visited (80% off sale!). The server was prompt and kept bringing warm grilled pita bread for appetizer and along with the meal. I got the Berbere stew which is a tomato based stew that is loaded with shellfish. The tomato was not overpowering and it was really good. I had them add some couscous to it to give it a little more body. My bf got the stuffed quail which was prepared well and slightly sweet from a honey glaze. We both had enough on our plates for lunch the next day. For dessert we got the White Chocolate Peach bread pudding which was good but not the best i've had. 

All in all a good meal but when we got the bill with the discount already included, this place might have to be regulated to once in awhile if I don't have a gift certificate to help out.",1
dCsW_fmSz_DiotoRIjh3jg,"I never thought I'd see a Moroccan fusion restaurant, let alone a Moroccan fusion restaurant in Cleveland.  This was the first time I had ordered monkfish, and it tastes a whole lot better than it sounds (Monkfish? Am I eating something ascetic?).  It's true what they say in that it is the poor man's lobster, since the texture and taste was remarkably like lobster.  The flavors of the dish itself were well balanced, and the meal was very filling.  Eating here though does make me wish I were eating  the food from Tajine, a Moroccan restaurant in San Francisco which sadly is closed now.  It was here that I first had superb authentic Moroccan food.

Service was attentive but not overly imposing.

Oh and you HAVE to get the bread pudding.  Best bread pudding I've had in a long time!

OK so I just looked up what a monkfish is on wikipedia, and all I have to say is, what the hell is that thing? I ate that??",1
dcytjy24XmYrLtjTjgyEZA,I rarely give any place 5-stars but Rocky's is so good it deserves it! The atmosphere is authentic Italian and very cozy! The wait staff is nice and the food is delicious. I dined with my niece and we got the Saturday special: an X-Large 2-topping pizza for $11.95. We were surprised when it came out. It was big and had thick crust. The pizza was cheesy and tasted like no other pizza I've ever had! I'd recommend getting meatballs on your pizza - Outstanding! You could taste every ingredient in the pizza! The prices are reasonable. Such a great hole-in-the-wall joint. I would recommend to anyone visiting the Cleveland area!,1
ddlnpDxGDDxGGoG_dVXwiw,"In short, the food at Felice is exceptional.  The kitchen delivers a unique mix of New American home cooked meals with a high end spin, and some  where mixed in there is a collection of authentic international cuisines.   Probably the only place in Cleveland you can have a mix of fresh shucked oysters,  homemade empanadas (yes, empanadas!), ribs and chicken, pierogis, and a seafood stew all in one sitting.  The kitchen has something for everyone. I can say Felice arguably has one of the best ribs, fried chicken, and empanadasI have tried in northeast Ohio.   This place is worth a visit.  

The environment of the restaurant can best described as a cozy ambiance similar to a traditional Irish pub.  Walking in to the restaurant, you would never expect the menu options it offers - I was already mentally prepared for a draft beer, pub burger, and a side a fries - when the menu was handed to me, I was in sheer awe at the number of different selections available - and honestly a bit skeptical at their ability to deliver.

Drinks - Lots of different signature cocktails available, but as a traditionalist, went with my standard manhattan.  Well done.  They have a lot of different fusion cocktails as well.  

Appetizers - Went with a wide range of options to try out as many selections as possible, the fresh blue point oysters were very fresh and had a great pairing with the home made mignonette.  We also tried both the beef as well as the mushroom empanadas.  Both were exceptional and one of the best I have tried - perfect balance of crispy and tenderness on the outside skin.  The inside filling was very flavorful.  Brussels sprouts were also very nicely prepared with a nice balance of sweetness with the raisins and bitterness of the vegetable.  The mushrooms with slices of break were also tasty.  The only appetizer which we were a bit iffy on was the octopus.  The octopus was not your typical preparation-it was small baby octopuses with head and tentacles together- not your typical preparation.  Not a dish to be ordered if you are not an adventurous eater. 

Foe main entrees, we went with the Asian inspired barbecue ribs.  Hands down, one of the best ribs I have ever had - they should take this recipe to the annual rib cook off.  Sauce was nice an tangy and the meat texture was fall off the bone tender.  Perfect amount of charring in the outside for that extra flavor.  We also ordered the Mac and cheese - not your grandmas Mac and cheese.  Hybrid spin with cranberry topping and interesting texture.  We also ordered the fried chicken which was amazing.  Great seasoning and crispy outside.

Overall loved the restaurant.  However, the menu and environment may be confusing to average diner - there is a wide range of food options and there is not a single cuisine that prevails - this may be the reason for lower customer volume at this time....Give it a try, the menu is not what you expect, and the rib, fried chicken, and empanadas are worth it!!  Truly a hidden gem!",1

DG2bc26AWHUaPedrcQUNqg,"Great stick to your ribs soul food! 

This location is in the Lee Harvard Shopping Center around the corner from Villa. The restaurant itself isn't much to look at, just a short counter and small dining room with a handful of tables but that doesn't matter because the fried chicken is amazing! It's just like Gladys and Ron's in Atlanta! It's moist and tender and not too greasy. You can get it in dark or white meat, thighs and legs or breasts and wings. 

Besides fried chicken Angie's offers catfish, whiting, tilapia, perch, salmon croquettes, shrimp, beef tips, pork chops, oxtails and beef and short ribs. Some of the sides offered are black eye peas, cabbage, yams, mac & cheese, potato salad, green beans and collard greens. Everything is fresh! Nothing is canned. Their waffles are outstanding as well! The only bad thing I can say about Angie's is that their cordbread muffins are a little dry.

The restaurant itself was pretty bare. Customers don't linger either, they order their food at the counter and wait for it to be prepared then leave. 

Insider tip: Make sure to ask for some hot sauce for your fried chicken. They keep it behind the counter. While Angie's fried chicken doesn't need any condiments to be savored, the house hot sauce adds a welcome kick. 

Bottom line, For quick, inexpensive and authentic soul food, you can't go wrong with Angie's Soul Cafe. While you can order the same food at various fast food restaurants, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by not visiting Angie's first!",1
dN0GBmRHgxFPCWtejNkKbw,"Last weekend I had visited Cleveland with a few buddies of mine and after a day of traveling, we were  definitely craving some homey Korean food. Living in in the NJ/NY ""K-town"" area, we wanted to check out one of Cleveland's Korean restaurant scenes to compare and quickly found Hansol. We ordered a few bowls of soondae gook,ojinguh (squid) bokkeum, and some Korean BBQ to share. 

I found that the broth of the soondae gook to be deep and savory while not being as oily or greasy as the broths I'm usually accustomed to finding at the Korean restaurants back home. I could taste the ""authenticity"" in the the soup which was impressive.

The ojinguh bokkeum was spicy and wasn't rubbery in texture or flavor and the BBQ was very delicious! The meat was given with a sauce that was AMAZING!!!  It was such a great compliment to the BBQ and tasted even better in the lettuce wraps that came with our meats.  A nice surprise that we received with the BBQ was a complimentary steamed egg omelette which was a nice touch and definitely appreciated (I love my egg omelette).  The one thing that I was hoping for was some garlic to grill. I probably could've asked but was too preoccupied enjoying the rest of the meal. 

I found the menu options and prices to be quite reasonable and was glad to see the variety of dishes (and soju) that was offered.

The staff was very welcoming and friendly and the service was very quick. If ever you're in the area and looking for some quality Korean food, I'd definitely recommend Hansol!",1

Reminds me of someones grandparents basement. The kind where they have one of those bars where your their grandma likes to make people drinks. Except this one has really good mexican food. And margaritas that look a lot like lime Kool-Aid.  It's almost the same green as the stripes on the outside of the building.

Don't panic when you get there and try to open the front door and it's locked. You are supposed to enter through the rear of the building by their tiny parking lot.

dQwjYLmQXb06CpMPIpm5-g,"One of all time favorite and best Mexican restaurants in Cleveland. The food is a homemade and authentic as can be and tastes excellent. Affordable as well. Homemade red salsa with a kick and chips to snack on while you wait. I always get the large combo, 2 tacos and an enchilada with whatever meat you want, rice and beans included for a great deal.

The food is good, but not great...better than a Mexican fast food place but not as good as other ""authentic"" Mexican restaurants.

I know some reviews rave about the mole sauce but again, to my taste it's good but not something I'd cross town for.",1
dQwjYLmQXb06CpMPIpm5-g,"I talk about this place to everyone who loves Mexican food. Alot of places can't come close. The food is always good, the portions are great and it's worth every penny. It's so very authentic. Love it Love it!!",1
dQwjYLmQXb06CpMPIpm5-g,"Excellent restaurant!  Some time ago I lived in the Cleveland area for a few years, and while there had the good fortune to become familiar with Villa Y Zapata on the west side.  Now living in another state, on my infrequent visits to Cleveland I often try to return to Villa Y Zapata for lunch or dinner.  I find that it has consistently offered the best authentic Mexican dining experience in Cleveland or anywhere else!  The food with its high quality and ample portions is the primary draw.  A wide range of selections are available from a variety of styles, each with its own merit.  The enchilada and flauta dishes are particular favorites of mine!  Be prepared to take leftovers home.  Service is low key, yet friendly and accommodating while being attentive but not overbearing.  The current facility is neat and clean and comfortable, quite appropriate for the nature of the business; very colorful, too.  There should be no problem finding it at the corner of Madison and West 85th Street!  Adequate secure private lot parking is available behind the restaurant, with driveway entry off West 85th.  I look forward to future dining opportunities at Villa Y Zapata!",1
dQwjYLmQXb06CpMPIpm5-g,"i cannot believe there is only one review of this place before mine. seriously. 
this is the best mexican joint in cleveland. 

the building itself is fantastic. It is painted in green, white and red strips resembling the Mexican flag. It's awesome!!!

The margaritas are killer. The best around, and they are neon!

Vegan/Vegetarian friendly. It's a great place to take visitors for some authentic Mexican. The prices are decent, the portions are huge. 
I LOVE the wet burrito. All the burritos are good. The vegans i know love the veggie fajitas or the bean burritos (no cheese). 

I don't have any ""dancing with the stars"" stories to add, but if it's your birthday, you should totally go here. You get to wear a sombrero and have your picture put on the wall. You also get a fantastic ice cream dessert.

I love Villa. Forever.",1

Having lived in Mexico City for many years, I can say that this is the best Mexican cooking north of the U.S. Mexico border.  The chiles rellenos cannot be beat.  The guacamole is made fresh and is fabulous.   Chicken enchiladas and the soup are the best.  Always consistently delicious.  Service is top notch.  Price is reasonable.  What more can you ask for?  Just don't fill up too much on the delicious table salsa and chips",1
dQwjYLmQXb06CpMPIpm5-g,"This is seriously the finest Mexican food in Ohio. I have been frequenting this establishment for the last 20+ years and nothing can beat the quality of food. There was a change in ownership about a decade ago, but everything is just as wonderful as it has always been.

I make it a point to bring friends here and they are always impressed at how good and authentic a good number of the selections are. The standout dish is the Chiles Rellenos. This is by far the best I've had outside of Mexico and SoCal. 

Other highlights are the sopes, tinga poblana, shredded beef tacos dorados and their cheese enchiladas with mole.",1
dQwjYLmQXb06CpMPIpm5-g,"This is possibly the best authentic Mexican restaurant in Cleveland.  Don't be put off by the divey look of the exterior, which is a red, white, and green-striped brick building on the corner of Madison and West 85th.  This is a family operation, with the family living above the restaurant (or so I think).  I forget where in Mexico the family came from, but they brought all the wonderful flavor of home to Cleveland.  It's very much a mom-and-pop restaurant that is unpretentious and low key.  Here you'll find not only the ""typical"" Mexican fare like burritos, flautas, etc., but also more authentic dishes with mole (a rich sauce) and other things.  Everything I've tried in both categories was fantastic.  Guacamole is super fresh and delicious too.  Nice selection of Mexican beers.  Villa y Zapata has been in business for close to four decades--an amazing feat when it comes to restaurants.  They do so by serving every meal as though you're their special guest. I keep going back and am never disappointed.",1
dQwjYLmQXb06CpMPIpm5-g,"my honey will probably kill me for posting this review, as out favorite spot could become compromised in some way by perhaps an influx of business preventing us from getting our favorite booth right away....BUT, as a business owner, i understand the importance of good word of mouth and i LOVE this place.  I am no foodie, in fact, if my parents or close friends even caught wind of the fact that I, Danielle DeBoe, am writing restaurant reviews, they probably would just not believe it and maybe even fear for the business, but that said....it is a mexican restaurant, family owned and operated and while i cannot speak to whether or not its the most authentic or more innovative or more anything than any other mexican restaurant, i can say with the increasing number of mexican restaurants popping up around town, we still come here once a week...(this or Luchitas's which is also a favorite).  Their margaritas may be glow in the dark green but they sure are tasty and the chicken fajitas or enchiladas ( the only things i ever order) are delicious.  if it is quiet enough you may even get special commentary by the staff on the spanish version dancing with the stars, which is sure to be on during a visit.",1

We will be back.",1
dQwjYLmQXb06CpMPIpm5-g,"I have officially found a great (and now my favorite) Mexican place in Cleveland.  Salsa is fresh, guacamole is made to order, and the food is downright awesome.  Small little place with a few seats at the bar and a TV.  Lots of pictures of folks wearing sombreros, celebrating a birthday.  Don't let the outside of the building fool you.  It looks decrepit and like it could blow over in a stiff breeze.  Park in the back and walk in.  The cheese enchiladas are the best I have ever had.  And the wet burrito with chicken (real, shredded chicken) is killer.  Their mole is every bit as good as what I had when I lived in California.  Portions are super generous, too.  Lady who works there adds to the charm and authenticity of the place and she has a warm, welcoming smile.  Clean bathrooms to boot.  5 stars all the way--no wonder it's been in business for 39 years.",1
dQwjYLmQXb06CpMPIpm5-g,"Take out or dine in, these ladies know what's up when it comes to authentic Mexican yummies. 

And by ladies I mean the last time I ate there the owner and her daughter actually came to our table to make sure everything was delicious! We ordered too much food and couldn't eat it all (pretty big portions here, folks)--they noticed and were worried we didn't enjoy ourselves. On the contrary! We were gluttonous and left full and happy. But I appreciated the attention--and the fact that they offered to take some of the food off our bill, which we politely declined--after reassuring them everything was awesome, of course.

This is not a fancy restaurant by any means. It's definitely a little ""hole-in-the-wall"" ish, but not nearly as bad as some of the diners I've been to. Sometimes your arms stick to the tables or the menus, but the food makes up for it. Also, I hear some complaints about the area, but I've never had a problem. 

My guy swears by their chicken taquitos, but I'm always trying something different. Their chicken burrito is great, I love their salsa and really I haven't had anything I didn't like here. Take out orders are usually ready in under 15 mins. And some might gripe about only one or two free baskets of chips and salsa before they charge you, but come on. Think about what you're complaining about. I'm sure you'll see you sound silly. Two FREE large portions are more than enough, and it's not like they have that limited for large parties. 

Also.. they have a parking lot. Free, ample parking is such a nice luxury!",1
dQwjYLmQXb06CpMPIpm5-g,Was expecting an authentic experience after seeing all of these reviews. Nothing about the meal or drinks were authentic.

Server was friendly. She appeared to be the only one around, though, so a few refills went missed. Otherwise she was prompt and courteous.

Food - Two Stars
I was eager to try self-proclaimed ""authentic Mexican food"" in the nearby Detroit-Shoreway neighborhood. As an appetizer for the table, we ordered ""Mexican guacamole."" Someone in the back went crazy on the onion that it overwhelmed the dish. That was ok with me bc I don't mind onion but if you hate onion, you'll hate this dish. One in my party ordered fajitas. Flavors were on point there. I wished I had gotten that. It was served with flour tortillas and beans and rice. And another got a guisado bistec which is a steak dish with beans and rice and it was all too salty for her. I ordered a super greasy pork and potato dish with red sauce. It was OK on the flavor, nothing special, but it was heavily greasy. 

Value - one star
Compared to other local ""authentic Mexican"" restaurants, this place is pricy. Pop for two (other had waters) and the dishes above plus tip were $60+. And what we had was not worth $20/person. Additionally, the item which prompted me to write this section is the nickel and diming. To be fair, it's all on the menu but still irked me. Only one refill on fountain drinks and extra cost for chips.

Atmosphere - Two stars
While it has its own lot, it fills up fast. So you have to park on the street if it's full and that area is a little sketchy.",0
dQwjYLmQXb06CpMPIpm5-g,"TL;DR: the food was good but nothing special. Wife (Mexican-American) and I were confused why so many people were calling it 'authentic' - take it from my wife, this place was nowhere near authentic. Even judging by the low bar we set for Cleveland, this place didn't come close. They tried to pull a fast one on us for dessert and it really soured the entire experiance.

 I'd heard such great things about this place that my wife and I were excited to finally try it out a while back. We decided to go in for an early dinner around 5:30 on a weekend. When we arrived, we were impressed with the menu. They had nectar!! I was thrilled to finally have guava nectar at a restaurant. Now if only they had horchata.

The food was ok, good but nothing to write home about, until we got to dessert. My wife got sopapilla, which is her standard go to dessert. It was okay - what I've come to call ""sopapilla"". Most sopapilla in the area looks like cinnamon sugar tortilla chips, while sopapilla is normally made to be puffy (and normally is square/rectangular though not always) so the center is light and airy. I can live with that, as it's par for the course in the area. 

But my fried ice cream ... Was not fried ice cream. It was a scoop of plain vanilla surrounded by four ""sopapilla"" on the plate. It was essentially sopapilla a la mode. When I clarified with the server if thia was the fried ice cream, she confirmed. I was pretty stunned. I've had the dish everywhere from LA to Chicago to DC to Cleveland.  I knew it wasn't fried ice cream and have no idea if this is what they pass off as fried ice cream or if the person working couldn't make it (in which case, please just tell the customer. There's no need to serve me something I don't want and insult my intelligence). 

I'd recommend if you want a quick dinner or lunch cheap and arent looking for anything super authentic. I wouldn't recommend for service nor for dessert.",0
dQwjYLmQXb06CpMPIpm5-g,"One of the BEST authentic Mexican restaurants in Cleveland.  We've been going to Villa y Zapata for 20+ years.

Try the Chile Rellenos, Tinga Poblana or the piping hot Fajitas!  The margaritas are pretty fantastic as well.

drecpkFkgxAuvSglTIo9wQ,"My first Walnut Wednesday experience and it was kind of cool to see all of those food trucks together and crowds of hungry downtowners waiting to order.

I had the Korean BBQ tacos, and I'd have to agree with Jason V.'s review. It was decidedly average. I wasn't expecting authentic kalbi, so I guess I wasn't disappointed. The meat was somewhat dry with only a faint taste of the godlike Korean BBQ marinade. I am not sure I got hoison sauce in mine, and if I did it was very little. The cucumber kimchi also only had a faint taste of authentic kimchi, which just left me wanting the real thing. The best thing about it was the corn tortillas, which were mouthwatering and had that delicious grilled corn flavor that just tastes like summer. The problem was that it was so flavorful that it overpowered everything else at times. I am no chef but I feel like the following changes could knock this one out of the ballpark: a stronger kalbi marinade, a more potent kimchi (and maybe cabbage instead of cucumber), and maybe a flour tortilla instead of corn.

The wait wasn't long at all, which was likely helped by the masses being lined up at the other trucks. Maybe there was a reason for that. I would probably try this truck again, but definitely not the Korean tacos. They get points for at least being creative.",0

I've read some other reviews, which skew what this restaurant truly is and does.  The menu is tailored to the masses, which is a smart move since at the end of the day, this is a BUSINESS in the suburbs of Cleveland Ohio, therefore, do not expect Tex Mex like you would see in Texas.  However, the owners are super-friendly, and clued me in on an interesting weekend tip that I have yet to try!  When I ordered the Mexican street tacos recently, I asked if they had lengua and other more ""authentic"" meats, and they confirmed no, so I ended up getting carnitas, chorizo and steak for my meats that day but the employee on the phone did inform me that they DO serve lengua on the weekend!  Curious what else they have on the weekend that they don't serve on weekdays, will need to try again and update my review.",1
dWShECwk4R1cQhzOzJXtIQ,"This is quite possibly the best Mexican street food on the east side of Cleveland.  I have been searching for this type of authentic Mexican food for years.  My personal favorite is the Torta which is not even on the menu.  I have sampled both the hard and soft tacos during the taco Tuesday special and they are both done well.  The salsa is to die for, smooth and just a little spicy from the fresh jalapeÁE±o peppers that are finely chopped into the mix.  The service for takeout has been prompt with a call ahead order and you even get a bag of chips and a nice serving of the salsa as a bonus with the order.  Muy Bueno!",1

dWShECwk4R1cQhzOzJXtIQ,It's what I expected. Good Americanized Mexican food. I had the Carnitas dinner. VERY tasty. Moist but not too fatty.

If you want to feed the family while you suck  down a beer or a margarita this is the place. Friendly prompt service too.,1
dWShECwk4R1cQhzOzJXtIQ,This is probably one of the best Mexican restaurants I've been to. I'm from New Jersey and I came to Ohio to with my boyfriend to visit his friend. I got the authentic Mexican steak tacos and he got the arroz con pollo. We also got the queso fundido as an appetizer which is amazing! The arroz con pollo actually comes with the cheese sauce drizzled over it. The bar owner is really nice and welcoming. Definitely a place I will go back to whenever I come back to Ohio.,1

The four of us really enjoyed our meals and again mine was authentic as when it was Mi Pueblo, so not complaints.  Crowded and good service.  Going with a four since they stepped up on a busy night and look forward to going back.  

Not Mi Pueblo but still a gem for all of us to enjoy!",1
dyiNt5ZTQQsLpX3Vt-hWng,"This isn't the standard generic Americanized Mexican food. You'll probably figure that out once you see beef tongue tacos or goat stew on the menu. While the interior/ambiance is a little rough/lacking, if you're looking for something more authentic (I guess it depends on your definition/version of authentic) you should be in luck. There's lots of interesting menu choices that sound fantastic.

Good service and parking lot in back of building.

I had the Cubana torta and it was delicious. The salsa was good as it had a bit of heat. Unremarkable guacamole and tortilla chips. 

I want to return to try out the tacos and some of the specialties.",1
e_W6Q-qOHcUR5ZKrwvC2qw,"a few things to say about this place.

1)  there is nowhere on earth that rice would naturally be that shade of yellow/orange.  crayola is even scared of that.  with rice so bright it possibly glows in the dark, you have to wonder what it does to your insides.

2)  so this is cleveland's china town district, huh?  only 600 square feet?

yeah, comedy would have been just writing that last sentence.  and that's it.

don't come here if you want some authentic delicious asian cuisine.  but if you're out and about and want something fried and chinese like, this is the place.

felt a little dirty, though.  i'm just sayin.  but you don't want to think about that as you're picking up your to go order.",0
e1RcTvtihmYdf8At7hLgRw,"Came last weekend after hearing what an anomaly it was to have a Casino right in the heart of Cleveland.  I figured it was a must see, so my bf and I stopped in after dinner. 

The casino itself is beautifully crafted, with fun odes to Cleveland and Ohio in general, but also a luxurious Vegas vibe with well lit bar and VIP areas, stages, and more.

Gambled a little and wasn't having much luck... the slots were no where near as loose as other Casinos I've been to in San Diego.  Maybe I am used to that vibe, because I really didn't hear a lot of ""fun stuff"" going on.  They had a promotion drawing for electronics and the announcer sounded bored over the speakers. Oh well...

My bf and I signed up for their players card, at most casinos we have been to (other than Vegas Casinos), signing up for a card will offer some type of free play or promotion.  Not here.  The lady taking care of us promised we would receive emails about these types of things...but being that were were only visiting it didn't matter. 

We still made the best of looking around and playing a bit. I thought it was pretty cool to have a casino in the happening part of town, as most casinos in San Diego are on reservations out in the boonies. 

I've experience better mostly because, I did not appreciate getting grilled at the front door because of having an out of state ID.  I do realize that it is their job and the integrity of their casino rides on making sure no one underage gets in, but instead of scanning my ID, the lady in front felt the need to inconvenience my bf & ask for his ID again so that she could compare them detail by detail.  

Sorry lady, they are not the same ID because the CA drivers license was redesigned years ago, and mine is the ""older"" design.  The fact that door staff would not be trained to know that and make me feel awkward before I even step foot in the establishment definitely turned me off.  It was only until I offered to show her my passport that she deemed my real, authentic CA ID passable.

Hey, I guess I should just take it as a compliment that I look youthful, ha!",0
e1RcTvtihmYdf8At7hLgRw,"Ohio's first casino! So here's the thing... if the horseshoe casino was in Vegas, it would probably be a 2.5 star. But compared to the Montreal casino, this place would be a 5 star. Compared to MGM in Detroit, I'd give it a 3 star. Therefore, I ended up with a 4 star. 

I am pleased with Ohio's first casino. I expected this place to look dull and tacky on the inside,but they really did a good job making it all classy. So here's my full review:

Casino(3.5)-- the good is a tad small. It's about 2 floors tall and probably takes forever to even play at a table. I tried to get in on a Saturday and although the wait didn't seem to bad, we left because we didn't think it was worth it. Finally came back Sunday lunchtime and got in without a wait but it was just packed at every table. Slots were empty though! Overall though, this casino is built really classy and I'm definitely coming back to gamble soon!

Sunday brunch buffet (3.5)-- I recently went to the Montreal casino buffet and paid $26.. & it sucked. When I heard the Horseshoe casino Sunday brunch was also $26, i was expecting some really crappy food. But guess what? It's not bad! There's different sections-- Asian, Shuffle, Desserts, American, Italian, Salad, & Carvery. Here's what I think about each section:

Asian (3.5)-- The broccoli & beef was really delicious, so was the seaweed salad, stir fry noodles, cha su, and kimchi. Amazing huh? The Asian food was fairly authentic. However, i felt like it was missing stuff like spring rolls, dim sum food, and maybe sushi. The most disappointing part was one of the dish was General Tso's Chicken. C'MON horseshoe casino, REALLY?

Shuttle (4)-- this section features just random selection and it was surprisingly good! The pork and potato hash was great. 

Desserts (4)-- So many selections! It was great! I wish there were more cakes though. 

American (4)-- this was cool! They had small baskets of fries, some sliders, it was really pretty darn good. 

Italian (3) -- I was at the italian area every second to eat as many mussels as my stomach could hold. Only upsetting part was there was only 1 pasta selection. 

Salad/ Carvery- (4)-- Decent with many different selections!",1
e43cDdpfYKn3PLDq5T2AyQ,"I think Rion down there is confused. This place is on the border of Slavic Village and Newburgh Heights on Harvard. The new menu is good, great ambiance. Hard to find a place this nice and clean around that neighborhood especially one that serves quality food. It's a traditional ""bar food"" menu but they have daily specials like potato pancakes and meatloaf that are more of a home-cooked style meal. Must be doing something right as it's normally packed for lunch during the week",1
e99T6GFJZKebgG3qO9i6Pw,"If you love the movie, then you will love this small museum and the replica house.  I can't say I'm as big of a fan as most. This is wholly due to the 24 hour marathon that TBS runs every year...it just runs the movie into the ground for me.

Anywho...the house was really pretty amazing, as the owner has done incredible work to make the house look as close to the real house in the movie - including forking out some serious cash for authentic antiques.  To be honest...I'd live in that house today if I could! The house is the actual location where outside scenes were shot, but the inside was actually used very little for the filming. 

The tour guides are well versed on the history of the movie and it's actors.  The small museum across the street holds some artifacts from filming and shows more of the local landmarks featured in the film.  Next door to that is the gift shop, which had a lot of great gifts for the Christmas Story fan, including your own leg lamp!

I would definitely recommend stopping in if you get the chance...it's a great way to get the Christmas spirit flowing any time of year!",1
e99T6GFJZKebgG3qO9i6Pw,we stopped by today. There's a great gift shop and a small museum that has a few artifacts from the movie. The actual house itself is in nice shape and is identical to this day. However once inside the tour guide tells you that some of the film wasnt shot in that house and that its basically replicated inside with what used to be there. So its not even authentic items. That was pretty disappointing. They do let you go around and take pictures in each room. Parking is terrible but one of the neighbors sells parking on his property for $5 a car. It was nice trip down memory lane.,0
e99T6GFJZKebgG3qO9i6Pw,Awesome tour and museum of one of my top two Christmas movies. It stay authentic to the movie and can touch and play in the house. Our tour guide Paige was awesome and knowledge about the movie and the spin offs of Ralphy.,1
e99T6GFJZKebgG3qO9i6Pw,"Im aware the outside was the only piece used in the movie, yet I love doin' the drive by each X-Mas and seeing the beautiful, glowing Leg Lamp. A house, diagonal across the street built a clear, plastic box protruding outside of their upstairs window, containing a replica of the leg lamp. After my visit, I go home and watch the film. 

I hear its pricey and like I said, its not even the actual house the movie was filmed in, so I refuse to go in and make contributions to the place. Outside is the only Cleveland memorabilia as far as im concerned.

Regardless your outlook on the authenticity as to wether you go in and visit, or just give it a drive by. Check it out!",1
e99T6GFJZKebgG3qO9i6Pw,"The Christmas Story House and Museum is a cute & inexpensive holiday excursion. There are currently four buildings, the gift shop, the house, the museum, and a bed and breakfast. 

-- Gift Shop --
The gift shop is filled with shirts, jackets, blankets, lights, foods, and just about anything you could possibly imagine from the movie. You'll have to purchase a tour ticket at this shop to visit the house or museum. 

-- Tour --
The tour is $12 per person and lasts between 50 minutes and 1 hour. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable on the area, various trivia about the movie, and the involvement of the Cleveland area in the movie. He guided us in to the house, gave us some information on the filming and the significance of the house, then set us free to roam the house and take photos. 

The interior of the house was not actually used in the filming of the movie, which was a bit disappointing. However, the bedrooms, bathroom, living room, and kitchen are filled with props to match the movie set. It's very similar. It was a lot of fun to roam the house and reenact some infamous scenes with the props. Die-hard fans will notice some glaring inconsistencies, such as the fact that the basement doesn't exist. The back yard was used to film the robber shootout scene, which is neat! The front exterior of the house and the surrounding streets were used as well. 

The museum is in another house across the street. It's filled with authentic costumes, props, and memorabilia from the movie, including one of the real Red Rider guns used in filming. In the garage of the museum house, they have the Oldsmobile used in the movie and a small fire truck from the kitchen fire scene on display. 

I went on the tour two weeks before Christmas, on a weekday during the afternoon. It was very crowded (about 50 people on the tour), which can get pretty cramped in the small houses. 

-- Stars --
-1 Star due to advertising ""The Real Christmas Story House"" then being told nothing was filmed in the house after buying a ticket.",1
E9OP8TODswMcmTEGXE1C_g,"Okay, so I'm from Pittsburgh and I've talked a lot of crap on Cleveland pizza, because I've had multiple pies from places with super high ratings on yelp, urbanspoon, etc. and they've all been TERRIBLE.
However, on our last trip to Cleveland, my fiance and I were looking for something to eat at around 1 AM (a concert ended later than expected,) and we somehow ended up calling Guys. We ordered a cheese pizza and breadsticks from the menu on their website, not knowing what to expect. When we picked it up, I parked in a spot on the street, and he ran in to get it. My eyes almost popped out of my head when I saw him walking back to the car, smiling ear to ear, and carrying one of the biggest pizzas I've ever seen! We had no idea it was going to be that huge, because it wasn't expensive at all! 
When we got it back to the hotel (it just barely fit through the room door,) we were even more surprised to discover that it was DELICIOUS as well. If you're from New York City, you might disagree that it's an authentic ""New York Style pizza,"" but that's what I'd consider it. The slices are big enough to fold, and everything about it was perfect. The breadsticks were also incredible.
Thanks so much for restoring my faith in Cleveland pizza! :)",1
ebgu1HjoE5S45U7oKyq4sw,"This place is a Cleveland classic. This spot offers THE most bang for your buck. Prices are low, atmosphere is authentic. The St.Louis ribs and Santorini wings are where it's at, meaty, original rub, and they make all of their own sauces. They also have great beer specials and taps. We have our family party every year in the Argus room, the owner is very accommodating and nice. The menu has a classic diner feel, but also has items such as an unbeatable deal for the Friday Fish-Fry. The Tick Tock will always be a big, wonderful piece of Cleveland to me.",1
ebgu1HjoE5S45U7oKyq4sw,"Tick Tock draws some of the best crowds of any bar. There is a lot of weirdness. If you are looking for an authentic, weird experience in Cleveland, Tick Tock is where it is at. Places like Austin, TX and Portland, OR claim to be weird or pride themselves on it. Tick Tock is really weird and wants to be normal. 

The picture that Steve L posted says it all. A dude straddling over another guy with his knees pinning the other guy's arms down and his crotch in his face. That is the physical manifestation Tick Tock. It is like Marty's dance quintet in Big Lebowski. His ""cycle"". 

There is a superb Youtube video of two drunk girls fighting in the daylight outside Tick Tock on Clifton Blvd:

efHe6rDqTs0cVINNmqDRvA,Pretty damn solid team shop. My home team or not. If anyone remembers what it was like and how small before they remodeled. It was only one floor and really cramped. Ton of helpful and friendly staff. Huge scoreboard in the center. They usually have specials during each game (Monsters too) of certain items. I was lucky enough to attend game where they had buy 1 get 1 free item. Grabbed a pair of authentic team shorts and grabbed the city version FOR FREE.  Again look for specials and clearance items. Ladies and kids section on second floor along with the Cleveland Monster hockey gear. They also give military discounts which is solid by me.,1

eoJfl5vG7X87QhcKb0nt5Q,"There is no authentic German food like this place ! Straight out of Germany , gives to a look into life that makes to forget time ! Great food , kinda pricy but for the amount of food that you get it's worth it in my option . The beer ... oh the beer ! It's everywhere and pretty good .",1
eoJfl5vG7X87QhcKb0nt5Q,"It kind of feels like you are walking into a school cafeteria, but I don't mind it. I guess that's an aspect of German restaurants. I came here in December so no one was sitting outside but it looks like there is plenty of seating outside for the warmer months. I like that the waitresses are in costume. It helps authenticate the experience, as much as you can in Ohio...  Menu items are a little pricey but they have good deals on beer. A large stein was about $5. Soft pretzels are a must! Parking is tricky. You either have to park at a metered spot on the street or valet, as with most places downtown.",1
eoJfl5vG7X87QhcKb0nt5Q,"I'm into Hofbrauhaus. it's exactly what I expected it to be, though I hadn't originally realized it was a chain & feel a little disappointed to learn so. I hate to be a snob, but that makes me less inclined to give it my patronage.

That said, who can resist massive glass mugs of beer, massive Bavarian hot pretzels, & the kitsch of servers clad in ""authentic"" German dress? I've never been here for live music, so I can't speak to that experience, but I'm a fan of the high ceilings, bright lighting, & cozy atmosphere. I'm also a fan of their karoffelpuffers, more commonly known as, you know, potato pancakes. Also? Gimme all your spÁE¤tzle. *heart eyes*

I also like that this place is HUGE, though that never seems to prevent there from being a very, very long wait - which I suspect is due to the subpar service, which is always far slower than it ought to be at such a behemoth of a restaurant (especially a chain). I also wish it were in a more desirable part of town, but there's ample parking nearby, which is a plus, & it's the sort of place where you can camp out for a few hours & make a night of it.",1
eoJfl5vG7X87QhcKb0nt5Q,"The overall experience of the Hofbrauhaus is one that will keep you wanting to come back. 

I've been here 3 times now and am planning a 4th trip.

First time- I was part of the Lincoln Park Pub Santa Crawl and we stopped here. We waited outside for a few minutes and the manager let us up to a private room where  a polka band was playing. It was a beautiful room, they did an excellent job with the interior of this space!

The second time I brought my parents in after a Lolly the Trolley tour. It was the most fun I'd seen them have in ages. They both climbed up on the beer hall bench and clapped along with the crowd. As I swung by beer back and forth, Mom was reminded  of her youth- the polkas, the accordion. 

Service is always great and prices are fair. The food is delicious and I enjoy the authentic menu. I can't wait to try something new.

I wish they took reservations for a large group, but we're gonna try to get all of us in anyway! Check it out- you'll be glad you did!",1
eoJfl5vG7X87QhcKb0nt5Q,"Last night was my first time coming here and it was fantastic! Your definitely paying more for the experience (food is very average). I suggest you get here early on the weekends or expect a 3 hr wait. The atmosphere is really what your going for. Live band, people standing on tables dancing, and SHOT SKIS!

Food quality wasn't authentic by any means but not horrible. I got the breaded pork cutlet with sauerkraut. Big portions but expect to pay around $14-$24 per entree. If I went back I would just drink and eat the appetizers which were good and not too pricey. If your with a large party and looking to go out and get hammered...this is the place to experience. Not recommended if your trying to go out and have more of a quiet night out. SHOT SKIIIIIIS!",1
eoJfl5vG7X87QhcKb0nt5Q,"Won't do it again! Made a reservation, arrived after some of the other guests. The hostess told us they were already there???? Great, thanks, didn't bother to tell us where they were seated or direct us to the table, had to find them on our own. Find our party - they've been there 10 minutes, no server has stopped by to get them drinks or greet them. 
Everybody is here - server takes drink order for 8, doesn't write anything down - only half of our drinks show and half of those are wrong??? Any server worth his salt, should be able to take an order from an 8 top without writing anything down. Server starts his litany of apologies. I suspect (correctly) that this will continue throughout our dining experience, Takes over  30 min to get drinks - I know what's coming. After drink issues are solved, one guest requests H20 -takes another 15 minutes. 
Flag down exasperated server, request to place order - out of several items that are standards, such as sauerbraten???. Now we have to ask for cutlery. Dinners arrive in a moderate timely manner. Wouldn't have seemed so long if it hadn't taken an hour to get drinks.
Food is moderate a best. Advertised as authentic German - nothing near what I experienced in Deutschland. Embarrassingly bad! Kraut & mashers were ok, potato cakes were deep fried, onion rings were overcooked on one side and under-cooked on the other. Schnitzel was not pounded to normal standard and over-breaded. Food was appropriately salted, but no other spices detectable. This place seemed to be the MickeyDs of German food. 
Beers were the highlight, Might go back for a drinking binge, but will avoid the food and hope  can get served. Service was absolutely HORRIBLE !",0
eoJfl5vG7X87QhcKb0nt5Q,"Went there last Sunday.  The food was excellent and very authentic (from someone that lived in Germany).  Except the Black Forest was the lesser American version.  Would have been 5 stars, but it looses points for service.  To be fair, other tables had great service, we were stuck with an inattentive waitress.  We had to flag down our waitress and ask for refills and order dessert.  When our son's cheeseburger came sans cheese, she didn't have it refired.  They just brought us a slice of cheese.  I would eat there again, but would demand different server.",0
eoJfl5vG7X87QhcKb0nt5Q,"I am so happy that the Hofbrauhous opened again in Cleveland. I have been to Hofbrauhouses around the world(The one in Munchen Germany) and in the United States. 
I also lived in Germany 8 years, and my father was a chef in German restaurants. Needless to say, I know what good German food is. 

The actual place is huge, with plenty of beer garden tables and booths. The beer garden outside adds way more seating and it is a lot of fun during summer hours. 

The food is my favorite part. I have not eaten at a better German restaurant in the United States, then the Haufbrauhous. The menu is vast and very original with perfect execution. Prices are expensive, however the quality of indigence and the preparation of the dishes justify the price. 
All the Schnitzel dishes are perfectly done, it truly reminded me of eating in Germany. The apps are great and awesome to share with friends or a date. I would recommend anything on the menu. 

The beer selection is legendary. They make their own beers with German brew-masters and old purity laws. Some might think the liter beers are over priced, again the process and quality of the beer makes up for the price. 

The staff is great! Very helpful with the menu to people that don't know what the food is. Fast service with a smile. It can get very busy, but the staff handles the crowd perfectly. 

I gave 5 stars because of great food, authenticity, and service. The only complain I have ( really nitpicking) is the location. Sometimes people in the area with ask for money, and the area can be dangerous late at night.",1
eoJfl5vG7X87QhcKb0nt5Q,"Food was authentic, says my Polish friend who lived in Germany.   Service and drinks were also great.",1
eoJfl5vG7X87QhcKb0nt5Q,"Having been to the original Hofbrauhaus in Munich, I probably had too high of expectation for this location.  Like others have already said, you don't come here to eat the food.  In fact, it gives German food a bad name.  I wouldn't consider this good German, more like German-American fusion.  Everything was fried and greasy.  Having finished the plate of food I was serviced I sorely regretted it the next day with all day and night trips to the bathroom.

OK so we know the food is bad, don't pay the premium for it.  The beer is great and as I heard is actually the only authentic thing about this Hofbrauhaus.  Be sure to get reservations, otherwise you are looking at an hour and half wait.  The atmosphere is great and there is plenty of fun to enjoy with friends and family.

Visit the original Hofbrauhaus for good German food; visit this location for drinking with your buddies.",0
eoJfl5vG7X87QhcKb0nt5Q,I have come here several different times for special occasions and we absolutely love it every time. The beer is super fresh the food is authentic and the scenery and atmosphere is really something fun and unique about this establishment. The Wiener schnitzel with their specialty beer cheese is a favorite for the guys! Some get extra cranberry sauce too! I would say the winner for the girls is hard to choose between the lobster bisque or the pierogis. Dancing on chairs is normal ! It's very loud and fun! The live music is awesome every time !,1
eoJfl5vG7X87QhcKb0nt5Q,"I came here to eat with some colleagues of mine while working at the RNC. I was thrilled to find a truly authentic German restaurant. We were slightly hesitant because of the 3-Star rating but I have to say - pleasantly surprised to find a place with great food, a great atmosphere, and really friendly service. We tried just about everything we could, as evidenced by the pics. I was stuffed when we left! For those in town for the RNC, the only downside was the fee to park ($10) across the street due to all the activity downtown and demand for parking for the convention. HOWEVER, I know that's likely not the case normally. This place was definitely worth the stop...and the price was very reasonable.",1
eoJfl5vG7X87QhcKb0nt5Q,"This place is the wurst. Get it? There's hundreds of kinds of German sausage and it seems as though this establishment would have them all on the menu if there was room for them in the kitchen.

We visited here for the first time the other day, and I have to say it was an impressive operation. It's a giant (50 feet by 80 feet by my estimation), clean facility with enthusiastic staff and great music. In my opinion, the food and beer are great, but this place isn't about Michelin stars and fine quisine, it's about fun, and it certainly is that!

Lots of people will have bad stories about this place, but I'd bet you that those who are disappointed fall into two categories: 1) those who are expecting this to be like a standard restaurant experience (which it is not) and 2) those have been to Germany and experienced ""the real thing"" and are forever spoiled by having survived an authentic bacchanal Bavarian bash.  

The first group will constantly attempt to flag down a server about their food temperatures, getting more ice water, bread rolls, and refills on soft drinks. They'll roll their eyes constantly about the fact that they didn't get a table all to themselves, and they'll probably say it's too loud, and that there aren't enough wines on the menu.

The second group is going to continually say, ""When I was in Munich they did this twice as good,"" and, ""the sauerkraut in Berlin was flavored with Juniper, so this isn't very authentic."" They might wax poetic about how the inn they stayed at in Oberammergau had warmest, softest dampfnudel in the entire world.

Most of these two groups won't return, which leaves more pretzels, schnitzel, spatzle, Bratwurst, dunkel, and polka for the rest of us. If you go into it expecting to stand around for a while, rub elbows with complete strangers, yell to hear your table mates, drink LOTS of beer, and load up on carbohydrates, you'll love it. And honestly, in the context of a big never-ending German festival, these activities are all a blast, especially because it's *Cleveland*.

If you're in the area, you have to try it at least once, and if you don't want to stand in a long line to eat, plan accordingly. There are ominously large tents arranged out front for those who didn't, which obviously fill with snaking lines of germanophiles who simultaneously decided to show up for breaded pork cutlets and potato salad. Alternatively, if you come for lunch on a week day you can probably park across the street and walk right in, chug a liter of light lager and inhale a pretzel, and out in 30 minutes, with a designated drive of course.",1
eoJfl5vG7X87QhcKb0nt5Q,Not like the old location; very noisy and really slow service. The food however is authentic and delicious. I'm 50/50 on returning. That polka band was good; yet annoy,0
eoJfl5vG7X87QhcKb0nt5Q,Always a party here! From guests dancing on tables to families enjoying a casual shot-ski in every corner. Beer is GREAT and food is some of the most authentic German around. A tad pricey so your best bet is to come during happy hour if possible (3-6) where beers and apps are half price. Prost!,1
eoJfl5vG7X87QhcKb0nt5Q,"Yaya beer is it. I had the Schnitzle and it's huge but not quite authentic enuf for me. I did eat it tho. Pretzel was good with mustard and beer cheese sauce too. I got a Schnitzle salad for my Bf and he loved it ! Growing up there the ambiance is authentic. If the Schnitzle was pounded quite a bit thinner and cooked in clarified butter... then u would be up my alley. But it was good enuf cause I was hungry. 
   Passing thru town. We were loading in a show at The State Theatre next door.
   I DID buy two small mugs for our BAR at home tho. That's what they served ice tea in today. Nice!",1

The atmosphere is fun and boisterous and feels authentic.  I'm German American and enjoy Oktoberfest at the local club with my family and visiting Hofbrauhaus feels like Oktoberfest every day!  The beer is great!  The band and singing and dancing on tables makes it fun for a group.  I'm glad we got there early, because it was packed.  I liked the festival seating and our service was fantastic!  I didn't order food, but snacked on some tasty pretzels.  Others at our table enjoyed their meals.  I will update my review when I get the chance to eat there.

I had the enormous pretzel, my husband had the Reuben and my daughter enjoyed the Kasespatzle. Everything was delicious! Our Server Chris was very friendly and prompt with food and drinks. The beer was authentic, cold and transported me to Bavaria.  I absolutely loved this experience and would recommend it to anyone!!",1
eoJfl5vG7X87QhcKb0nt5Q,"I am very surprised by the snotty reviews on here. Especially the girl whining about how they were being encouraged to finish their beers at 130 in the morning .... By the way you acted in a review, I'm sure you're a real delight when you're drunk at 130 in the morning. I think you left out the part where you were actually kicked out. Are you really that upset that you couldn't keep boozing for another 30 minutes? Good Lord.

Well my family and I had a wondeful experience. My mother, who is from Germany, loved the decor and said that it reminded her of back home. All of the wait staff was very friendly, including ours. 

Everyones meals were fantastic. We tried the warm pretzels first and they were delish. I cant remember the name of what I got but it was sliced bavarian ham with beer cheese on a pretzel bun. It was faaaantastic. My mother loved her potato pancakes. My kids who are notoriously picky eaters, devoured their mac and cheese that was made with swiss. My father, brother and I sampled a few German beers and they were full of flavor and very tasty.

The main dining hall was a bit loud because a fantastic German band was playing on stage. But that is the entire point of the hall. If you want a quieter experience, they have other rooms, away from the band and the crowd. 

As we were leaving, I inquired about if they had a private dining facility because I need a location for our rehersal dinner this fall. I thought that the food and atmosphere would be a fun venue for such an occasion. One of the hostesses took my family and I upstairs and gave us a full tour of the private dining facilities and answered questions that I had, all without an appointment. She went above and beyond and I really appreciated her taking the time to help me. PS. This place has some great rooms upstairs for private events!

Finally, remember this is a restaurant in downtown Cleveland.  It's going to cost you a little more than a meal at Applebee's in the 'burbs. Also, since it's not ACTUALLY in Germany, it's not perfectly authentic - if you want that, go to GERMANY. With that being said, I loved the setup and decor. My mother, again who is from Germany, loved it. Remember to ask for the dining room if you're a small party that is looking for a more quiet experience. This place would be a perfect idea for St. Patrick's Day, or after a Browns or Indians game.

Yet another great thing about C-town, The Hofbrauhaus! We will definitely be back :)",1

Our server Dillon was extremely knowledgeable with helpful answers to our questions about the menu and beer options. The flight of beers was a great choice to get started with 5 samples that were larger than I've had elsewhere. My sister and I split an schnitzel entree - more than plenty and very good. We also had potato pancakes for an appetizer, which were the least authentic item we tried.. more like hash browns than pancakes. Next time I'm in Cleveland I will definitely check me here!",1
eoJfl5vG7X87QhcKb0nt5Q,"Dinner at 6:15 for 4 on Black Friday.  We had reservations, and glad we did as the place was packed, we only had to wait 10 minutes so that was great.

Main dining room with the band was packed so they put us on the back room which was fine.  Our server was quick to greet us and bring us a few beers.  She answered our questions and took out order, so far all is good.  Then the wait started, did I mention the wait? At least 40 minutes and our server stopped by an said she would check on our order. Another 20 minutes and we had our order.

I had the Brotzeitteller, which is a cold appetizer. Pic is attached, sorry I started to eat the pretzel before I remembered to take the pic. One guest had a bratwurst sandwich with German potato salad, the sausage was cold and was sent back for a visit to the microwave. The potato salad was cold, as in right out of the cooler.  German potato salad should be served at least room temperature if not slightly warm. At least that's how they served it in May when I was in Berlin.

My other friend had the pork schnitzel which he liked enough but said it needed to be pounded thin, it was as thick as a pork chop which is just wrong. Other friend had the curry wurst which he loved and cleaned his plate.

I'm giving only 2 Stars, and I won't return. An hour wait for food is unacceptable. I understand they were busy, so hire more back of the house staff, or don't seat people if you can't take care of them.  The food was ok for 2 in our group, but not for the other 2.

Certainly try the Hofbrau Haus out, but don't expect authentic German food, and if you're here on a weekend expect to wait for your food.",0

We sat outside and were told a server would be over, waited 15 minutes and nothing. Went back inside to have the host seat us again but inside. Again 15 minutes before someone came over- it wasn't even our server but a runner of sorts but he did get our drinks at least. I ordered the wurstplatte and it was okay. The sausage was different than any other German sausage I've had, possibly frozen product. Needless to say I will not be returning. The friend I was with did say the bad service was unusual.",0

EP1do6l8hLyIGEru0gN3EQ,"This place had some good drinks.  Staff was friendly and attentive.  We only got chips and salsa with our drinks.  Hopefully, it is not an accurate reflection on the food.  What people ordered around us seemed to look pretty good but didn't look like authentic Mexican food for sure.  

Mojito Madness very nice.

EP1do6l8hLyIGEru0gN3EQ,"Why can't we give half stars?!?! If we could, this place would fall at a 2.5. I didn't feel that it warrants at 2, but is just below a three... Luckily the rounding up factor worked in their favor.

I went to JM's on Saturday night for a friend's birthday dinner. The building and ambiance are a great for drinks with friends. The food leaves some to be desired. It blew my mind how one side of the menu was ""Mexican"" and the other was of a variety of Asian cuisine with zero fushion of the two. This restaurant literally sits on top of the Iron Curtain between east and west popular dishes.

 As with most restaurants in this part of the country, I'd stick with the Asian side of the menu. The ""Mexican"" side lacks flavor and authenticity (I suppose the Asian side might as well, but I am far more experienced with quality and authentic Mexican cuisine). I had the pad thai and I would recommend it for anyone dining at JMs. Don't bother with the fried tofu. It sounds good, but is just big hunks of tufu fried. It would be much enjoyable if the tofu was cut into smaller portions before being fried.

Overall, come here for some drinks with friends and have a bite to eat if you are or get hungry. Don't bring a huge group as the restaurant just really isn't set-up for it.",0
EP1do6l8hLyIGEru0gN3EQ,"It's been a year since I visited Johnny Mango, but judging from the reviews they haven't gone downhill.  This was before I got into Yelp, so I actually ended up here on the advice of a bar bouncer.  That sounds like bit of an inauspicious start, but Johnny didn't disappoint.  I had the Pad Thai which wasn't super authentic, but very very tasty.  Wifey had a burrito which was excellent. Also loved their salsa and margaritas.  Love the quirky atmosphere (we live in a college down, so it actually reminded us of home).",1
EP1do6l8hLyIGEru0gN3EQ,"I was a bit lost getting here, but then again I'm new to Ohio City so it makes sense. I circled around and kept missing it, but finally figured it out. It's right on the corner of the weird intersection of Bridge and W. 29th. There is street parking available and a little cute awning over top. The place itself is adorable and almost NY'ish in a way. 

I met up with a friend and we had some lengthy catching up to do. Our waitress caught the vibe that we were doing a lot of talking and was present when needed but not overly checking up or making us feel rushed. Anything I asked for was delivered in such a timely manner. Very impressed! 

I started with a nice Sangria for $5 which was a great deal and was punched with flavor. It was perfectly balanced with the strength of the wine and the fresh robust juice. It went perfectly with the guac and chips we ordered, which was chunky and delicious, and not too spicy. Great texture and was delivered with a pepper on top, which I think soaked into the guac a little for a bit of extra flavor.

I ordered the chicken burrito which was two mini burritos on one plate... grilled chicken breast with earthy leafy toppings and a fresh pico de gallo. It was simple and not too heavy. It felt light and satisfying rather than weighed down and stuffed. It came with chips as well and I took one of the mini burritos to go! Very content! 

My friend ordered a chicken dish with veggies and rice that looked splendid. A lot more food with that one, so if you're really hungry or want some take out, go for one of their entrees! 

I did not try a smoothie but the deliciousness of the authentic juices I had in my sangria gave proof to what I could expect in that realm. I live less than 1 mile from Johnny Mango and super look forward to checking out some other menu options. Thanks for bringing a fresh and healthy cute little establishment with feel good vibes right down the road!",1
EP1do6l8hLyIGEru0gN3EQ,"Five stars because I've been here at least 25 times since moving to Ohio City, prolly more like 50 now that I think of it and I've never had a bad experience. 

Even though it's cramped inside it seems like a table always pops open at the last minute for you. 

Once you get settled it feels like a vacation spot and the staff is always in a great mood. 

The food is authentic and fresh, everything is good, clean and prepared right. The portions are very, very generous. 

I recommend the tuna and tofu surf and turf for a light and refreshing dish that is both healthy and delicious as well as vegetarian. 

It's Taco Tuesday every Tuesday and the $1 tacos are worth showing up weekly. Drink selection is amazing and the vibe is so great you're guaranteed to have that one extra drink when enjoying your night at Johnny Mango's.",1
EP1do6l8hLyIGEru0gN3EQ,"I'm usually extremely skeptical about restaurants (especially casual ones) that mix different ethnic foods, but Johnny Mango's does a great job.  They don't claim to be or try to do ethnic foods authentically.  Instead, they use key flavors of certain cuisines and put their own twist on it.  I can't get enough of the fried rice and the pad thai.  yum!!  This place is perfect for hanging out with friends on a summer night with a pitcher (or two or three) of margarita's.  And even though the outdoor seating is nothing more than a gated area on the sidewalk, it is a fun place to relax and people watch.
A caveat - the service, while really friendly, is pretty slow.  This is not the place to go for a quick bite.",1
epAifIGqwj5oFp5MV8kgiQ,"We sat at the bar Saturday at 4:30 A's this fine restaurant will need reservations .  Bar staff are attentive and friendly as well as authentic Italian.  I'm first generation Italian and we ate pasta every night without exaggeration growing up.  So I can say this is the real deal .

The bread is Authentic Italian with crust and soft Center.  Katie ordered salad with special Beretta (Spell?) mozzarella cheese having soft Center.  Plus her mussels appetizer was superior - it excelled in flavor - spice garlic tomatoes like bouillabaisse   To die for.

Mary ordered eggplant appetizer and she enjoyed it all including red sauce.

My pasta with pesto was not typical pesto as the chef adds a cream which makes it heavier.  The sausage was spicy and that I enjoyed to overrule the bartenders warning.

We'll be back.

epAifIGqwj5oFp5MV8kgiQ,Love this place. We come here at least once a month. The food is authentic Italian food.  We have tried just about everything on the menu and have never been disappointed. The wait staff is so friendly and attentive. As soon as you walk in they act as if your the only person in the establishment. If you want real Italian food with a relaxing experience this is the place to go!,1
epAifIGqwj5oFp5MV8kgiQ,"The Italian food here was very good and authentic. For example, the sauce I had on my spaghetti was exceptional and had actual chunks of tomato in it (unlike that canned stuff other restaurants serve). But despite the authentic food, the service wasn't all that great.

Service was kinda slow considering that the restaurant was somewhat empty. In addition to that, there was a mix-up in the servers and the staff were unsure as to who was suppose to be helping us.",0
epAifIGqwj5oFp5MV8kgiQ,"Absolutely phenomenal food.  Tried Mia Bella out for the 1st time this Valentine's Day.  By far the best Italian food we've ever had.  And that is saying something, since my husband and his whole mom's side of the family are Italian.  It becomes instantly apparent from the first bite that all of their ingredients are fresh.  The food is very flavorful without being heavy.  We had the calamari for an appetizer and we both had a pasta dish for our entree.  We definitely want to come back to try some of the other dishes.  The interior is very pretty, clean, and cozy.  The service was excellent and attentive.  The only thing somewhat critical I will say (but won't take any stars away from b/c I know it's super nit picky) is that based on how the door is situated, with just 1 door leading to the outside beside the dining room (and without a foyer area or 2nd outside doorway), whenever someone opens the door during the winter time the cold air whips right through the dining room where you're eating.  We were originally placed next to the door, and my husband had to ask them if we could move.  That was the first time we've ever had to do that.  Again, it's nit-picky, but just something to be aware of in the winter.  Just try to avoid sitting right by the entrance.  But otherwise, incredible, authentic Italian foot at a relatively reasonable price.",1

Our waitress, however, was in quite a rush and would look everywhere but you when talking. Even though she was unpleasant, our food was amazing. We ordered the linguine bianco and cheese tortellini; both of us were at a loss for words. The two pasta dishes were delicious and very authentic. One of my favorite new restaurants in the area, despite the server.",1
epAifIGqwj5oFp5MV8kgiQ,"Everybody seems to love Mia Bella, so I know I'm the outlier here and maybe they just had a bad day, but overall my experience was underwhelming.

Had the shrimp saganaki for starters and the plate was cold, lacked consistency and was a little bit too salty.

Then I had a pizza and it was equally underwhelming, the dough almost looked of the frozen kind and the whole thing was missing something.

They were pretty crowded, so that might have done it, but overall I don't get the rave reviews, especially about the Italian authenticity. If you've been to Italy you know that's not the case.

But I may give it another chance because everybody can have a less stellar day.",0

I ordered oysters and shrimp appetizers and both were absolutely amazing. I then had an arugula salad and my wife had a margarita pizza. We both looked at each other and were extremely satisfied with the meals. This place can easily compete with restaurants in New York, LA and Chicago. Will defiantly go there again.",1
epAifIGqwj5oFp5MV8kgiQ,"I've heard so many good things about Mia Bella, I had to try to myself and it was a fantastic decision! I ordered their famous spicy tortellini as my main meal. The dish was just the perfect amount of spice and I can see why they are well known for it! It's nothing like I ever had before. For dessert, I got the pistachio gelato and that was a great choice as well! There's nothing more refreshing than gelato on a nice Cleveland day! It reminded me so much of the countless pistachio gelato I had when I traveled abroad in Italy. I would say Mia Bella's gelato is pretty authentic! Good atmosphere, great food, and how can I forget about the service? Our server was very accommodating and knew when to check on us. Great dinner spot! 

Tip: If it's nice out, request to sit outside to enjoy your meal and the hustle and bustle of Little Italy!",1

The bread and herb butter that is served at the beginning of your meal is amazing and my fiance and I always order seconds. I've also had the Mia Bella pasta, which is their house specialty - it's pretty good, but a little spicy. Other notable dishes: Lobster ravioli, grilled sea scallops and buffalo mozzarella (app).",1

We came here this past Sunday and had the best lunch/dinner experience we both have ever had (we travel/eat out a ton). Lilijana (Lily) was extremely attentive, helpful and was full of personality. Her knowledge of the menu items is really what sealed the deal for us. She started off by introducing their drink special (Blood and Sand) we went with her recommendation and ordered it, 20/10 rating! Then for an appetizer, she recommended the Shrimp Saganaki, we ordered it and was absolutely blown away by how delicious it was. Lastly, she recommended the award-winning Cheese Tortellini and the Mia Bella Especiale. Let me tell you, they were both so authentic, comforting and so filling that we both had more than enough for lunch next day. We didn't even have to look at the menu because of how tasty Lily made every menu item sound. She is a huge asset to your restaurant and deserves big kudos, the server of the month and a raise.

epAifIGqwj5oFp5MV8kgiQ,"A total disappointment. Definitely NOT what you would expect from a restaurant in Little Italy. Wanted to try a new place instead of going to our favorite place (Angelo's Nido Italia), BIG MISTAKE. The service was poor and the meal was awful. Had a 5:30 reservation on a Friday evening, we were seated and waited 20 mins for a waitress to approach our table. The place was nearly empty, only two other tables with customers, so no excuse. We waited another 20 mins for our drinks (2 Peroni Beers $12) and appetizer. The appetizer (Shrimp Saganaki $13.95) was the ONLY good part of the meal (very tasty). We had to ask the waitress for bread (doubt we would have gotten it if we didn't ask), and didn't get it until we were done with our appetizer. Never asked if we wanted more bread with our dinner. We ordered two entrÁE©es Linguini Bolognese ($15.49) & Veal Braciole ($28.49). The LINGUINI Bolognese was ser""d with very thin cheap grocery store boxed spaghetti and a sauce that tasted like something from a jar. When asked about why the dish was served with spaghetti we were told it wasn't spaghetti it was a ""thinner linguini noodle"". Seriously??? Both the waitress and server insisted until we became angry that they were lying to us. At which point the waitress confessed that they didn't have any linguini and made the substitution. Would have liked to have been told this when placing the order. The Veal Braciole was tough and dry, lacking in flavor (the chefs special stuffing was not all that). The sauce was typical ""jar"" tasting sauce, definitely NOT homemade. The side of gluten free pasta was a horrible cheap boxed grocery store brand, which they charged an additional $2 for (I guess it took a lot of effort to open the box). There was no mention on the menu or by the waitress about the up charge. The total dining experience was awful. It cost $87.68 (with $10 tip, not sure why my husband was so kind). Will NEVER go back to Mia Bella and would not recommend it to others. A",0
epAifIGqwj5oFp5MV8kgiQ,"We visited Mia Bella right at opening and grabbed 2 spots at the bar. Abigal greeted us right away and was super friendly. 
They have a great drink menu. There were multiple wines on the list I love but I was not partaking tonight. They have a cool diverse choice of liquors and whiskeys. Cory choose a beer which is served in a super cool glass and an angels envy. 
There were so many options, we were overwhelmed and just ordered half a dozen oysters while we decided. They had like 9 different oysters to choose from which was a super hard choice. You can mix and match or have the chef decide. I had already told Cory he could decide when Abigal suggested we let the chef pick, but Cory had already decided Mayflower Oysters. They are an east coast oyster with that briny west coast flavor. I was impressed. They serve them with 4 sauce choices. All were delicious but I dont like to dip my oysters. 
We threw in their award winning spicy shrimp appetizer. It was so addicting. I loved the cheese in it more than shrimp. Get bread to dip in the extra sauce because that sauce should not ever go to waste!!!
We choose the specials for entrees. Mine was a tuna steak cooked perfectly, best cooked tuna ive ever had. It was served woth these citrus-y green beans and a delicious risotto. My boyfriend ordered the pork belly he said was so delicious and addicting. We were so full but we kept eating because it was so good. 
Although im a sucker for an authentic cannoli, we skipped dessert and ordered espressos because we were so full that we were getting tired and we were heading to a Yelp event down the street.

The stand owners julienne the vegetables and tofu into thin strips by hand. It's a delicious light refreshing meal by itself or as a side dish.  Another delicious offering are their spring rolls. They sell these in packs of six or by the piece.  One of the standouts are the stuffed fried chicken wings.  These are prepared with lemongrass and other spices and served with a sweet chili dipping sauce. They're absolutely amazing. They also do catering by request.

eTIP2cnpxREPDQESTjQFMg,"first off NEW LOCATION, open less than a month.
3216 W. 41 St (41st & Newark) Not correct address on YELP. 

I was a fan of the old location's food... but it only had 3 table and was very tight inside. This new place is a must if you like Puerto Rican food. It only got better! 

If you are a first timer... get the Cubano sandwich ($8.00) and a pastry to try things out. The Cubano is roasted/pulled pork, ham, pickles, cheese and dressing that is pressed cooked on Cuban bread that they also make. (Don't ever eat a Cubano that isn't on Cuban bread!) For a sweet treat, my personal favorite is a sweet cheese filled pastry, Quesitos. 

I didn't have time for the coffee, but they have the right stuff to make a great cup.

The first time walking in can be confusing for a non-Spanish speaker like me, but they are very sweet and try to help you. Several people there are bilingual. You order at the counter directly in front of you, either a platter from the prepared foods (rice & beans, roast pork, roast chicken, etc) or a sandwich, or pick an chicken or beef empanadas, or stuffed potato ball (Papas Rellenas)... are just a few of their choices. 

The pride of ownership is very tangible. This place is well lit, nicely laid out, open with good seating and super clean ... you can even see into the kitchen. 

Good value and authentic food... worth seeking out.",1
EtLmuDIMsBCmqdgpysz60Q,"I've given the restaurant two tries, and it's not impressed me.  In its defense, it does do a lot of simple yet interesting flavors.  If you go, get the calamari;  they keep the breading light and serve it with a rich, chunky marinara.  It's some of the best I've ever had.  

The service is so-so, but I've come to expect that from the over-capacity East 4th restaurants.  Order tall drinks and drink them slowly because it takes a long time to get something at the bar.

The movie ""La Strada"" being played on the wall is a nice touch.  It's unique, makes the restaurant feel more ""authentic,"" and does give diners something to do besides stare at each other.  However, a movie where the main plot points are human trafficking, violent revenge, and psychological breakdown might not be for everyone.",1

F0TQeC2VGQDZbYjtrL3QTQ,"I LOVE Bloom Bakery. Never disappoints! Think Panera, but fresher and local. I would recommend one of their sandwiches with onion chutney- it's delicious! My favorites are ham and brie, roast beef, and turkey sandwiches! Their soups are good too. Tomato and French onion are my two favorites. I've never had the salad, but they look delicious, too. All of the bakery items are labeled with who made that batch, which adds a nice touch of authenticity. My favorite bakery item is the pain au chocolat- the chocolate filled croissant. The croissant dough is perfect, and there's just the right amount of chocolate. The only complaint I could possibly have is that their hours are narrow, but it's not unusual for restaurants on CSU's campus to only be open for breakfast and lunch and closed on weekends. It makes sense with CSU being a commuter school. But still, some Saturday mornings I wake up craving a fresh Bloom breakfast, and I have to wait until Monday morning to get one.",1
F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw,"Run, don't walk to go here.  The food and drinks are amazing. Truly authentic Mexican food that is affordable and tasty. Everything is freshly prepared and it shows. Even the guacamole interpretations have a distinctly authentic feel. 
The drinks are all made with the highest quality mixers; no roses lime juice here.",1
F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw,"I have had this place on my ""bucket list"" for quite some time. Life is busy- driving into Cleveland for their 4 p.m. opening just wasn't happening easily (I live over an hour away) until TODAY! 

We had the sampler guacamole which is waaaay too much for 2 people so we packed it home...but had to try the smoked trout, the pepper, agave and Asiago and the traditional.  You might not find this useful- we loved them all.  I had Chili Relleno and my spouse had mushroom tamale with chocolate mole.  Delicious.  

Do not go here expecting what you know about Mexican food in the USA.  Don't go expecting ""authentic"" either.  Go here to enjoy a creative version of some quintessential Mexican flavors presented in an original way.  It is difficult to find good mole sauce- as it is difficult to find good food.  This mole is delicious, with depth.  If you cook, or appreciate cooking, you will like Momocho.  

I love the decor- the inside is a bit dark but the outdoor patio more cheerful.  We stayed inside because we wanted to soak up the atmosphere and watch the staff- who are, by the way, good at their jobs.  

So you may not adore the place like I did because you have not been yearning to go for over two years, or because you are not going to stop there for an early supper after a glorious and rare sunny day of Lake Erie beach hopping.  But you should go- see for yourself.",1
F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw,Loved it. Not authentic (thank god). Fun atmosphere and great execution on the food. Salsas guacs variety inventive. All the food was outstanding.,1
F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw,"To be fair in this review, I feel its important to point out that I lived in the Southwest (AZ, TX, and NM) for 12 years and had lots of authentic mexican food of all different varieties. Since Cleveland isn't exactly a mexican hot-bed, maybe I should have set my expectations lower but after I saw it on Diner's Drive-ins and Dives, I figured it had to be nothing less than amazing and decided to check it out for myself.

First of all, Momocho is kind of in a rougher area. Although there is some gorgeous architecture around, the area is littered with homeless people and after walking around a bit my wife and I felt somewhat unsafe. Momocho, however, is quite a nice place inside. It is kind of surprising that it is located there. The feeling of the restaurant is somewhat swanky and upscale. We chose to sit outside (which is thankfully fenced in) and that area was also fairly nice.

We found the staff to be somewhat cold, although not exactly rude. They definitely weren't very helpful, which would have been nice since the menu is extremely confusing. 

The menu options are basically guacamole and taco. The only real choices are what goes on/in them. You can choose between a bunch of different types of guac and the tacos give you the choice of what kind of meat/dressings go in them. We chose the pineapple guac and I got the boar tacos (my wife got pork). 

Although people generally rave about their guac, I found it fairly flavorless and somewhat disappointing. I could barely taste the pineapple. Also, our tacos were VERY salty and vinegary. 

I'm guessing my taste was biased due to my experience with Mexican food but nonetheless, it was disappointing. It was also very expensive. In my opinion, it was overpriced. The food certainly wasn't terrible, but it was very mediocre, and not note-worthy.

I probably won't go back.",0
F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw,"Since Momocho's was featured on the food network, I was very excited to go there. However I had problems with both the service/attitude of the restaurant and the food.

 ***SERVICE/ATTITUDE = THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS WRONG!: 
When I arrived wasn't sure how many people were coming so I requested a table for 10 (3 of us arrived early). Their first response was, ""we cannot accommodate you."" Afterward, I asked about sitting out on the patio, which was vacant. They said it was ok but would not allow us to put 2 tables together. This was because they did not want to collapse an umbrella at one of the tables. We would just have to break up into 2 groups. Then we sat down and took a look at the menu. When the waiter came back we asked about the happy hour specials. His response was that we are not allowed to partake in the happy hour specials if we are out on the patio, which I thought was ridiculous! After calling the organizer of our little get together, I found out that our party of 10 was only going to be a party of 6. So we moved inside and all sat at the bar. After everyone arrived and we ate our meal, we decided that we wanted to move back outside. Happy hour was over and we still wanted to hang out and have a few drinks. When we got the bill they added a 20% gratuity (parties of 5 or more), which I didn't think they deserved, but moreover, they added that even though we sat at the bar. I thought that was inappropriate. Then they REFUSED to split up the check! Again ridiculous! At this point I wanted to leave, but the others still wanted to have a drink on the patio. Now there was only 5 of us. So we went to the patio and only 3 of us ordered drinks. However, when the bill came there was the 20% gratuity again! Summary: They were very unaccommodating and I felt that they did not care about the customer. 

***DRINKS = SUGARY: 
Firstly, the Margaritas were pure sugar. I did not care for them. Plus, for being so expensive I would have expected them to make each drink individually, but instead it was all premixed. I understand that they do this to save time, so I really am not going to doc them for that. I was just surprised. 

***FOOD = NOT WORTH IT!: 
5 of the 6 of us ordered food. The waiter seemed to think that the wild boar and the duck were the best items on the menu, so in addition to those 2, we also got the tuna and mahi mahi. No one thought their meal was particularly amazing. Actually, the menu made the dishes sound more flavorful than they were. The tuna was good, but if the sweet jelly-like salsa would not have been included, it would have been very forgettable. The duck was good, however duck is very fatty, so when they cooked it all the fat melted into the bottom of the dish and they did not drain it. So a good portion of it was soaking in a pool of grease. In addition, I don't know what authentic tortillas are supposed to taste like, but these had a very strong woody taste that I did not care for. Summary: Not worth the price and would not go back. 

***DECOR = I ACTUALLY LIKED IT!: 
Ok, so this place's one saving grace was the dÁE©cor. The interior has a very unique feel with a lucha libre X day of the dead theme. I really liked it. The bar was beautiful with a backlit wine ra",0
F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw,"I was visiting from out of town and my friends wanted to come to this place. They had been before and were raving about how wonderful it was.

So the restaurant itself is cool. I like that it is an old house and that the neighborhood is pretty residential. It is unique. The inside is eclectic with lots of random artwork. All the random things on the wall like the half naked people made for conversation starters and things to joke about at dinner.

I was impressed when I called ahead to make a reservation. The host/hostesses were very friendly and were able to fit our party in when there was limited space.

The reason for the 3 stars is the food. That is pretty much why I come to a restaurant so that is the reason for a 3 star rating. To me, the food was overrated. The food was good, but not great.  Nothing stood out to me. For the price point, I expected to be wowed. I feel like I cook similar food at home. I agree with other reviewers that this is not Mexican food. However, I knew this going in. I had watched a you tube video about the restaurant and the food is the owner's interpretation of Mexican food. To me authentic Mexican food is when the menu is written on the wall and you have to point because no one speaks English. This was more of a fresh twist on Mexican.

If I were to ever return, it would be for the happy hour which you can only do downstairs in the bar.",0
F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw,"amazing guac! amazing queso dips. not a
bad place for happy hour. also visited for the pop up ramen night. wasnt a fan of the ramen. more chinese taste than japanese taste. not that authentic ramen i was looking for",1
F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw,"Mochomo Mod Mex is a hip, fun restaurant, reasonably priced and offering truly great, authentic Mexican food. We went on the recommendation of all the on line reviews, and were happy we tried it. Most of the entree part of the menu is taken up by a listing of ""Taquitos"", which are cazuelas of various types of meats served with corn tortillas to make your own tacos. I tried the chancho, which was shredded wild boar with a mustard cream sauce, and my husband had the pato, which is duck with a pomegranate sauce.  All of the taquitos come with different sauces to spoon on top of them, and both of ours came with a delicious house made pickled jalapeno relish. These are substantial meals, but you can order a side of beans and/or rice for a nominal fee. There are more entrees on the menu, and we'll go back to try them all. They offer a nice list of appetizers, and they make 5 or 6 different types of guacamole..we had the traditional, and it was good, although I've had guac all over Mexico, and the American versions always use more garlic than they would south of the border. The tequila list is more than adequate, although not hugely impressive. A wonderful bonus...eat in the bar betweeen 5 and 6:30 Tuesday thru Friday for happy hour and the ""taquito"" items on the menu are half price, as is the traditional margarita. We got out of there for $30 with tax and tip, although we didn't order any drinks. Two thumbs up for Mochomo!",1
F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw,"The margaritas, guacamole, tamales and taquitos are the BEST I've ever had. 

To the people complaining about the authenticity of this cuisine must be blind & deaf, as Momocho has made its ""mod mex"" approach very clear. 

Eric Williams, we are not worthy (bows down).",0
F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw,"I learned about this restaurant from Michael Ruhlman's website and since I was in the area on business I thought I would seek it out. The food was excellent and probably one of the few if not the only authentic Mexican restaurants in the area. My friends and I were seated promptly, the food took awhile to come out but good food is not made quickly and our meal was excellent all around. I'd highly recommend this place to anyone in the area who is looking for authentic Mexican cuisine.",1
F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw,"Momocho is one of those restaurants that does everything right. Atmosphere, simple menu, good drinks and great service.  
The food is delicious and portion sizes are generous. 
Great bold and spicy flavors. Fairly authentic ingredients but who cares when it just tastes good! 
My favorites are the tamale dumplings with mole, chile relleno and any of the ""taquitos"". 
Save room for dessert. 
Flan, fried ice cream...mmmm",1
F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw,"Momocho... Momocho, that ""Mod-Mex"" place in Ohio City. What the hell are we reviewing here? Placed loftily in the top five of Cleveland's restaurant recommendations, you would imagine that Momocho is an haute contender. But for every ten glowing reviews you page through on Yelp, you'll find one or two sobering souls that will put Momocho in it's place. These are the ones you want to read.

But all isn't lost for the Mod-Mex Momocho. I do have to say that reservations were very easy to make and grab, just be sure to do it early for special occasions or holidays. On a Friday or Saturday, you might scramble for parking as Momocho sits on a lonely quiet street without much commercial company. But whatever, you make it inside and you are overcome with trendy vibes and tones. The lighting is dim to dark and there is a heavy emphasis on warm colors. Which helps, especially when you're downing margaritas and making faces with your significant other (or significant other-to-be).

We were seated on the second level which seemed to be more like a dining area in comparison to downstairs bar-type atmosphere. Still dark up there, but I suppose that's what you can expect from Mod-Mex. Whatever that is. The wait staff was on point and definitely the highlight of my experience. Never hesitant to fulfill a request or clear out plates, that's service.

The food/drink breakdown went like this: Two margaritas (Cucumber, Blood Orange), Goat Cheese Guacamole, and the Remolacha. The cucumber margarita is excellent and definitely carries the distinct flavor on levels, include the chili flakes on the rim and you've got a great drink. The blood orange margarita was a typical fruity drink, fruity to the point where you might imagine they just added some fruit juice concentrate flavor to add exotic to the menu (this goes for the rest of the flavors). The goat cheese guac was great as well. The serving looks like roughly two cups of the guacamole and you get a nice basket of chips. This is really filling and you will definitely have to be careful to not overdo it before your entree. More on this.

The failing point was the remolacha. Beets and spinach far from roasted and lacking flavor all over. This was a worry of mine as I read the previous reviews, and unfortunately, they are right. The portion was small, and while it was in tapas form, it still left much to be desired. I can actually imagine how that dish was supposed to taste, and I wish I could go back and do it right myself. But restaurant reputations hardly get second chances in my book.

You'll find that the price point is bogus. Roughly $8+ for a slim, maybe 16oz margarita is a rip. The guacamole is a great selling point for Momocho and is definitely their flagship product. You can visit their website and see the menu's offerings but you will most likely stare at it for a few minutes and think, ""What are these things? Is this food?"" I'm sure the menu is derived from some authentic backgrounds and the names pay some homage, but no one really cares. The food has to be good.

So here is my advice. Get some good margaritas, cucumber, if that works for you. Get the guacamole sampler, it seems like the only thing on the menu that doesn't seem like a wash and you know it's going to hit the right spot. Finally, tell your friends that Momocho is not a magical place of contemporary Mexican cuisine, give them a realistic expectation. The plates are overpriced for exploration even if you go in with a primed palate. Then again, I guess they have to find some way to pay for all those boxes of avocados they must go through daily.",0
F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw,"I really liked the guacamole and original dishes as well as the homey authentic feel of the restaurant. The bar has outstanding drinks and you're bound to find something you like here. However, I do feel that the restaurant is very hyped up for what it really is. For this type of food, I would recommend Paladar at Eaton instead.",1
F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw,"Came here on a busy Saturday night with no reservation. Somehow, they were able to seat us in 10 minutes. There are long tables that most people shared with others. As with other Mexican-style restaurants, there are lots of sugar skulls and Lucha libres everywhere. The food was very good. The guacamole sampler is something we always end up ordering again and again. It's not authentic Mexican--it's a beautiful interpretation. I highly recommend Momocho.",1
F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw,"Awesome food, drinks, and wait staff.  I have to say, they serve some of the best margaritas I've ever had in the country.  They're unique flavors that you will not find at your local Chevys, Appplebees, TGI Fridays, Taco Bell, or even authentic mexican restaurants.  I highly recommend the hibiscus and pa'bango margaritas along with a third to complete your margarita sampler.  The appetizers are off the hook, especially the queso fundido.  I enjoyed the taco I got put also enjoyed some of the entrees I've had there.  As far as dessert goes, their flan is unbelievable; this is coming from a guy that typically detests the texture and taste of most flan. 

It is sometimes tough to get a table there, but only because it's one of the hottest and best places to eat when in Cleveland.  Definitely go there if you're a group, but for a date it's not the best because it can get really loud in there.",1
F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw,Best tacos I've had in Cleveland area yet authentic Mexican street taco taste with a modern twist. You HAVE try the cucumber margaritas,1
F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw,"Yeah, this place is ridiculous.

Went here to get some authentic Mexican food with my husband and his parents. It's a tiny and incredibly dark restaurant. We were seated and noticed the menu had at least five types of Guac, all really expensive. They also include things like tacos with duck confit and foie gras. I grew up in Southern California, and I'm sure you're never--make that NEVER EVER--supposed to have that junk in tacos.

When we asked the waitress if there was a place where we could get regular, authentic food, she made a disgusted face, mustered all the disdain she could and said, ""You mean, like, cheap Mexican food?"" 

Yes. I'd like some cheap, authentic, no-nonsense, no BS Mexican food. If you're looking for that, then don't go here.",0
F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw,"Mod Mexican, I am impressed.  They redeveloped Mexican classics into creative dishes, and ended up being more authentic then 99% of the restaurants in the area. It was great to see a place be mod, but lose none of the integrity or flavor of what the dish is representing, Ok a little dizzy from all the circles.

When the first dish spins your sombrero around, you know you are in for something special.  The guacamole sauce is rich and smooth, but with enough chunk to give it a heaviness.  So the lifting of this dip will getting well on the way to being fit for your Lucha libre dÁE©but.

my dinner was carnitas / adobo braised pork / honey-chipotle mojo.  The squares of pork fell apar",1
F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw,"A great example of authentic Mexican cooking.

Momocho is a place you go to get a genuine taste of Mexico. I had carnitas that cannot be duplicated by your local Mexican chain. If your favorite Mexican dish is the #17 with chicken, you really owe it to yourself to pop into this little joint.

The upstairs dining area is small and intimate, without being too tightly packed.
The walls boast pictures and paraphernalia of Nacho Libres, Mexican wrestlers, and has an almost man cave feel to it.  You'll also have a good eye on he guacamole bar, which is amazing to watch. The menu has over 10 different guac's all tasting as unique and delicious as the rest. 

So I highly recommend that you make a reservation and check this place out!",1
F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw,"This is one of those places that I wasn't sure that my wife would enjoy but I was so wrong. We didn't have reservations (get reservations) and aren't familiar with the area so we arrived 30 minutes before they opened. By the time they actually opened the door there were 5 couples waiting on a Thursday night. 
Once we were seated we started over the menu and couldn't decide what to go with. I had decided that I wanted the elotes and a guacamole but they had 8 options to choose from. At that point the server came over and  quickly said that the guac with goat cheese was his favorite and the most popular. Easy choice. 
  We stuck with water and they had a person whose entire job was to keep the cups filled and the dishes cleared. This was an amazing benefit since the table filled up quickly with the large portions. The guacamole was the best that I have ever had. The goat cheese adds an additional creaminess that the guac already has and it is just a perfect appetizer. The elotes was creamy and had a spice that really elevated it. I liked it but my wife devoured her part so I guess she liked it more than I did. 
  For mains my wife had the scallops, that were enormous and cooked perfectly, and I got the taquitos from happy hour. I went out on a limb because I don't like mole and these are cooked in it but you could tell that the tortillas were made well and the items were all quality. 
  When I thought that I was done I saw that they had flan and I can't pass up a new flan. This is not your typical flan as it tasted like a pumpkin pie flan. I am not sure if this is the way that it should be to be authentic but it was AMAZING. 
  After a 25% tip for amazing service our check came in at $75 and I think that is an amazing deal. We got 2 apps, 2 entrees (including their most expensive in the scallops), and a dessert plus tip for $75. You won't find that bargain anywhere else.",1
F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw,"Food: if you're a Mexican cuisine lover who can appreciate modern eats, this is the place for you. It's definitely not authentic Mexican or anything you'd traditionally see. They do an artful and delicious take on Mexican foods, which are amazing! To start, get one of their guacs, the pecorino and the goat cheese were my favorites! But like any Mexican restaurant, be careful not to fill up on the chips and guac! I've done it everytime I've come here, and then have trouble finishing my entree. For drinks, trying the margarita sampler is a must! I'm partial to classic margs, but the red pepper with the smoked ant salt and cucumber with the salted rim are amazing! For the entree, everything is delicious that I've tried. The flautas were an irresistible dish with cheese inside of a fried roll, topped with roasted brusslesprouts and shaved beets, all in a bed of sweetened mole sauce. Amazing!!!  

Atmosphere: I've only sat inside, and that's mainly because the inside is very dark. It's definitely intimate, but I prefer something a little more open. We sat on their patio, which is great and very big. It's got cute festoon lights, umbrellas and plants. The only con was all the bugs... bring some citronella oil to ward those buggers off!",1

F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw,"Momocho serves the most authentic Mexican food that I have found in Cleveland thus far! While a bit pricy, you definitely receive what you pay for. One thing I really appreciate about Momocho is the use of super fresh homemade corn tortillas! This is something almost impossible to find so far from the border, and they are delicious. Be prepared to want to order everything on the menu and treat yourself to one too many tequila drinks. It's all fantastic.",1
F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw,"Great ambience but definitely needs a reservation. I made one and still waited 30 min for a table and didn't even get the upstairs one like I requested. We ended up right in front of the door which was super cold. 
We got drinks while we waited. I got the margarita sampler (my fav was the spicy mango) followed by the grass ass. Those bartenders can really make a good cocktail. 
The guacamole sampler is really big (we were just two people and could only finish one). I liked the baked trout the best (but they are known for their goat cheese one which is also very good. The crab and corn one is ok. I think with the other two having such pungent flavors, we couldn't really taste that one at all). 
We got the lamb enchilada which were very good. Cooked well and stuffed with meat. The mole almost taste Moroccan. There's a lot of cinnamon and possibly raisin? 
We are so much Guac I'm glad we only got one entree. We still had so much to bring home. 
This establishment def is mod mex and not like a traditional Mexican restaurant. Everything. Was done very well but I think flavor wise, I prefer authentic Mexican. I couldn't really tell I was eating Mexican food (which I think was the point?). 

I can see why people love it here though! They also have a lot of interesting vegetarian options for those with dietary restrictions. I'm not sure if I'll be back for dinner but I'll def be back for happy hour!",1
F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw,"Momocho? More like Rococo Loco. My husband and I read rave reviews about this spot from Bon Appetite magazine and decided to give it a go. Firstly the environment is way better advertised on google search than in person. Feels more like a sports bar that has food. The margaritas were nothing special, and the food was horrible. We ordered the Rellenos and some sides, all of which tasted like cardboard and velveeta. Wait staff was nice but would never recommend this place. There's gotta be better Mexican food, more authentic. Also my husband pointed out that a Mexican place that only offers one hot sauce is a red flag. Indeed!",0

Seating is VERY limited and if you don't have reservations they are very suggestive you sit at the bar which is first come first serve. We started out with the margarita sampler, you can pick 3 off the menu and it comes like a ""flight"" i suggest the blood orange it was fantastic! We also did the three salsa sampler which was way too much food for 2 people, I also suggest the salsa verde, I could have drank it the flavor was phenomenal! We ordered entrees, I got the carne Asada with lime rice, it also comes with beans but I didn't want them, the food was bursting with flavor. You can tell everything here is authentic and made from scratch, we can't wait to go back and take some friends, we will definitely make reservations next time!",1

This place came in highly recommended by co-workers and after reading the reviews here, I decided to give it a try. I have been to Mexico several times and have been to several Mexican restaurants in the US. This place is trying to reinvent the wheel. For starters, the prices are extremely high for what they offer and they are trying to make things too fancy and complicated when they don't need to be.

I have ordered the tacos al pastor. The dish came in with big chunks of pork, no cilantro, no raw onion. It looked like a stew and you still had to put them on the tortillas. The tortillas were very authentic, but I had to put an order for extra ones to finish the dish. The price was very high - $14 and I have had REAL AUTHENTIC tacos for way less than that.",0

Avoid this wanna be...",0
FeigEbRVs3d_WoMVUhIT7g,"Just ok if you are in the area and the other surrounding restaurants have a long wait. Weak specialty cocktails and food is crazy overpriced for the portion sizes as are drinks. There are many authentic Thai/Asian restaurants locally that are better taste and priced accordingly. Now we see why. We were at an event on the East bank, surrounded by restaurants and Crop Sticks was the only option that did not have a long wait just to sit down. However, when we walked in and sat at the bar, the bartender took a while to acknowledge us. Even then, he was multi-tasking and made us feel like we were an inconvenience. With all due respect to the owner/Chef, to sustain repeat guests, things need to be fixed. 

Prices are crazy. Chicken or Shrimp Pad Thai is $17. I asked for a combo (no problem!) and they charged me $24! Had he told me the price I would not have ordered it. Order pad thai combo elsewhere, and they don't charge you $7 upcharge, or they would tell you before ordering so you can decide. Bartender recommended the chicken egg rolls ($9 for 2) and after seeing them, they looked like standard egg rolls priced under $2 elsewhere.

Not impressed. Perhaps this review will be helpful.",0

But if you want an excellent, fresh from the oven bagel, Bialy's is the place to go.  You'll also save a fortune on bagels.  My boyfriend and I each got a bagel and I got a cream cheese for a whopping $1.45.  Excellent deal and even better bagels.

fiYqGH-esbPpO-3DnSqVeg,"Hi. My name is Cara and I'm sick to death of people comparing every-damn-thing in Cleveland to other big cities. 

Best bagel you've had outside of NYC? Well, good for you. But Bialy's has the best bagels I've ever had. Not outside of of any other city--just best ever. 

We're talking hand-rolled, poked, boiled and baked from scratch right in shop right from an old, authentic recipe. I could seriously eat three of these things in one sitting, no schmear required. I mean just straight up. They're that good. 

Crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside... I could dive into a kiddie pool full of these bagel and live in utter bliss for the rest of my life. I could have their baby bagels, that's how much I love them. 

The interior of Bialy's isn't much to write home about, but I think it just adds to the authenticity of the bagels. So, the idea is to grab some to take home and be sure to stock up, as they'll go frickin' fast. I too, agree with yelper Jessica B in her wish to have a schedule of when these bad boys are hot-out-the-oven, because I'd be there everyday for a snack. 

I have never tried their cream cheese or the pretzel bagel, but just thinking about how good they must be is making my mouth water. It's too bad that I'd probably blow up like a land monster if I gave into all my Bialy's cravings... then again, it might be worth it.",1
fiYqGH-esbPpO-3DnSqVeg,"*sheds tear* I just wanna thank the yelpers who checked into this place X amount of times for it to show up on my timeline. I wanna thank the little man behind the counter this morning who took my bagel fresh off the line and right into the bag, I wanna thank the sidewalks for keeping me off the streets..and I wanna thank baby Jesus for the invention of bagels. With that being said I am IN LOVE with this little bagel place. Literally little, no tables strictly takeout. They have drinks but it's ALL about the bagels. Egg, everything( or mishmosh) as they call it, salt...all you can ask for in a bagel. It's been hard for me to find an authentic NY bagel in the land but I have stumbled upon it alas!!! My ONLY gripe is that they don't have cream cheese selections nor do they have lox.  It was packed I was there at 7:15 on a Saturday and the line was out the door, that's how I love to see it done!! The bagels have the perfect crispy outside with the soft bagel dough on the inside, the mishmosh flavor explodes in your mouth and my tummy is a happy soul after this visit! I will 11110000% be back!!!",1
fJ7grcsEvEKPZbje_3CFYw,"When Lelolai was on West 25th Street it was a bakery that also sold sandwiches. The draw was the large selection of tropical pastries and the flans. Sitting at a table overlooking the street with strong coffee and sweet pastry was one of those glad to be alive moments. 

The move to the Old Arcade puzzles me. Now Leolai offers very little bakery and relies on its weak sandwich offerings. The Cuban sandwich was made on bread that was so dry it was difficult to swallow. I much prefer the more authentic slices of pork over the shreds. From food trucks to diners to restaurants, cooks in Cleveland are lazy and cheap as hell by using all purpose pulled pork where other cuts should be used. 

I found no line for Leolai but long lines for Greek food and for the steak and fries. Surely a sign that Leolai's menu needs vast improvement.",0
fJ7grcsEvEKPZbje_3CFYw,"I came here for lunch and ordered a cuban sandwich. What I took back to the office was most definitely not a cuban sandwich.

How can you call some pulled pork on hard bread with no cheese and mayo a cuban? Let me say that again, MAYO!!!

The sandwich was not pressed either.

This place is not worth the time or the money for it and its about as authentic as sbarro.  Sbarro would be better.",0
FjWkdzVMhv5S-Lm1Qu1AEw,"Definitely not bad.
The price point is fair and the decor is classic 1990's Thai restaurant feel -- with earth-tone of a lighter heft.  The flavours are mild for thai -- I'd prefer a little more punch.  We asked for authentic hot, and got non-existent spicyness.

I'm going to have to do a little more exploring to determine my favourite Thai venue, but this place isn't too bad.

Service was brisk and almost brusque -- but that's okay, right?",0
FjWkdzVMhv5S-Lm1Qu1AEw,"Hrm. I've been pretty disappointed with Asian cuisine around Cleveland, but Mint Cafe is pretty good.

Started off the dinner with my thai tea. Man, was I craving a thai tea. It was okay, but did its duty to definitely wake me up after a long day. I chose the Mango Curry, per recommendation of our smiley waiter. Man, he was constantly smiling... maybe he was overly happy to see us? Nonetheless, he sure was friendly. 

The mango curry was okay. It had chicken, shrimp, squash, and other veggies. The size of it was not the biggest...and it.. wasn't spicy. :P I kind of wish it had more kick. I did enjoy the mangoes though. My friend liked the pad thai. 

Not super authentic dishes, but if you're having that semi-thai food crave, definitely stop by mint. I would stop by here again... it's your a-ok..",1
FjWkdzVMhv5S-Lm1Qu1AEw,"For those who say this is the best thai food in the Greater Cleveland area, you have to try Charm Thai (esp. their country style pad thai) in Broadview Heights.  

I expected more from Mint, our group ordeed several noodle dishes (Jade noodles, country style pad thai and vegetarian pad thai).  I can only talk about the Jade noodles, however my dish was oily and lacked flavor.  It tasted like they just took cooked noodles, stirred in some mild sauce, some cooked shrimp and tofu and plopped it on a plate.  The onions didn't even have any color to them!

The only thing preventing me from giving Mint 1 star was their golden bag appetizer which was an interesting twist on a shrimp purse, however the contents of the purse was spongy and tasted like it was cooked from frozen.  

I ordered their thai iced tea, which is usually fail proof.  Unfortunately their tea was watered down and did not utilize true half and half or condensed milk- so it got even more watered down.

Would not consider going to Mint again.  Ill stick with Charm Thai- its in the burbs' but it's the most authentic thai in the area.",0

FjWkdzVMhv5S-Lm1Qu1AEw,"Cleveland is a city unusually resplendent with authentically delicious Thai food and choosing between these restaurants is for the most part a scenario where you cannot lose. Yet amidst these viable contenders there is leader of the pack who pulling ahead and rounding the final curve to victory. in this reviewer's opinion, the winner by a nose ahead of tree country and  a full length beyond lemon grass is The Mint Cafe. 
    The Jasmine rice forms a base for almost any meal, setting it a mile beyond a more mundane fried-fare. The various selections of curry are delicious without exception, although the real show-stopper is the mango curry with shrimp. Its an ideal mixture of hot and sweet, almost tropical. The the closest I've come time a parallel experience was in El Salvador spice and mango thrive although without the milkiness of coconut found here. 
   I'm not a slave to an over-bloated belly, but i found the servings to be more than satisfying, with enough flavor that I would still be scraping my plate had I eaten ten times as much.
   Eating out is always a gamble, with too many variables to make any one place a sure thing. That being said, there is no feeling in the world like backing a winner.",1
fKJK8Wrfhq9n6qNqWZ6J0Q,"Traditionally, I would avoid such a cholesterol-raising endeavor, but the other day the craving called, and who am I to deny it? Exactly. I casually drove up to the Drive-Thru and was greeted by a surprisingly delightful amount of enthusiasm that I had thought was generally reserved for finer dining establishments such as Chipotle. 

Anyway, after efficiently taking my order and politely instructing me as to what one should do next in order to keep the transaction rolling smoothly, I was then called ""dear"". Hand to Jesus, I was now being spoken to with endearment. For a brief moment I was filled with warmth and a longing for my mother's embrace.... So I pulled forward. 

At the window, I was elated to finally meet the woman who had shown me such love so early on in the relationship. Her smile was authentic and her cheery demeanor emanated from within. She also had wicked tight hair. The joyful face-to-face conversation was above and beyond any that I had encountered in such situations of the past. Her co-worker, who was scooping up the piping-hot fries also chimed in with some pretty sweet one-liners. I had died and gone to Burger King Heaven. 

Compliments were flying, and the fries were a frying, but it was time to move on for all of us, and although hard, I pulled away with what was truly a remarkable fast-food encounter and vowed to write a review. 

All of us foodies pretend, that these little blights on our palates don't exist, but lets be real... We all still occasionally visit  the king or the arches. Let us not hide in shame, but tell of our journeys and make the road less traveled better known.

fQP_jXrSoVKty5zxV3_Z6g,"I love crepes.  More importantly, I love crepes in the middle of the night, served with eggs and hash browns and a giant carafe of coffee.

You wouldn't normally think of IHOP as a five-star kinda joint, but for what it is, this IHOP gets five stars.  It's clean, the service is good, the food is good, and I can go there anytime I want to get my yummy crepe fix.  Sure, I can get a better, more authentic crepe at Le Oui Oui Cafe in Ohio City, but it's further away and not open in the wee hours of the morning when crepes taste the best.

They also have a wide selection of omelettes, french toast, and other breakfast foods, oh, like PANCAKES, for example, in case I wasn't clear about that.  I was blinded by my crepe craving.  Though to be fair, you probably should know that already.

fS1QBwuCUXVQ_K7LNnYvBg,"I love Mexican food, I love margaritas and I'm only kinda in love with Mi Pueblo. 

The margaritas aren't the best. The mix is florescent green and usually tastes weak. The Vegetarian burrito is filled with things like steamed carrots, potatoes and broccoli. And to be honest the veggies don't taste very fresh, they all have that white, canned coloring to them. 

I have been out of the country many times and this is far from the most authentic. I personally liked Luchitas the best but I would still pick El Rodeo over Mi Pueblo. The major thing that works for Mi Pueblo is the location and the late hours. 

The food isn't the worst I've had but there IS better.",0
fS1QBwuCUXVQ_K7LNnYvBg,"Comfortable atmosphere, seems authentic as the abuelitas and tias were cooking in the back. Started off with the house tortilla chips ( stale) and salsa, followed by the chicken soup which was just ok.  Ordered the carnitas, chicken fajitas, and michelada. Carnitas were in a tomato based sauce, which was different from the usual fare ( fried and pulled) ...chicken fajitas were a little bland...michelada was good and on par to comparable restaurants. Overall would recommend if you had no other Mexican restaurant to go to and were in the area...otherwise, you probably won't be missing out if you went elsewhere",1
fS1QBwuCUXVQ_K7LNnYvBg,"3 stars for being a decent Mexican restaurant near where I work.  Their food is pretty good, and they have some authentic Mexican stuff as well.  Problem is that their service was S-L-O-W.  At lunch hour, there were maybe 30 people in the dining room (it looks like it will hold about 100).  There were at least 5 front of the house servers plus the manager/owner, Mr. Ortega.  There was an 8 top and around 6 tables of 3-4 including ours.  We sat down at around 11:50 and didn't get out until 1:10.  This was because we waited for our food, and then waited again when we went to check out.  The entire server staff seemed weeded by serving the 8 top.  Then, after those people left, another 8 top of actual Mexican men came in, and the flirting with the female servers made our wait time increase.  Once we were ready to check out, our water busied himself with inputting the orders for the new 8 top, and the manger/owner stood there while we waited.  Finally, our waiter got up and went to the kitchen without ringing up our tabs, and the manager/owner took a sip of his comp drink.  When we asked if he could help, he was super nice, but it was a bit odd that he didn't think it strange that we three gringos were just standing there doing nothing.

So, in the final analysis, Mi Pueblo has good food, but don't go if you are on a schedule.  The servers were nice, and so was the owner/manager, and I would say that my experience there was overall positive, but I did get back to work later than I wanted to.  (they did seem to know that they were slow, because they gave us free soup and an extra basket of tabletop nachos while we waited...)",0
fS1QBwuCUXVQ_K7LNnYvBg,"OK, 1st off this is not as good as the the one on Lorain. But there are some good things on the menu. Tacos, Tortas, and Tostadas are the best things to get on the menu. The mole is hit or miss but mostly hit. The burritos are good but not like chipotle. The re-fried beans very good. The chicken soup authentic. Cheap drinks. The steaks are very good here as well, just realize it is flank or skirt steak and not Hyde Park. I brought my father in-law from Mexico here and he loved it. An not to for get the chips and salsa are good.   This is a very good value for what you get. I stay way from the flautas and stuff like that, because i just don't care for them. Just keep in mind that If a Mexican place has ground beef as the main ingredient in most dishes then it is not really authentic. This place does not have any dishes with ground beef. My only criticism is that they have raw onions mixed with cilantro. I hate raw onions. If I were the owner I would have a few specials from different parts of Mexico, feature food from the Yucatan for a couple of months, etc... I have noticed that when the owner is present this place is on the A game.",1
fS1QBwuCUXVQ_K7LNnYvBg,"I worked in the restaurant biz for many years and its really laborious and hard work. This restaurant was not at all busy today but it took the host 15 minutes to seat us. The waitress seemed clueless and unfamiliar with the menu. I told her exactly what we wanted and she still screwed the order up. I told the staff we were a little pressed for time. She seemed not to care. She gave us soup which we didn't order. I had a few bites. It was bland. The tacos were authentic but we got sidestepped by waitress because we ordered ala carte and she said "" once you order this item and don't SAY ala cart, it automatically comes blah blah blah blah."" Bad customer service move. Bad. Don't EVER try to trick a customer into trying to spend more money so you can get a bigger tip. Fail. I can see right through it. Looks bad upon the management too. I am a generous tipper but shafted this girl today for her lazy brain. ASK people what they want and don't over promise and under deliver. I will not likely be back even though a nearby vendor recommended the place. Owner: get off your butt and save your restaurant!",0
fS1QBwuCUXVQ_K7LNnYvBg,"I liked that some of the menu items were unusual, including the carrots served with every meal. My time in Mexico was too brief to judge, so I'll just assume that ""unusual"" here means authentic! Good.

Note to vegetarians: many meals (even otherwise vegetarian ones) are served with chicken-based vegetable soup: no substitutions, no option. (But if you ask in advance you can just skip it.) On the bright side, I'm told that both the rice and refried beans are made without lard or meat broths. That's good.

I've been twice. Of the two things I got, one (some kind of squash?) was fine, but more interesting than it was tasty; the other (quesadillas) was surprisingly small for the price, and the rice and beans seemed very old/dried out, to the point where the rice was crunchy. Neither one had much flavor. I'll probably try them again, since vegetarian rice and beans are hard to come by, but my expectations are low!",0
fS1QBwuCUXVQ_K7LNnYvBg,"This was by far the best Mexican restaurant I tried in Cleveland (though I didn't try them all), and while it is not a model for consistency I still count it among my favorite places.

While it may not look like much from the outside, inside you will find a lively, colorful dining room (with an attached bar that leads into another portion of the restaurant). No complaints here. 

Upon being seated you are given chips and two kinds of salsa, as well as pickled carrots (sometimes you get a jalapeno in there as well, though not always, alas). I can't say they are the best chips, nor the best salsas I've ever had, but they are better than most and are always appreciated. I typically ordered either a burrito or taco platter, but I tried some of the more unique entrees as well. With every meal you also receive a small bowl of chicken soup, which in my visits was always delicious and obviously homemade. A nice touch. Portions were generous, and it is impossible to leave hungry. Drinks range from the usual domestic and import bottles/drafts, to the margaritas, which like the chips/salsa are good but not world beaters. Still, they get the job done, and are half-price on Wednesday. Many of the beers are also very cheap, all things considered. Various tequilas are also listed, though many of my favorites were perpetually unavailable. 

Now, more on the consistency factor...after the first several visits, it seemed rare to see the same people working there more than once. For regular diners this can be a bit off-putting. As such, the service would also vary, from great to casually interested. Short of one or two rare occasions, I can't really complain too much. I would suggest NOT going for a full meal late on the weekends, as this was the only time the food did not meet par...undercooked and slow to arrive (how that happens is anyone's guess). It appears that the drinks n' snacks crowd is the priority here at that time, but given its proximity to Case I suppose that is to be expected. 

All things considered, after multiple visits, this place is a winner. Not perfect, but far better than many other options in town (and in other, bigger cities as well). It passes the ""authentic"" test, as you will always see Mexican families in the dining room, often celebrating a birthday party or other occasion. Worth a trip.",1

I'm not one of those folks who thinks that ethnic food has to be very authentic and close to what you'd get in the food's nation of origin. I love Taco Bell and pretty much any Americanized Chinese restaurant that's on the map. 

...But I am one of those folks who wants food to be GOOD. Mi Pueblo's food just isn't good! I've gone there several times and ordered a wide variety of meals, ranging from the bold to the boring, and they've been disappointing every time. It kills me to give it two stars, because I would eat at this place eight days a week if it were good because I love Mexican, and it's also the place that my mom first met my now-wife and later on told me that she was delightful...but since one of the worst things in life is a bad meal, I must, so that others are not led astray.

The only reason that this place gets two stars is because: 1.) The chips and salsa, which flow throughout the meal, are quite good and 2.) They have free parking. Around University Circle, it's easier to find a four leaf clover than it is to find free parking.

If you're visiting University Circle, plan on skipping Mi Pueblo.",0
fuPhVyvwoMFNRqM4O1CkeQ,"I've been eating here for years, even before I moved to Cleveland. Now that I'm officially a downtown resident, I love that Aladdin's is just a few blocks away. First of all, they have a great little grocery offering a good selection of products. Hummus, olives, pita, olive oil, and a lot of sweets. A great stop if you want to stock up on well made, authentic food. 
They also offer a pretty large menu of pita sandwiches, salads and other Mediterranean fare. I've tried many of their salads and their savory pies- the spinach and feta is a favorite. On this particular visit I opted for the falafel pita and a couple grape leaves. The falafel was good, the actually falafels were a tad dry but the tahini dressing on the sandwich definitely made up for that. And for only 4 dollars for a large sandwich, it's a good buy. The grape leaves were very well seasoned, but I have noticed a slight deterioration in quality- mainly lack of meat in the grape leave over the years. I understand it's probably a cost saving measure. But when the grape leaves are about 95% rice with tiny tiny specs of meat, I'm a little disappointed. 
Still, this is a tried and true Cleveland staple for me. I recommend checking it out if you're downtown, especially if you're seeing an Indians game as its so close to the stadium!",1

Eat in or take out. 

If you want Pita bread... this is the place... they make it there, you can't get fresher! Day pita old is cheap and great to make your own pita chips with. All you needs for Middle Eastern cooking are available too. A large variety of olives out of vats, you get to taste them before buying... so authentic.

fuPhVyvwoMFNRqM4O1CkeQ,"What a gem!!!

We stopped in Cleveland during a long road trip for a bite to eat. We were just going to hit up your standard fast food restaurant, but then I drove past this place. I knew instantly that I must stop!!

This place is set up like a little market. They have so many different items in their store - it's amazing, trust me!  I stocked up on some goods and noticed through the glass that the workers were making fresh pita in the room over. It was like a small factory set up. Their pita was soooo reasonably priced and very, very good. They also sell day old pita for half the price! 

In additional to the store and the fresh pitas, they also serve food. You just approach the counter and order what you want. They have some pre-made things (sort of like a deli set up) and also items that they can whip up for you. There were huge blocks of fresh feta cheese and just everything you could possibly want in a Mediterranean styled place. The prices were sooo good, too. I grab some pre-made salads to take home (they were only like $5 or $6) and had fresh herbs in it. Then we ordered the chicken shawarma sandwich, which again was under $6. It had chicken served in their freshly made pita with garlic, lettuce, tomato, onions, pickled turnips, parsley and tahini sauce. They were really big and absolutely delicious.  I was so excited to be eating it! This is by far the best of this food that I have ever had. It is all so fresh, authentic and tasty. 

Buffalo has several places that serve similar food, but they are definitely lacking the market style of this place. The food surpasses any place in Buffalo by far. I genuinely wish this place was in Buffalo because I would be there weekly - whether it would be to buy groceries, pita or a nice meal.

Since it's 2015, I like to order pizza online, and this one was for pick-up. The website could use a huge makeover with it's amateur-like interface. After figuring out how to make my order, I received an email notice saying my pizza will be ready in....wait for iiiiitt, 45 minutes. 45 minutes!!!! Okay, whatever, I figured if it takes them that long then it better be baked to perfection. I go to the shop 42 min later, pick up my pizza within 5 min, and go back home. I open the box, ready to be amazed by all the ravings I've heard from others including ""authentic Italian pizza"", ""high quality"", ""amazing local pizzeria"". Pshhhhhhtt, are you kidding me?!?! Were you guys born on another planet? This was perhaps the worst cheese pizza I've had in my lifetime. The pie barely had any cheese, it was horribly cut (I had to grab a knife to fully cut it), and the base of the pizza was ~cardboard dry/burny, with about a ~5mm thickness. Because I pride myself on being unbiased, I continued to eat the pizza, but mostly because I was starving. It tasted like I just bought pizza from a backroom pizzeria that sells dollar slices, except burnt. Waste of my time, and a bad way to end the day for my stomach. Have fun ordering, you guys!

FwS2grX_4u879hzjfYFakg,"Unique. Great ingredients. Delicious

I've been here more times than I would like to admit.
Valentino's is a cute little hole in the wall, family run pizzeria that serves up a unique and strangely addicting pizza. I really like that you can see a fresh pizza being rolled out everytime you go

I grew up on 'brooklyn style' pizza, and have eaten various styles of pizza from all over the globe, including authentic pizza from Italy.

There is no such thing as a 'correct' way of making pizza, nor is there such a things as the 'best' pizza. What it comes down to is personal preference (which is true for all food), and Valentino's is a winner in my mind. Here's why!

Crust: It is a no-nonsense crust, no garlic or cheese (like they do in fast food chains), and they don't even roll up the edges! (which I really like). Never dry, their crust provides just the right amount of chewiness.

Cheese: Fresh. I know this not only from eating their pizza, but also from getting the Valentino's salad (which I also love). They put the same mozzarella that goes on pizza on their salad. Cheese is pretty straight forward, you either use fresh, quality ingredient, or you don't. Valentino's does.

Sauce: This element of Valentino's pizza is perhaps my favorite, and yet it is also the most difficult to describe. Something about their red sauce just makes their pizza different. It has a more tomato-y taste to it. Sweeter? More tart? Difficult to describe. It is like normal steak vs dry-aged steak, where the a latter has a tad more intense flavor. 

Valentino's takes all these elements, and produces a very well balanced pizza that they should be very proud of.

Tip: This may sound odd, but I like to get plain cheese slices that have already been made, cooled down, but then reheated to order in the back. Reason: when their pizza first comes out of their oven, it is hot, REALLY hot. So hot that I have burnt the top of my mouth several times attempting to eat it. But if you let it cool down, the crust won't be as good. Ask for an individual slice from the back to be reheated. Just the right temp to eat.

Additional note: Their artichoke and olives white pizza is delicious as well (a little on the heavy side though). And their tiramisu is also highly recommended! (rich, and not too sweet). They have a little patio on the side where you can eat after you order.

g5XW5RiVhykjleeRrWlJ2g,"Flying Cranes Cafe is a lovely little restaurant that I discovered during my search for ramen in Cleveland. It is run by a married couple, consisting of an (I'm guessing based on his accent) European man and his wife, who is Japanese. This explains why the dichotomy of their menu that serves both quiches and ramen.

The Food:
+Ramen: This is not the most amazing ramen I have ever had, as the broth is a simple chicken base. However, it is authentic, and gives a comforting and homey tastes. I would say this is the best ramen I have had in Cleveland. It also comes in a generous portion! The first time I came here, the bf had made a special request for more noodles, which we found were unnecessary after the food came out.
+Brunch: You pick an entree, and it comes with a soup (there were 2 options given), salad, and a cookie. Again, not the most amazing food I've ever had, but hearty and comforting.

The service can be quite slow, but I honestly don't really mind it. This is the kind of place that you come to just sit and enjoy yourself slowly. Plus, the owners are very friendly and they were very accommodating towards our requests!",1
g5XW5RiVhykjleeRrWlJ2g,"I have been to the Flying Cranes Cafe many times since its opening in 2007 and I can attest that it's an awesome place to study, relax with friends, or chill with a book. As a Japanese-American living in Cleveland, it has been particularly exciting that the Flying Crane has come to the neighborhood. The menu is extensive and authentic and everything I've tried has been excellent. The portions are quite large and each dish looks and tastes like it was cooked and prepared with care. My personal favorites are the Teriyaki dishes (particularly the Salmon and Seared Tuna), Japanese Eggplant with lemon-ginger sauce, and Chicken Udon. I've tried many of the sandwiches and always enjoy the Chicken Salad Sandwich (sooooo good) and Naomi's Ultimate Grilled Cheese Sandwich.

The brunch is a really great deal with plenty of food. I've tried the Broccoli and Goat Cheese quiche and Ham and Split Pea Soup (both homemade) for brunch and they were delicious. If you are lucky in the summer and spring, you can snag a table in the beautiful garden. This past spring, I had a wonderful meal under the lush Wisteria canopy.

A group of friends and I recently tried the English High Tea, where we sampled a few different black teas as well as some biscuits and other treats. It was elegant and a really nice experience, and something I haven't seen offered at other places in Cleveland.

All in all, the Flying Cranes is a great cafe that has a lot to offer and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a place with delicious food, relaxing atmosphere, and good value.",1
g5XW5RiVhykjleeRrWlJ2g,"3.5 stars, rounding up because I am putting my foot down as the yelper in the relationship.

Here's the thing.  This place has gone and done it, and has totally torn us apart.  

I ordered the ramen and I was absolutely flabbergasted.  It was very good!  Full-flavored and cooked with authentic ingredients, not too salty, not too sweet.  And the broth had a terrific aftertaste as I expect from good ramen.  I never expected anything like this to exist in Cleveland and I was ready to give this place a five, hands down, for filling the ramen void in my life.

She ordered the kakiage-don, a traditional japanese rice bowl with tempura vegetables.  She hated it.  Thought it wasn't authentic (I do admit, it wasn't really), did not have any real substance to it, and did not taste particularly special.  She did not finish it - though I did, and thought it was still a well-flavored rice bowl.  She wanted to give this place a two.

Long story short, I guess I'll be coming here by myself from now on.  Or perhaps with some fellow yelpers who would also like to try this amazing ramen?

I didn't have any issues with the service as other people have mentioned, but the portions are very small considering the prices.  I think the ramen is definitely worth it though.",1
g5XW5RiVhykjleeRrWlJ2g,"WOW, what a fantastic Cafe! It is so rare to find authentic Japanese food, and the owner is from Japan and has been serving these dishes ever since her children were very young. I've ordered numerous entrees there, and I love the variety. I really get tired of the burgers/steak/sandwich routines, and I love there are different kinds of food here- and not one 
item has yet to disappoint me. Don't miss this gem of a place

I enjoyed sitting in the back garden with the pretty flowers and trellis. It was intimate and relaxing.",1
g5XW5RiVhykjleeRrWlJ2g,This is an authentic Japanese / English restaurant. The owner is English and married to a Japanese woman. I got the ramen which cured my upset stomach and my girlfriend got the teriyaki chicken. Both were top notch. I recommend it highly if you're in the area.,1
g5XW5RiVhykjleeRrWlJ2g,"So this is definitely a mom and pop place.   I really think they run the whole thing with like 3 people.  But I'm someone who doesn't want any hype or fake appearances, just good cooking done right.  I've been there like 5 times, and I've always thought there was a lot of pride taken in the freshness and quality.  I'm mainly writing this cause I'm so fond of little places that do authentic stuff, and this one has found a place in my heart!

Cons: Plastic cups, informal atmosphere.  I don't know if it's really slow.   Most I've waited was like 30min.   But there's just like one lady making everything.  It will feel a little like you're visiting someone's home, and you can decide if that's good or not.

Pros:  You can get real Japanese comfort food!  I've been to a few places in other cities, and those places charge so much more for what they serve in Larchmere.
It feels like home cooking from your pal's mom...  I went again recently, and sat in the back garden.  It was so nice!  Felt like a laid back summer party surrounded by flowers.  Oh, they also have non-asian choices, if you're into different things.

Picks:  Yakisoba! ( If you want authentic Japanese)
Chicken Teriyaki if you want something really yummy, but not weird.  And I love the salads too...  and miso soup!!",1
g5XW5RiVhykjleeRrWlJ2g,"At long last, a restaurant that serves inexpensive non-sushi Japanese food, much like what real Japanese people eat most of the time.  This seems to be the closest Cleveland equivalent to Yoshinoya's on the west coast, except not fast food and much better.  I ordered the unagi don, broiled eel on rice, a typical summer dish.  The meal came with miso soup and a small salad, for about $10. My companion ordered the oyako don, chicken and egg on rice, another typical Japanese dish.  The rice in the unagi don was a little soft, and the soup was a little salty, but unlike many Japanese restaurants in this area the cook clearly understood authentic Japanese food.  In the garden seating area, we could actually see the plants where tomatoes for the salad were growing.  I'm coming back next time I'm at Larchmere.  Good, healthy, inexpensive food is hard to find, and this place tops my list in that category.",1
g5XW5RiVhykjleeRrWlJ2g,"We love this local establishment- it is such a nice change of pace to the many chain restaurants, and a very cute and relaxing place to dine. In the warmer spring, summer, and early fall, the tea garden is available for patrons to dine it. It is simply gorgeous, relaxing- you can tell the owner spends a great deal of time manicuring the garden. 

We have tried various entrees, and their Japanese dishes are authentic and delicious. We have tried the chicken teriyaki plate, grilled chicken sandwiches, yakisoba (Japanese pan-fried noodles), and udon (Japanese buckwheat noodles). All have been delicious. Oh, and the curry udon is fabulous! I have been to Japan, but haven't been able to replicate the flavors until coming to eat here. 

The now serve brunch- it is a full course meal, but without feeling too heavy. Comes with coffee or tea (with free refills), soup, entree, fresh fruit, and a homemade cookie for dessert. Delicious!

The owner is Japanese, and her food tastes fabulous. A hidden gem.",1
g5zVkPRW2umfpCuDkan7tQ,"Great atmosphere for a date night or to catch up with friends. On a Tuesday afternoon at around 5:30/6ish we were able to be seated right away.
We came for happy hour and the deals were so worth it! $3 draft beers and I also heard that the cocktails were great. My roommate got the shrimp tacos and the chicken tacos - which she says are her favorite. I got the Fried Chicken steam buns - which although not authentically Asian were still really good and crispy! 

Overall pros: Great atmosphere, cheap and quality happy hour, great selection of drinks, parking in the back 
Cons: If you're extra hungry or require a large serving size, you may need to order several things to get full. Personally, for me, it was the perfect serving size.",1
G9UlT-mBMdUwoUGCW405ow,"Lago is deliciouso!

In other words, it's Italian perfection in Cleveland. NOM. 

With it's super romantic interior and authentic decor, Lago truly makes you feel like you're on a mini vaca. Priceless. Nothing is better than a restaurant experience that feel like a getaway. 

On top of the visual goodies that Lago boasts, can I just say that the goat cheese tortellini was off the chain? Umm, best goat cheese experience of my life. No doubt. I crave it on a regular basis. The antipasto was the first one I've ever had and therefore set the standard for every other one I've ever tried. And trust me, they've all fallen short in comparison. 

Honestly, this is great date pick spot. It's not a cheap restaurant, but it's worth the money. The vibe is incredible and matches the deliciousness of the food. If you want to impress someone, bring them here.",1
gAZy-APHAL1vnwI5R6U4Og,"dunkin has taken over. just a few years ago, you couldn't find dunkin in AZ. then the bagged coffee started showing up in the grocery story, and before you knew it, you couldn't throw a sack of dead (insert favorite object/animal here) without hitting a dunkin donuts shop. 

yet it never seems authentic  unless i'm having one in boston. any location is as good as the other. the coffee is exactly the same...how do they know just  how much cream and sugar to put in a coffee? although that little mustached man apparently doesn't get up at the crack of dawn to make donuts, they still have a plethora of donuts. my favorite always is the powdered jelly donut, but i'm trying to avoid diabetes so i had to quit eating them. 

dunkin is extremely reliable and visible in boston (or new england). and i always find it so funny to hear some big, dirt covered construction worker order a non-fat, blended, iced, skinny mocha latte in that tough boston accent.",0
GCr0eTVnVzFE72c-VJezoQ,"The primary reason we went to Nido Italia was to hear the band, ""Disco Inferno"" on a Friday night.  Beware--over the top, white lattice backdrops scream super 80s.  The little white lights in the lattice were completely over the top.  But truth be told, the place was packed.  We were extremely surprised and pleased with the food.  We usually go to La Dolce Vita because we like their sauce, but NIdo serves up a more authentic sauce.  My boyfriend had the meat ravioli and it came bathed in an authentic meat sauce that had bone-in pork in it.  I had the rigatoni with marinara sauce and it was seriously delicious.  And lest we forget about the herb butter that was served with the warm bread.  We will definitely go back, and this may be our new favorite place in Little Italy.  Bravo.",1
GCr0eTVnVzFE72c-VJezoQ,"Amazing dinner experience! The food was delicious. Real authentic Italian food. The veal Marsala was so tender it melted in my mouth. The Marsala sauce was incredible, best I've ever had. The fried calamari was cooked to perfection and served with a homemade marinara sauce. The dinner/house salad was a beautiful blend of fresh greens with fresh strawberries, dried cranberries and a homemade balsamic vinaigrette. The food at this place is so good you'll think you died and went to heaven! Great atmosphere, lovely decor. Service is slow but just part of the experience, so sit back and relax! Definitely one of the best restaurants in Cleveland's Little Italy. Reservations are needed on the weekends, impossible to get a table without. Valet parking is available drop off and  pick up at the front door.",1
GCr0eTVnVzFE72c-VJezoQ,"They brought out the oldest toughest bread ever. I seriously wouldn't feed it to ducks.  We ate it only because we were starving and then Waited 30 min for appetizers. Stuffed peppers that have zero cheese and cost $14. I can make them so much better at home. Also got the risotto balls appetizer which was good but you only get 3 for I think $14. And do not expect the marinara to be even remotely warm, it's cold. Ugh. My husband and I split the brocollini with peas and chicken.  It came with a house salad that consisted of wilted spinach with raisins and warm lemon dressing. It sucked. Ate a very small bite and left it. The entree was good but very easily made at home. Not what I would call authentic Italian cuisine.  On top of it we sat outside on the patio where everyone goes to smoke, fabulous.  Absolutely won't be going back. Corbos for dessert was really good tho, highly recommend that!",0

GCr0eTVnVzFE72c-VJezoQ,This place is fantastic. All the food was delicious and appropriately priced. I highly recommend the veal parm. The service was exceptional as they seemed to use a team based server approach. My water glass was never less than half full. The ambiance was very authentic Italian. I had generally been disappointed in my eating experiences in Little Italy until finding this place. I highly recommend.,1
GCr0eTVnVzFE72c-VJezoQ,"Wow! Angelo's is the best Italian we've ever eaten!  The atmosphere was romantic with candlelight and Italian music. We met Angelo and he was friendly, funny, and laid back. We ordered the bruschetta with olives,
chicken Parmesan, and chicken Romano. All of the dishes seemed homemade and authentic.",1
GCr0eTVnVzFE72c-VJezoQ,"If there were 50 stars i would give it 51.
This place is the epitome of little Italy for us. From Angelo personally making sure you are having an authentic experience to the the food, AHHHHH the food. My god it's amazing: little Italy Cleveland is amazing and Nidos is the pinnacle of that. 
Don't plan to eat fast, you are cheating yourself. Come with the love of your life (like I do) and enjoy.",1
GCr0eTVnVzFE72c-VJezoQ,"We have been here twice before and seem to have the same issues every time. The meals are ""ok"" but not the authentic Italian we are searching for. We all do not like the Caesar salad dressing as it has a strong strange after taste. Each of us had different items. The gnocchi with tomato cream sauce is ok, and the chicken parmigiana with cavatelli is not very flavorful. My friend ordered the chicken fettuccine Alfredo and it also was very bland. She had to add a ton of pepper to it to give it some flavor. My daughter ordered the stuffed tilapia which was on special that night and was VERY happy with it. We will probably not return as we have gone three times and have not left being happy or satisfied with our meals.",0

GCr0eTVnVzFE72c-VJezoQ,"I live somewhere that does not have much in terms of authentic Italian, so I was really excited to try this place, especially because of the reviews. My daughter's rigatoni was good. My linguini with clams had chewy clams, 2 of the 5 were completely off and the pasta was sitting in a sea of butter. I added squeezes of lemon, chili flakes, but it was buttered noodles with no flavor other than butter. Also both wines by the glass tasted old. The server didn't really seemed bothered by either of these issues. I imagine that there are much better options on this street.",0

GCr0eTVnVzFE72c-VJezoQ,"We arrived at 5 o'clock without having a reservation waiting with another couple who did. When we saw how they were being treated with a reservation, because they couldn't find there name, we knew we were in trouble!!!! This woman said abruptly to us, ""We are full tonight we can't' take you"". She was very flustered agitated to say the least. We were going to leave when a waiter said there is a table for you. She rudely said, ""You have to be done by 6:30""!!  And I said well that's up to your kitchen!  I could not believe this woman!! A major b...ch!!! Besides all that the waiter seated us at a very nice table for two. The dining area of about 20 tables is beautifully decorated and high class. The back of the separated restaurant is for larger parties. Did not think the  food was authentic. Caesar Salad had to much dressing on it and had an after taste. My Chicken Piccata was over fried but 2 large cutlets.  My fiancÁE©' had a 12 filet that was excellent.  The asparagus had some short of cheese or breading on it with an after taste. It was not good. Over all though the waiter was good, food presentation very nice, the food was hot and we had a nice table.  I was happy that we done by 6:15!!!  LOL   I also have to say after being there from 5 o'clock to 6:15 that the tables were not full. Why would you turn customers away. We were two people.  You hold your reservations for 2 hours?",0
GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw,"Mmmmmmmm. So yummy. Friendly staff. Prompt service. This is one of those perfect ""random"" little restaurants that I love to go to. Some of the dishes really do remind me of food I ate in Asia. I appreciate them sticking as close to authenticity as possible considering they aren't in Asia! 

Dishes I would eat over and over again*: Mapo Tofu, Shui Zhu Yu (Water Boiled Fish), Ma La Niu Jin (Beef Tendon), Gan Ban Si Ji Tou (Spicy Green Beans). 

*Please excuse my spellings/rough translations!",1
GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw,"Take a cuisine known it's in own culture as being one of the best and sprinkle its delectable goodness all over Cleveland and what do you get? Szechuan Gourmet! You should be adventurous and good spirited to dine here. Here's why, you want good authentic food? Ask for the fish to be served whole. I mean the entire fish on your plate. Here's why, one of the key to good Sichuan food is freshness. Whole fish is much fresher. The other keys to Sichuan cuisine are bold use of garlic and chili peppers. So here is where the good spirited part comes in handy. Eat this meal the Chinese way. The rice you're served is your main dish. You flavor your rice with dishes you've ordered bite size at a time. It's how it's meant to be savored. They presented me with two menus when I arrive. The only thing I ordered off the menu was the appetizer. Everything else, I asked about their specialities. Their recommendation was based on the protein choice I made (fish and lamb). We also asked for a recommendation for a vegi dish. Their garlic stir-fried snow pea tips is by far the best I've had around town. It's a spicy kind of place but they'll accommodate. So don't shy away from this gem in our little Chinatown.",1
GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw,"I LOOOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!!
From a southern Chinese customer, this is as authentic as it gets!
Service is blunt and quick, great and consistent food each time. Try everything on the menu- guaranteed delicious. The waiters aren't always friendly but they get the job done and it's a busy place so can't blame them too much. They don't speak that much English but speak enough so you understand. Most dishes are spicy unless you specify or request certain preferences. Pretty much everything has MSG and salt.  There are also karaoke rooms in the back you can reserve for parties.",1
GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw,Extremely authentic Asian food. I got the spicy beef noodle soup and the beef was really juicy and full of flavor - not dry. The spicy wontons were so good too. Can't wait to go back.,1
GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw,"I really don't understand the negative reviews, it sucks you had bad service, but please give it another try, it's a new restaurant with possibly inexperienced managers.

This food here is the most authentic in Cleveland. So says my wife who spent the first 22 years of her life in China. I had the Spicy Pork Intestine soup and it was amazing. The spice mix was as good as a restaurant that I have been to that is in the top 50 in the US.

For the person complaining about bones, wanting fried rice, and wanting American Chinese dishes, yes, go to a cookie cutter American Chinese place. This is not your typical take-out Chinese place. If you want to try something new and really good, come here. In my experience, Chinese restaurants cook much higher quality food when you order authentic.

I also recommend the Spicy White Fish dish for another solid dish that is more accessible. We also had a chicken dish that I can't remember the name of, but it was too salty for my taste. Normally I would take off a star for that, but compared to all the other Chinese restaurants in Cleveland, the other two dishes amazed me enough to still give this place 5 stars. We had great service too.",1

This is an updated review I placed in March.  My wife and I have returned to Cleveland and have eaten here twice this week.  It is an authentic Szechuan restaurant attached to an import business and Chinese grocery store in a large industrial building.  Killer real Chinese food.  We had shrimps every which way...fried and salted, another dish with walnuts.  Every version was fantastic.  We had fried lotus root which was good.",1
GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw,"Since I moved to Cleveland last year, I've been searching for good Chinese food. A couple places have been alright, but I hadn't found one that blew me away...until now.

Szechuan Gourmet is my favourite kind of Chinese food. Unforgiving, unadulterated and uncompromising szechuan spice. It makes me incredibly happy to have finally found a spot that is authentic and does not water down its dishes for non-Chinese palates. I ordered an eggplant dish, the chili chicken and dried pot fish. Each one was excellent and the serving size was so large, I had enough food for my next 3 meals!

I cannot recommend this place more. I have found great Chinese in Cleveland after all!",1

They have two different menus, one of which is the americanized non-descript chinese food like you usually find a a chinese restaurant (think fried rice and moo goo gai pan) the other is traditional fantastic authentic Szechuan.  

We had the fish ""dry pot"" which was friend fish in a spicy peppery crust served with tofu, veggies, chilis in a metal wok a well as lotus root with peanuts, which is as it sounds.  The dry pot was a bit too salty for my taste, but otherwise everything was great.

We will definitely be back !!!",1

Also great is their general taos chicken and spicy green beans... but cant go wrong with anything you get!",1
GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw,"Apparently, this used to be the old Tink Holl Seafood Garden. This is the first time I've seen an authentic Szechuan restaurant in Cleveland. Good service. A little bit pricy for the food though. $40 for 3 dishes (not huge portions either - enough for 2, no leftovers). 

The tea here is really good! They give you two choices. Oolong and something else. The oolong is yummy, not watered down like at some other places. Ordered a pork dish with black pepper sauce, house special beef noodle soup, and kung pao ji ding. The kung pao ji ding was the highlight of our dinner. This is the first time in Cleveland that I've had a place actually make a real kung pao ji ding dish (not Americanized). Could have done without so many peanuts, but the overall flavors were there (with some finetuning, could have been amazing). Pork dish with black pepper sauce was a little bit salty, but overall decent. I enjoyed the bamboo shoots and jalapenos in that dish. House special beef noodle was the main disappointment of the meal. Was not expecting soup the color and consistency of what you would see in sui zhu yu. It was too oily. I'm usually someone who finishes all of the soup in pho or other noodle soup dishes, but this one, I just had to skip. Way too oily. 

Will come here again, as it is very good Chinese food for what you can find around the area.",1
GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw,"Service was friendly however, the communication barrier was a bit b of an issue.  Understandable in having authentic  szechuan food. The food was delicious but it v was hot,  hot,  hot and hot.",1
GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw,"One of the newer Chinese restaurants in the asian town area. I was skeptical about trying this place because my parents went and did not give me a rave review about it.

I decided I wanted to try it out myself and it was a good choice for a friend who enjoys spicy food. Since the first visit, I have been here more then a handful of times. 

The food is different from your typical restaurants in the area. The portions range from small to medium, dependent on what you order. The menu can be confusing...there is a dessert section, but not your typical sweet desserts. You know the food is not far from authentic cuisine when there are Chinese characters on the menu. 

They have 2 Karaoke rooms. The dining area is small and can get crowded. They have multiple large tables that can fit large parties.

I have come with friends from all cultures to try the food. My most recent visit, I came with co-workers. I was the most ""Asian"" of the group, so I earned the responsibility of ordering? Since it was a party of 3, we ordered only a few dishes: 

- Braised mushroom with Bok Choy - one of my favorite vegetable dishes here. Bok Choy is actually inexpensive to buy and cook at home, but well worth the money when dining here. It is a nice complement to the multiple spicy dishes on the menu.
- Pork with garlic sauce - I first noted this dish when glancing over at another table. Looked good, so we ordered it to give a try. A favorite of mine as well. The pork is cooked with some sort of vegetable in the potato family? Nice compliment to the meat. 
- Dan Dan Noodle - cheap and filling. Prob the spiciest dish that evening. Normally I share the noodle with someone, but I was feeling greedy and wanted one all to myself. Flat white noodle, minced spicy meat with some greens. A must try!

I recommend to explore the menu and enjoy the different levels of spice. You can always ask for less or more spice dependent on your preference. Better yet, go with someone who can speak the native tongue and let them do the ordering. Sit back and enjoy the meal with a glass of water on the side!",1
GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw,A little pricey but great food. Szechuan dry chicken is amazing. Worth the additional money if you want authentic Szechuan.,1

Everything was delicious.  They take their time serving the meal and the service is indifferent.  This must be a signature of authentic Chinese restaurants.  It reminds of the restaurants in Flushing, NY.  Great food, bad service.

Make sure you have plenty of time.  Last time with eight colleagues, lunch took two hours.  Still, everyone I've gone with are willing to put up with the service for the food.  I'm going back today.",1

GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw,"Going to give it 5 stars. Was home for Christmas. Love the Szechuan Gourmet in Ny & Flushing, Queens. Had no idea there was one in Cleveland. I was skeptical at first but the reviews, photos, & menu items sounded legit so i made a reservation for me & my family who is not familiar with authentic Szechuan food. We were seated right away. It wasn't horribly busy so there was always a server available to get us anything we needed. I ordered for everyone. Szechuan dumplings, dan dan noodle, mapu tofu, spicy cucumber, pickled vegetable, fried green peppers (huge fan), jelly noodle with spicy bean sauce (awesome but gelatinous) , tripe in spicy sauce (i always order this), spicy green beans ( great complimentary veg to go with everything else), fried frog leg pot, & spicy boiled fish pot (fish pot was excellent). Everything was legit. This stood up very well to the authentic places in nyc. It's obvious the chefs know what's up. My family was thinking everything would be too hot, or too ""weird"", but they were pleasantly surprised with the flavors & the manageable heat. They did sweat a little but they basically were able to manage it with water & rice. Haha. I don't need rice. I want all the flavor & spice. No filler. So happy i can get my Szechuan fix when i come home. If you need advice ordering here, use my order as a guide. Don't get run of the mill Chinese here. I guess if you're new to this, the jelly noodle & tripe texture may be too much, or the fried green peppers may be overbearing but i love it. Enjoy, this place is the best in Cleveland as far as i know. Will be back for the Hotpot! Shout out to the staff, they took care us.",1

Their spicy lamb dish is awesome, and I am a big fan of one their Lotus root dishes as well. Get something green and garlicy to combat some of the spice and you'll be good to go.  

They also have a larger room in the back if you want to host a party with some limited and mostly Chinese karaoke in the back, but you better bring a lot of hungry people as there is a minumum spent charge.  

I still can't decide if I like this place or Wonton Gourmet around the corner more, so I just go to both once a month.",1
GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw,"Unique and delicious!

My girlfriend and I visited Szechuan Gourmet for the first time yesterday and were very impressed. We were initially drawn to Szechuan Gourmet because it was beside the Asian Grocery we typically shop ""Tinkholl"", and secondly by the distinctive dishes displayed, on the menu in the entry way. I was glad to see that the menu contained many dishes, not typically found on other menus. I ordered the Beef Stomach with vegetables and hot pepper, my girlfriend chose the Eggplant in Black Bean Sauce. When looking at the menu, my initial impression was that the meals were a little highly priced, however when our meals arrived, that thought was quickly gone. My dish arrived in a large well heated metal bowl and my girlfriend's dish arrived in a large glass pie pan, from reading other reviews, most dishes are family portions, made to share. The Beef Stomach with vegetables and hot pepper, contained a good amount of tripe and a good variety of vegetables (two full meals with leftovers) and had a spiciness that made my brow sweat, just as I had hoped. All too often spicy dishes do not live up to their description, however the Beef Stomach with vegetables and hot pepper did not disappoint. Beyond that, the Tripe was very flavorful and tender, not typical of most tripe dishes. Also, the broth was very unique and flavorful paired nicely with the slight sweetness of the Tripe, would definitely order again! The dish my girlfriend selected, the Eggplant in Black Bean Sauce was also very good. This consisted of three whole eggplants sliced in quarters long ways, lightly breaded, pan fried. The Eggplant was perfectly seared and crispy, not at all soggy as can be the case when cooking Eggplant. Additionally, the Black Bean Sauce was quite dynamic both slightly sweet and spicy and different than Vietnamese Black Bean dishes I had tried. I would definitely would order the dish for myself. I can't wait for my next trip to Cleveland to try another dish!      
Finally, we were very pleased with the service. Our servers were prompt, friendly and helpful in deciding from the large menu, we were not left waiting for anything. If you like a unique authentic meal definitely try the Szechuan Gourmet we will definitely be back!",1
GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw,"This place has some of the best authentic Sichuan food I've ever had, eclipsing even the Sichuan restaurants I've tried in San Francisco's chinatown. Service can be a little slow (though not frustratingly so), but your patience will be rewarded. Dishes feature the trademark chili-oil-slick and spicy-yet-numbing taste of Sichuan food - which may sound undesirable if you're not familiar with authentic Sichuan cuisine, but I assure you these are marks of quality so don't be afraid to dive right in. Even the complimentary hot tea is a strong, earthy, authentic Pu-Erh which I could drink by the pot if given the opportunity. Prices are also very reasonable, so there's no excuse not to throw caution to the wind and try an appetizer or two, or an interesting-looking dish that you may not be able to pronounce. This place is absolutely one of very few Cleveland restaurants I would legitimately call diamonds-in-the-rough. A trip to Szechuan Gourmet is much cheaper than a plane ticket to China, but you'll swear you're there from the very first bite.",1

GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw,I'm originally from Szechuan so I think I'm a fair judge of Szechuan cuisine. Most of the dishes here are authentically Szechuan. What makes this place authentic is their red chili oil which is used in almost all hot dishes. In fact Szechuan chili oil is not just chili and oil. It contains a mixture of different flavors extracted from spices herbs. Some so called Szechuan restaurants don't prepare the oil this way. But not this place! I'm pretty sure chefs at Szechuan prepare their red hot chili oil the traditional way because I can taste it and actually saw pieces of spices/herbs in the food.,0
GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw,"I was ready for this seedy-looking restaurant (from the outside) next to a Chinese grocery to wow my dad and I. I wasn't expecting it to be priced so highly. But if you go with the right people and pick the right dishes, you could be paying for two meals at the same time.

A note on payment before I continue: while they accept card, the cash price is 10% off your meal. It might be worth your while to stop by the ATM first!

The immediate proximity of ethnic grocery stores is usually a pretty good place to start looking for authentic cuisine. My dad saw the word ""Szechuan"" and instantly began looking for å¤«å¦»èEºçEE, or Husband and Wife's Sliced Lung translated literally. On the menu is a more accurate description of the dish, Beef Tripe and Tendon w/ Chili Sauce (it also has peanuts). This is a classic cold appetizer, and according to him, is how you judge the authenticity of a self-proclaimed Szechuan restaurant. After that, we were a little bit at a loss because of how extensive the menu is. Their favorites menu (with pictures) and a waiter helped narrow it down a little, and we ended up with Seaweed Soup w/ Dried Shrimp and Winter Melons, Ground Pork w/ Cellophane Noodles, and Three-Style Pepper Chicken. The last one was by far our favorite - a bunch of crispy, chewy popcorn-chicken-sized bites of meat. The pepper to chicken ratio actually approaches 1:1, and first timers should watch out for the little Szechuan peppercorns. If you've never experienced the numbing effects of peppercorns, I suppose now would be the time to try. We were pretty disappointed by the Ground Pork (è",1
GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw,"4.5 stars...
The chef is from Chengdu - and while perhaps not delectably balanced, the flavours are authentically Sichuan.  I would agree with Cory R that the servers are still figuring out service, but after a little tinkering they managed to get my party and another party to share a table given that they have precious few tables set for parties of two.

We ended up ordering Huiguorou, Malaxianggan, dandanmian, Bairou, mapo tofu... all very legit standards at a Sichuan restaurant.  We even asked the waiter why the menu was in traditional chinese.  His response - more chinese in CLE use traditional...

That said, the patrons were nearly all from the mainland...  

Which tells you volumes.

Portion sizes are mainland-ish, and flavours as well.  

I enjoyed the meal thoroughly, and will go back when I'm in the mood for this particular sort of food.  The decor is pedestrian, but  the place is more or less a hole in the wall.  They also have a karaoke room with an authentic east-asia karaoke song set.

Very impressed - and it's really without competition here.",1
GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw,"This is by far my favorite Chinese restaurant in Cleveland. 

I love coming here with either a huge group of friends to take advantage of the karoke rooms (feels just like you're in China), or just with a friend or two for a late night snack. Their food is always authentic and the service is so FREAKING fast. 

One time, my co-workers and I were so hungry that we called ahead while we were in the car (about 5-6 minutes away), ordered and when we got to the restaurant, our food was sitting waiting for us. Piping hot and delicious (as always). 

The owner is especially nice and takes good care of his customers. He always has good recommendations and really seems to have a genuine interest in the dining experience of his customers. 

Best part is, if you pay with cash, you get 10% off your entire bill!",1
GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw,"Being Chinese, I have pretty high expectations when it comes to Chinese food.  I've been looking for a place that sells authentic æ°´çE®é±¼ Sichuan poached sliced fish in hot chili oil like I had in China when I was living there.  I was hoping this place had it and they do! It's very tasty, not just spicy.  My preschooler loved it too, so it is definitely not overly spicy (I have a very high tolerance for heat!)

Make sure to check the specials for the week on the right side wall upon entering otherwise you might miss out on some great dishes!

Owner is very friendly, as I didn't bring my cell phone and he let me borrow the restaurant phone and was very nice about it.  

Their house fried rice wasn't anything to write home about, but then again, fried rice is not the signature dish of Sichuan food...

Definitely returning and introducing friends to this great gem of a restaurant!",1
GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw,"Oh baby! That was one amazing meal. I ordered the spicy wonton and mopo tofu and it hit all the right spots. Szechuan food is known for spice level and that can be intimidating to the layman, but the spice in these dishes was extremely flavorful and added versus subtracted from its deliciousness. Although the mopo tofu has small bits of pork in it, it isn't the meat that makes the dish. Surprising to my carnivore senses, the texture of the tofu and the tasty chili sauce it is seeped in are the true stars of the show. 

Also, not being a connoisseur of szechuan food, I was skeptical as to whether it would just be a normal general tso's chicken type of meal. Szechuan Gourmet is not that - I may not know exactly what authentic szechuan is, but this stuff tasted great!",1
GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw,"Quality, chinese food, quick, in a no frills yet very clean setting. There is a fish tank with live fish and lobsters in the back that just shows how fresh the food is. All of the chicken was quality meat, and I could not find any gross, or low quality pieces. I also asked for them to make a dish more mild, and it still had great flavor, without overpowering my mouth with spice.

Great service, food, and promptness. Only complaint is that it is so authentic, that there are no descriptions for the menu items so I had a hard time picking what to order. Scope out the menu before.. Everyone in my group LOVED the Lo Mein noodles. Wonton soup also had amazing flavor. I will definitely be returning.",1
GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw,"Great authentic Szechuan food in Cleveland.  Even the black tea is delicious!

Recommended highly!  My wife and I had the basic salt & pepper crispy tofu, walnut shrimp and spicy wontons.

Plus the requisite high energy Chinese ambience!",1
GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw,Most authentic and best quality Chinese food in Cleveland!!!! The restaurant I most look forward to the most when I come back from college. Highly highly recommend shui Zhu yu and hui Guo rou,1
GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw,"One of my favorite Chinese restaurants in Cleveland, hands down! There is no better place for spicy, authentic Chinese food, and they even have karaoke here! Szechuan Gourmet is located next to Tink Holl market, and although it doesn't look very fancy it makes up in that department with their delicious food. On top of that, they are open fairly late, so you can sing and eat til' your heart's content. 

My favorite dishes: spicy bean noodle, sauteed loofah with mushroom, lotus root with peanuts, dan dan mien (noodles with minced pork soy bean paste), fish filet with veggies and hot peppers, and the salt and pepper crispy prawns. I've also had the ma-po tofu, dried pot- intestines, dried pot- lamb, braised eggplant, and giant grilled prawns on skewers (this is not on the menu, it's a special request item). 

All the food here is pretty delicious. Although I've been here many times, I'm still trying out new dishes! It's a great place for groups as well, and if you spend enough they allow you to use the KTV room for free! The place is usually busy, so you can tell the food must be good!",1
GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw,"If you are looking for American Chinese food, please don't step in this restaurant. It is not like those Chinese takeout places. If you are really looking for the Szechuan style food, hot, spicy, heavily seasoned dish and even KTV ( Karaoke in a private room)come here, it will not disappoint you. 

Best Szechuan food in Cleveland. Food is pretty authentic and service is tentative. They recently extended their service hour until 1am. That makes me super excited. I usually come with friends who can tolerate super spicy food with family style to share and taste different dishes. 
Don't forget to order ""qing-dao"" beer. It goes so well with those spicy food...... 

My recommendation will be beef tripe & tongue in hot pepper sauce, Szechuan fired chicken,  dried pot series, pork belly cold appetizer, and my favorite non-spicy veggie dish is loofah w. Fungus and mushroom

Yum.... I am hungry again.",1
GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw,Really nice restaurant. We enjoyed the food a lot. I agree with most other reviewers that the Szechuan food here is the most authentic around Cleveland area.,1
GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw,"This place has fantastic service and, more importantly,  delicious food. If you're looking for takeout in boxes, then go to panda express. This place has authentic food that rivals most chinese restraunts I've been to in China. Their chef is from the Szichuan province and makes food that I crave everyday. This fuckboi jeff b down below obviously does not understand quality.",1

Skip the typical American Chinese food on the first pages of the menu and ask the waitresses (who speak decent English) what to order, or take some advice from the reviewers below.

Would be great if they had a picture menu to order off, but I'm pretty happy taking other folks advice as well.",1
GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw,"I've heard of this restaurant from my Chinese friends but have never set foot in it because of its reputation of uber spicy dishes. Fear thee not, my fellow foodies who can't take any level of spicy-ness! I'm writing this review just for you.

My dining partners today can not eat spicy food. Luckily the menu graphically indicates 3 levels of spiciness on all the dishes. There were still quite a lot of choices for you non-spicy eaters. 

I usually don't write review on my first try of the place, unless I'm with someone who has the authority to comment on the authenticity. Today I was with my mom, whose family was from northern China. They regularly make dumplings, buns, noodles, scallion pancakes at home. Hence my mom is firstly picky about Chinese food in general, and secondly particularly picky about any food made from dough. When I took her to Indian restaurants she'd comment on the naan too.

We ordered:

- wontons in clear broth
- steamed dumplings

Mom approved both. She said the dough must've been made fresh in house. The fillings were solid, if anything perhaps lacks vegetable. 

It's hard to get her approval on dumplings. She did not approve the dumplings at Hunan Solon because the dough was too ""powdery"". 

- woodear and silk melon: the flavor profile is bright and light, not your usual Szechuan flavor. It's good to know that a heavy flavor restaurant can do light flavor dishes well. 

- fried tofu in brown sauce: mom said the quality of the tofu is good. I like this dish.

- country style lamb: it was not what we expected. We thought it was going to be dry, but it came with gravy and lots of onions. It's not bad though.

Overall all five dishes we ordered today had mom's approval. She thought this restaurant hasn't Americanized it's favors yet. I hope it continues this way.

Here we are, I realize we were not the typical customers; came to Szechuan but requested everything to be non spicy, greasy, salty. This is a place I will go back and try some level 1 spicy dishes next time.",0
GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw,"This is probably the first true authentic Szechuan cuisine I tasted. I had a pretty good service from my server. She was very suggestive on menu choices.

We ordered a bunch of dishes and enjoy everyone of it. It look wickedly spicy but it's not. The szechuan peppers gives you that nice flavor spicy sensation that goes away after the meal. The flavor is really good. We ordered the diced rabbit and peanuts. The flavor is great but I don't care too much about being so bony. The beef tripe and tongue in hot pepper is really delicious. The tongue taste like beef pot roast. Everything sliced paper thin. The ""Dried Pot"" has different meat choices and we picked beef. Delicious cooked with bean sauce, szechuan peppers, lotus roots, big bean sprouts, seaweed, dried tofu. As long as I don't eat the big red chili pepper, the dish is fairly good. 

I will definitely go back and try some more different dishes.",1
GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw,"I'm just a suburbanite from Cleveland, Ohio so what do I really know about ""authentic"" Chinese food? Admittedly, not much, but if you're idea of Chinese Food is Panda Express, Mark Pi, or anything else that you may find at the mall food court, then it might be time to expand your horizons a bit and check out some ""real"" Chinese.

Szechuan Gourmet has some of the best menu selections. Sure, you can have orange chicken, or Hunan beef, or Kung Pao this or that, but if you're willing to take a chance and dive a little deeper, your senses and taste buds will be introduced to a whole new level of Chinese food at Szechuan Gourmet. Dry pot chicken, for example, is one of the best chicken dishes I have ever tasted. It's spicy, but not just for the sake of being spicy. The spices and peppers incorporated into the dish provide a tremendous palate pleasing experience. Another dish that I absolutely love is the Boiled Fish in spicy Szechuan sauce. Delectable pieces of tilapia filets boiled in exactly that, a spicy Szechuan sauce, with cabbage and other veggies stewing at the bottom of the bowl. 

Most dishes are meant to be enjoyed ""family style"" with portions big enough for at least two; maybe three. I usually go with a friend or two and select a main dish and a vegetable to be shared with the table. I've never left hungry. 

It's a little off the beaten path, and you may have your trepidations walking in, but I promise you that once the food starts coming, those fears will be lost to a distant memory and you'll be enjoying some of the best Chinese food that you've ever had in the CLE.",1
GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw,"I'm pretty happy after visiting this restaurant.

Came here with a friend for dinner. We both were up for spicy food and we were happy to find that it was authentically spiced!! (Friend: I usually have to ask for sriracha. I didn't have to tonight.) we both thought it could go even hotter though. Bring it on!!

We had the dandanmien, fried pork intestine (with at least 2 kinds of hot peppers) and a fish with tofu hybrid dish that they made just for us upon request (edited note: it was not very good). Dandanmien was delicious and I think my fav out of the three. 

Everyone who came in was Chinese/Asian--good sign for authentic food. I even ran into some friends. I just wish my mandarin was better...

We will be back to try more. Just typing up some brief notes for now.",1
GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw,"Nothing fancy about this local and authentic restaurant, but I would rate it as one of the best meals of my life. A friend and I shared dry pepper chicken, garlic eggplant, green beans, and dumplings. I am drooling just thinking about them! Flavorful and authentic - the friend is currently in China and says she is often reminded of our meal here. I will be back and begging everyone to come with me as often as possible.",1
GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw,"Szechuan Gourmet adds to the list of great reasons to visit Cleveland's fantastic and growing Asiatown community.  This new-ish Chinese restaurant is next door to the Tink Hall Asian market and makes a convenient place to eat, then shop.  Being Szechuan style, many of the dishes have ""heat"" spiced with dried red peppers and hot oils.  They do have dishes that are milder for those that do not enjoy flame on their tongues!

Overall, I recommend the restaurant and will be back -- just be armed with plenty of water and all is well.  We had a larger party of 14 (including kids) and just barely fit into their tiny party room.  One advantage of eating with a large group is being able to order many varieties of dishes to share family-style (the ONLY way to eat at traditional Chinese restaurants is to share - thus the convenient rotating ""lazy-susan"" table top).  

I'll post photos of most of our dishes:
1. Fish Dried Pot (O1) - my favorite dish of the evening.  It has fried fish that is mixed with veggies, herbs, and a ton of peppers.  Very Good.  Recommended.
2. Beef Dried Pot (O1) - Good, but not as good as the above.
3. Seaweed Soup with dry shrimp and winter melon (E7) - tasty start of the meal.
4. Dried mushrooms (that are reconstituted) with Bok Choy (V6) - I love traditional Chinese mushrooms -- delicious.
5. Eggplant in Garlic Sauce (T3) - cooked just right.  The eggplant was not overcooked so it was not mushy.
6. Veggie dish - ask the server what good veggies are available.  They did not have good stock of Gai Lan (my fav - Chinese broccoli) but he recommended Dow Mew (snow pea leaves - my second fav).
7. Shrimp Ho Fun (wide rice noodles - G18) -   I usually get beef dry fried, but this was a good change.
8. Minced Pork with Cellophane noodles (T13) - It was good - loaded with spicy sauce.
9. Spicy lamb with Chilli pepper (M35) - haha.  Most of the dishes have plenty of chilli peppers - I guess this one gets extra.
10. Seafood Tofu (T9) - hard to go wrong with tofu.  Yum.  Non-spicy.
11. Chicken with Broccoli (M4) - This may sound generic, but it was tasty.  Also it was good to give our taste buds a rest from the heat with a few non-spicy dishes.
12. Chicken with bamboo shoots (U3 ??) - the only so-so dish. 

Yeah, we ate a lot!  Thoroughly enjoyed sharing the meal with friends and family.  Bring a group to Szechuan Gourmet (or any Chinese place) and share/try new  authentic foods family-style.  Enjoy!",1
GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw,"Nice mix of authentic Asian cuisine.  I went with family who really love this place.  I'm not very adventurous, so stuck to the green beans.  They are excellent!  I tasted a few other dishes, but they weren't my thing.  My family enjoyed everything!  Lamb skewers, a beef dish with lots of hot peppers, twice cooked pork, and dish with lotus root. My only complaint is that the water tasted funny.  Kind of like mildew or like a sewer.  We could also taste it in the tea. I had to go to my car to grab bottled water.",1
GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw,"One of my favorite places in CLE to go for Chinese food! They have a great lunch special - you pick your entree and get rice as well as an option of soup or crab rangoons. I like it here because everything seems homemade. I can tell the dumpling skin and noodles are fresh, as they still have a bite to them. The chicken dishes are always my go to - probably not the most authentic but I love them! I normally always get sesame chicken, but here I don't because it is made with dark meat. It's a personal preference that I dont't like, but my friends have gotten it before and loved it! I have tried the noodle dishes also, they are great and have big portion sizes! I have never left Szechuan Gourmet hungry.",1

George W Bush won't like this review... but ""Gore may.""

SG is a lovely place making decent lamb cumin. It wasn't amazing so I can't give it 5 stars and it was pretty pricy, but I did like the excellent service, and lovely decor.

The food was pretty good with an extensive, authentic menu. Not to mention the fact that they quickly changed a $100 bill for me, which not a lot of people would have done. And there's not a huge amount of authentic Asian stuff in Cleveland, so it's cool to have this place on the menu of possibilities.

At $13 it's competitively priced too (some places charge $20 for Cumin Lamb), but I only ate about a quarter of it, so that's why this review may sound like a 5 star effort, but is actually getting 4.

As for tonight, you're actually getting 8.",1
GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw,"This is probably the best Chinese food in Cleveland even though I have to visit some other Chinese restaurants in Cleveland. I've traveled to two different cities in China (in 2015) and the food here is authentic; however, I will say that the dishes I had here had too much oil.

FOOD OPTIONS -- The menu is big so you will have plenty of options to choose from. I visited last week Friday, 30 August 2019 with my friend Ami. We ordered a bunch of food to share (see attached photos). 

APPETISERS: My friend and I started off with 2 different appetisers:

1) Scallion Pancakes ($3.95) - These are mini pancakes that come in a plate of about 6 total. These are a perfect, little snack. But, once you have 2, you're be tired of all the oil

2) Lamb Skewers ($6.95) - This was the least oily dish out of everything we ate. It was a bit dry but still tasted very good. If you like lamb then you'll love them at this restaurant.

MAIN COURSE

1) Szechuan Dried Pepper Chicken with Peanut ($13.95) - This was definitely my favourite dish of the night. It came with white rice.

2) Dan Dan Noodles with minced pork and minced ($6.95) - Very delicious but also too oily. 

My only con is that the food here has alot of oil in it which at a certain point started to affect my stomach. So while the oil probably made the food taste better, I would prefer less oil. Nonetheless, I can't wait to return back to try some unique Chinese style vegetables.

I recommend ordering a few food items and then sharing them with a friend or friends. This will allow you to try several dishes at once and save money.

If you order an appetizer make sure you eat it fast.   The wifey and I ordered 4 entrees with the idea of days of leftovers - eggplant, 3 pepper chicken, lamb and a tofu/fish dish.  Somewhat hot/spicy but all part of an authentic experience.  The entrees came out one at a time but that just meant they were hot and not lukewarm.   Think we saw a new dish on our table every 3 minutes.  Not a lot of steamed rice but we didn't mind - meant it didn't get in the way of the flavors.

GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw,"I don't pretend to be an expert on the authenticity of Chinese restaurants, but I do tend to prefer places like Szechuan Gourmet, where, in true ""Stuff White People Like"" style, I'm in the minority as a patron and neighboring tables are sampling mysterious delights. I like trashy American takeout Chinese, but I realize it's not great food. Szechuan Gourmet, however, is making great food. My heat-seeking husband got a flaming cauldron of a hotpot, jammed with a pile of flounder filets, bean sprouts, enoki mushrooms, and enough peppers to light up Asiatown. The hairlike mushrooms were similar to noodles, and the fish was cooked perfectly and super fresh. I got a delicate tofu soup and scallion pancakes, and we split an order of pungent and spicy shredded vegetables. As much as we enjoyed our meal, we envied a lot of the tables around us, which were enjoying a steady stream of treats from the giant menu.

GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw,"I wanted some Asian food during my last night in Cleveland, so decided to visit this restaurant after scouting the area out (with Yelp, of course). It's tucked away in a little plaza along with a marketplace, but not too hard to find.

I came in for a rather early dinner so the place was pretty empty when I walked in, but the interior is clean and decently spacious. The host was really nice and promptly got me seated. I ordered the Shui Zhu Yu (Szechuan style boiled fish) for ~$15, which is a dish I fell in love with when I visited China a few years ago. The food came out really quickly.

Compared to what I had in China and a couple other places, the dish itself was not as good. It lacked the strong flavors and the distinctive spiciness of the mala peppers that I really look for (makes your mouth go numb!). However, I really appreciated that the food wasn't too salty (which in my opinion is a big problem in a lot of Asian restaurants), and the portion was pretty generous. 

What really made this place stand out was the hospitality and the service. I feel like Asian restaurants often have a bad reputation for aloof and bad service, but this place definitely broke that stereotype. The servers were friendly and checked in multiple times to make sure I was doing okay. They offered to pack my food to-go when they noticed that I had stopped eating. The owner even stopped by to see how I was doing! The real highlight, however, was when I was waiting outside for my uber (it was raining), and the owner himself stepped outside with an umbrella to see if he could walk me to my destination. I think that's really going above and beyond for your customers. 

If I lived in the area, I'd definitely go back for my Asian food fix. Looks like they have a big (but not overwhelming) selection of authentic dishes, and it's probably the best you'll get in the area!",1
GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw,"The positives of this place is the service is fast and responsive. The food is authentic in my estimation (the large menu is stuffed with organ meats, frog is used in multiple entrees and unusual cuts such as calf ribs appear). I tried a very tame noodle dish, which was unremarkable, bland and oily. The interior was modest and the peace was disrupted by crying children who appeared to be related to the staff using the restaurant as a daycare. It is also necessary to walk through a strange-smelling area to get to the restrooms (I turned back).",0
GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw,"5 stars as far as Asian cuisine goes! Quick, easy, casual- their food is authentic and amazing for when you're craving Chinese.

GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw,"Wow! What a pleasant surprise! I had a delivery order of Szechuan Gourmet and really enjoyed it, like a lot. More than I thought I would for taking a gamble on a place I've never been to.

We ordered the Shrimp with Broccoli, Fried Dumplings and Smoky Pork Fried Rice (and those are my favorites in that order). The Shrimp with Broccoli had giant pieces of shrimp, generous fresh broccoli and a light sauce that didn't overpower. The Fried Dumplings were super juicy and big enough to be a small meal, though they are on appetizer. They have just the right amount of pork in them.

We loved the food and will definitely order again as well as visit in the future! Big love for this authentic Asian food.",1

GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw,"Love it there! I'd recommend everything that I tried there! 3 Pepper Chicken, Mapo Tofu, egg rolls, house fried rice, bok choy with dried pepper, and shredded pork with spicy garlic sauce. 
The food is authentically flavored, prepared with fresh ingredients, and the service is quick and courteous. They even brought my date a fork when the saw him struggling with his chopsticks  even the iced tea they served had a great flavor and was of good quality. I'm definitely a fan!",1
GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw,"Great place for authentic Asian food!! I would highly recommend the dry pot here. I came here with my family and had to ask for the separate dry pot menu. It comes with 5 meats and 5 vegetables stir fried in a big pot with peppers. The lamb was excellent and some of vegetable options included black fungus, lotus root, bamboo shoots, mushrooms, and bean sprouts. The large is a pretty hefty size and could feed 4-5 people. Also, it comes at various spice levels (one, two, or three chile pepper). We ordered the two chile pepper level and this had decent spice from the peppers added into the dry pot. 
I'd also recommend the eggplant here. It's was incredible; I've never been to a place that serves eggplant that's not cut up into small pieces. It was very well cooked and the sauce on top is sweet and complements the eggplant well. 
We also ordered a beef dish with green peppers which was just okay. It was definitely not as big of a game changer as the eggplant and dry pot. Overall great place and definitely a bit of a hole in the wall find which I loved! I'll definitely be coming back again some time.",1
Ged33xMUz2TpAgzxycGfVw,"Absolutely delicious Guatemalan storefront serving food cooked with love. Many of the items are similar to El Salvadorian cuisine, but prepared differently. Expect things like tamales, yucca, pupusas, horchata, stews and Latin American churrasco prepared to order and served by a kind and helpful owner. Like all great authentic ethnic places, there isn't much to speak of regarding ambiance, but the prices are reasonable, the food delicious and the smiles contagious.",1
Ged33xMUz2TpAgzxycGfVw,"Just a little hole in the wall place that serves good food.  Located in an old storefront on Pearl just North of I-480 look for the striped awning.  Inside is a clean little dining room with minimal decorations.  The menu is simple central American food.  Since its Tuesday I had the special which is Shrimp and Fish Tacos for $2.50 each.  

The Tacos come out as small soft corn tortillas topped with the shrimp or fish with onions and cilantro; the highlight is the small bowl of salsa verde, bright green and vibrant with a hint of heat.   The shrimp and fish is griddled and delicious, with enough seasoning to make them extra tasty.  The tacos are not big, but they are well prepared and authentic.

I will try and get back to try a couple of other items on the menu.",1
Ged33xMUz2TpAgzxycGfVw,"The food is great and very authentic Guatemalan food, the service is awesome, the prices are really good. we have been there several times as a family and I think we got to order almost all of the dishes at least once and some of the favourites multiple times. I highly recommend the Ceviche, Carne Assada, fish tacos and the Burrito.

Here is a review from the plain dealer
Fantastic El Rinconcito Chapin brings Guatemalan flavor to Old Brooklyn

CLEVELAND, Ohio - El Rinconcito Chapin can be roughly translated to ""the corner Guatemalan."" It's fitting name for this wonderful little spot that opened near the corner of Pearl and Broadview in Old Brooklyn earlier this year. This is the kind of small, locally-owned corner ethnic restaurant Cleveland has been sorely missing.

ÁE The Broadview location, in the former Coney Company chili dog locale, is actually the second site for the restaurant owned by chef Engel Godinez, a native of Guatemala. Godinez has previously worked at Piccolo Mondo and as a sous-chef at the Jack Casino.

Ged33xMUz2TpAgzxycGfVw,"Came here to taste some good food with our kids and family - and to celebrate a beautiful heritage with our children. First time for authentic Guatemalan food - soooooo good!  Great selection on the menu, very good service and pricing. Loved the Horchata drink, the chorizo and the fried plantains. Actually loved everything!  Will def return and try more of the menu:). Thank you!!!",1
Ged33xMUz2TpAgzxycGfVw,"This cozy, unassuming Guatemalan restaurant is well worth a visit and I am certain that I will be going back again! We stopped in for a late dinner yesterday evening. Ravenous as we were, we got a chance to sample a number of items from the menu: 

- Garnachas: like little, open-faced empanadas on a fluffy masa fry bread - Yum!
- Chuchito: very similar to a tamale, simple preparation, delicious, fresh red sauce.
- Tacos: I tried the chicken and the asada. Asada all day! The meat was so flavorful! These are      some of the best tacos I have had in Cleveland, to be sure. 
- Quesadillas: you get it.
- Meat Platter: with skirt steak and chorizo - a truly carnivorous feast! 

We enjoyed every bite of our meal and the service was warm and attentive! I recommend stopping in here for a delicious, authentic, and affordable meal. 

Note: the proprietor mentioned that the restaurant will be moving to a new location in the next couple of weeks, so watch out for a change of address!",1
GEkDYesNiLzMA4Ib0velBg,"I absolutely love this shop, the food is amazing, the selection is wonderful, but the service is passable at best. Everyone was friendly, good vibes all around, but the shakes were severely lacking in both thickness and cookie. Unfortunately, I got my hopes up on the wonderful app, and was rudely dissapointed that it did not work. It crashed whenever I try to order, leading to a saddened mood. The lack of sandwich in my stomach made me a sad man. I hope to have to have this resolved soon, seeing as this is the most wonderful artisan authentic mom-and-pop sandwich-eria. I love this place. :)",0
gFXbeg4E6Kocm39Puqpoeg,"this used to be a very cool event, it's a shame to see it stray so far from its authenticity. new build outs for the flea bar (the owners bar, naturally) every month and thousands of dollars wasted (not to mention the environmental cost) on untreated lumber while booth prices for small businesses have skyrocketed to fund these monthly tiki huts of hers. shop the businesses, not the market.  

p.s....where did that $40,000 kickstarter furniture go?",0
GIfZNMP0oIJCje_Xp0Bgrw,"This is the place I take anyone who comes to Cleveland from out of town. I love the gravy frites because they are extremely close to an authentic French Canadian poutine. It's the best I get when I'm stateside. :) 

My only complaint is that the stoner sandwich is much too small. It's delicious and it needs to be bigger.",1

gJ4wkwiECJdAxSaupp_9kQ,"at the Crocker Park Food Truck Challenge i wanted to try the Wok N Roll truck more than any other. i've wanted a Banh Mi sandwich for a long time but whenever i see them on a menu they're always pretty expensive. since i had come for this truck only, i went ahead and splurged. 
i ordered the Banh Mi with no cilantro. i'm one of those people who hates the taste of cilantro. 
the sandwich was great. really very enjoyable. the bread was good. the veggies were good and the pork was delicious. i'll admit, though, that the pork was not what i would consider to be authentic. maybe i'm wrong but it was more of a pulled pork - the style of which you'd find on a southern style sandwich. whatever, it was great. 
i'd definitely get it again and would be interested in trying some other things at Wok N Roll.",1
Gj8ANgQ6FcWdhrpEwUsxqQ,"LOVED this place.  we had been talking about going there, but the first attempt proved unfruitful, since they were closed.  but last night we actually got to go.  awesomeness in a little place.

authentic, delicious puerto rican food.  huuuuge portions.  i had the empanadillas pollo, yellow rice, and we both got the canoa. 

aaaand we got a spanish lesson, too.
seriously- the most fun i've had dining in a long time.  the woman at the counter was so nice, so helpful, and so sweet.  and teaching us spanish as we order (because we asked, not because she was forcing it on us) was pretty freakin' sweet.

Am taino. Yo amara devolver varias veces. sin embargo, yo no debera comer all demasiado, porque mi extremo ser el tamao de Texas..

yep.",1
gm7G69c-PU5dmMotqAjcsA,"The quality is out of this world.  Had their delicious 'cream cake in a pan' today and will plan on getting more.  Their hot cross buns are huge, moist and delicious.  Their kolachky cookies are excellent and they have the cutest pink, blue and yellow basket weave Easter cakes, truly decorated works of art, small and large round cakes and they also have the more traditional lamb cakes.  Their Italian bread is the most authentic I have had in ages, just plain good.  We love this place.",1
gNER9lE1Ma9FLm9MBsvYgg,"Few breweries try let alone succeed in producing an authentic hefeweizen, and Market Garden certainly does. We were impressed and pleased with every aspect if the place, from decor to the presentation and flavor. The beer menu is excellent- few offer such a variety and fewer do lagers well. Our meal was equally well done and service was perfect. This will be a destination whenever we're in town.",1
goZV-PlwLJOB8s5O3GruxA,"Crispy Basil Tamarind Chicken is a m a z i n g.  I don't mind their prices are a little high because they are about as authentic as you're gonna get in Cleveland.  Servers are friendly, but I think they need to work on the overall ambiance.",0

Tip:  Pineapple Fried Rice -- Great!",1
goZV-PlwLJOB8s5O3GruxA,"No many how many times I have come here with my family, the food and services are always great! Food is delicious! Best service in town! What not to love about Bangkok? The devil of the sea soup is still my favorite soup ever! The Green Curry with pork is fantastic! Its not sweet like the other Thai places and this is how green curry should be! I have lived in Thailand for 2 years and this place is the most authentic!!",1
goZV-PlwLJOB8s5O3GruxA,"I love that the food here is very authentic. The place is not as big or nice looking, but I usually notice that that smaller the place the better the food taste. It's not always true but due to my experience of going out to eat, I can say that . I love the chicken sautÁE©, Pad Thai, Basil fried rice , Penang curry, mango sticky rice and best of all is the fried ice cream ! It caught my attention so that's the only picture I have for this place is the fried ice cream .",1
goZV-PlwLJOB8s5O3GruxA,"This has become my favorite place to eat out. The Pad see eaw, BangkokDuck and Bangkok Fried-rice are some of our favorites. Prices are reasonable and food is very tasty and authentic. Environment is very comfortable with many beautiful plants and decoration around the restaurant. Also, the staff are very friendly and welcoming.",1
goZV-PlwLJOB8s5O3GruxA,"I've been slacking on reviews lately (lately = about a year), but this place deserves props.  I am picky about Thai food.  It doesn't have to be authentic, although that's obviously preferred.  It does have to be good.  And the staples should be good.  If you cannot make pad thai, you are not a good Thai restaurant.  End of conversation.  Bonus points if you do cheap takeout.

Just stumbled upon this strip mall gem because I had to go to Richmond Mall, and yelped to see what was nearby to eat.  (Note - not much.)  So pleasantly surprised.  Ate in, which was quiet and simple, though had a solid 4-5 tables on a Monday lunch hour.

Tried a smorgasbord of basics just to check them out.  Spring rolls were the worst thing, which is sad, given my belief that it's hard to ruin something deep fried.  But the wrapper is more Chinese egg roll than Thai spring roll, which means way too much flavorless breading.  Filling was ok, but not recognizable as Thai either.  Then it got better.  I'm not a big dumpling fan, but these had a yummy chicken filling and a lovely sweet brown-but-not-soy sauce.  And a few pieces of broccoli on the side to actually eat, not just garnish.  Tom Kha Gai was delicious.  As good as any I've had in Thailand.  Mains of pad thai and a curry were totally solid.  (And they listen when you ask for veg with no tofu.  Give you copious amounts of actual vegetables, which I appreciate.)

I'm not saying this is the best Thai food I've ever had, but across the board I would say it's definitely the best in Cleveland.  (And I've been looking, tried Lemongrass and Mint and Ty Fun and Phnom Penh.)  Extra awesome that price points for mains are right where they should be, around $8.  (And if you get an app, the main will = two meals.  And leftover pad thai is amazing.)

If you live nearby, I highly recommend getting takeout from here on a cold winter night.  Will warm you right up.",1
goZV-PlwLJOB8s5O3GruxA,My favorite Thai food in Cleveland is here. No doubt. As authentic as they come. I will certainly be back here soon.,1
goZV-PlwLJOB8s5O3GruxA,"Best Pad Thai ever, and I've tried many others! Good portion size and reasonably priced. If you ask for the hot spice on the side, they bring you 3 options to keep at the table. The service is always great and I love the atmosphere of the restaurant, makes you feel like you are in Thailand! Never would guess you are getting this amazing authentic food in Lyndhurst!",1
goZV-PlwLJOB8s5O3GruxA,"Pretty much ruined me on all other Thai food. Crazy fresh, authentic, and made with care. Service is thoughtful and quick. Get the Crazy Noodles or Thai Paradise and make sure to try their GIGANTIC mixed drinks!",1

GREUapStr7mD3L528tefVQ,"The best in town. As the name states, he comes from Switzerland, where baking is union protected, that includes the five year training to be even allowed to call yourself a baker. The result is, you guessed it, five year study of what others do in a weekend course with a cookbook, and you can probably taste the difference.
Bread, semmeli (small rolls), croissants, authentic bretzen (""pretzel"") and cakes are absurdly delicious.
Most favourite out of everything: lemon squares from heaven.
Not to forget in the land of Cleves: staff is fantastic, polite, kind, professional, cheerful = BLISS!
Check it out! (Takes pre-orders, open early and closed late afternoon and on Mondays.)",1
GREUapStr7mD3L528tefVQ,"Zoss is a fantastic, high quality European bakery!

It is located in an unassuming brick building, and even though it faces out to Cedar Road, it is in an easy to miss location set back on Cedar Hill. I have to admit, I drove by it for years before I tried it recently after reading some stellar Yelp reviews. I am so happy I finally did!

The staff here is patient, friendly, and very helpful, and everything I've tasted here, from the papillion to the chocolate dipped cookies, has been fresh and taste of real ingredients, like butter, chocolate, etc. Nothing artificial here! But for me, there are two stand-out baked goods: the Bavarian pretzels and the palmiers. I have been craving an authentic Bavarian pretzel since I came home from a trip to Munich, and this is the only one I found in Cleveland that even comes close to that taste! Smooth on the outside, and soft and pillowy on the inside! On Fridays and Saturdays for the month of October, they are selling beautiful, oversized pretzels! Absolutely delicious! 

The palmier are so butter, flaky, crispy, and a little bit chewy. It's like a little bite of France! So deliciously fresh...I'm getting hungry just writing about them!

Zoss might be small, but it is mighty when it comes to its delightful Swiss baked goods!",1

My wife, daughter and I had three very different meals and they were all excellent.  Very authentic.  Juicy and tasty but heavy or greasy.

The service was cheerful, on time and very welcoming.  

The interior decorations are very cool--nicest I have seen in this location.  The outdoor patio is airy and comfortable.  

This will be a new favorite of the family.",1
Gs_jpJB5f3a1jCQjV7QHQA,"Atmosphere here is very fun and entertaining. At 6 two elderly gentleman got on the stage and started to play surprisingly good Spanish/Latin guitar songs. 

Happy hour here is a pretty good deal. We had empanadas. They are super fried and super good. Come out hot and crispy. Not flaky like a lot of other empanadas. I loved eating them but hated myself for doing so. 

This place specializes in arepas, so obviously, we did not get any. Instead we had one order of the soup and also two of their special hot dogs.

The soup had a mild flavor. My fiancÁE© who does not like strong flavors because she's a terrible person, loved it. She did say that she had to pick out some gristle from her chicken. That's how you know it's authentic tho",1
Gs_jpJB5f3a1jCQjV7QHQA,"Amazing happy hour.   3-6pm Monday-Friday they have half off apps and $5 cocktails.   The plantains are perfection.   Cute dog friendly patio out back. Some entrees can range from 12-25 dollar, however the food is authentic.",1
Gs_jpJB5f3a1jCQjV7QHQA,"I tried this place because of a Groupon deal so my expectations were low. But I was pleasantly surprised. Atmosphere is great. Our server, Sebastian, was very helpful and attentive. The mojitos are excellent! Food was good, although the Cuban dishes-- while yummy-- were not as authentic as I'd hoped for. But this is a Colombian/Venezuelan place so that's understandable. I will definitely be back and next time will order the most typical Colombian dishes.",1
Gs_jpJB5f3a1jCQjV7QHQA,"Great vibe, authentic music and most importantly the food was delicious. The steak arepa and maduros were very filling- I highly recommend. Their sauces are incredible- try them all! Service was pretty good too. Ready to go back and try more of their options!",1

tl;dr: make a reservation to snag a table on weekends! 

Food was good, a wide variety of arepas and other entrees, but was a little pricey for the food. I would recommend the sancocho which is definitely enough to fill you up! The patacones are also a good choice and large portion, but a little heavier. I wouldn't say the food is super authentic though. 

Overall a nice ambiance and a fun place for a meal.",1
Gs_jpJB5f3a1jCQjV7QHQA,This is one of my favorite restaurants on Larchmere. The food is good and flavorful. It taste like what I would think authentic should be.

Gs_jpJB5f3a1jCQjV7QHQA,"My friends and I drove to Cleveland just to have their food from Pittsburgh. While my friends have tried their other locations, this was my first time. My friends are from Panama and told me the food here is very authentic tasting. 

Just by walking in the door we were offered complimentary tequila shots from lime halves. I knew I'd like this place after that, halfway through our visit we were offered another! The restaurant seating area is sort of crammed and small - on Saturday night with the live band it was popular and had a line. We made it before then. We ordered fruit beer, coconut mojitos, and red sangrias - each in a jar size glass for $9 each. All pretty delicious though the mojito was very thick and had to poor water in it midway thru in order to finish it.

We had delicious meals - I attached all of my photos! Pork arepa, steak arepa, empanadas among other entrees we ordered. Excuse my ignorance I forgot what everything was called but the pork was super tender. Black bean soup was tasty! We also had flan for dessert which was a nice ending. The band, dancing, and atmosphere was awesome! Service was excellent as well. All food came within 15 mins tops. Recommend!",1
Gs_jpJB5f3a1jCQjV7QHQA,"Wow! Quite some time has passed since an experience warranted a Yelp review from me but this is it!

I was in Cleveland for work and found Barroco on Yelp and decided to check it out. This place is a gem!

I love all food types and eat a lot of Caribbean so I LOVE flavor...Barroco is the perfect blended family of all things Latin. In other words...flavor galore! 

There were so many choices I literally asked my server, who turned out to be the manager, to recommend a dish that would make me remember this place. He over-delivered!! 

The Columbian dish, Bandeja Paisa, ""from the grill"" was absolutely amazing! It had a little bit of everything...rice, beans, plantains, beef, pork, avocado, the kitchen sink...hold the egg, whatever! Way more food than one person can eat so I definitely didn't finish but if I were back at home, that would have been a nice ""to go"" plate!

There is not a single reason you shouldn't try this place and go back many times! Great service, food, alcohol...what else do you need? 

P.S. don't you dare go there and order a burger and fries...try the authentic food.",1
Gs_jpJB5f3a1jCQjV7QHQA,"Came here after reading the reviews. As a Mexican living in Cleveland, I'm always excited to hunt down latin american food. My boyfriend ordered the ""la sucia"" arepa and I ordered carne asada tacos. The tacos were OK but came with chips that were completely plain and kind of oily. There was no salt at the table (???) and the salsa that came with my tacos had a weird taste. Carne asada was mansplained to me by our waiter as being from mexico but they completely missed the obvious opportunity to serve these tacos with pico de gallo. They brought an array of sauces (one was garlic aioli??) that did not save the day. The arepa was a garlicky mess, and the ingredients were layered in such a way that each bite was too much of one thing and not enough of everything else.

If you are easily impressed by any latin american food you find, I'm sure this will be fine. If you are looking for authentic, keep looking. Not worth the price.",0
Gs_jpJB5f3a1jCQjV7QHQA,"I had pretty high hopes for this place, unfortunately we were pretty disappointed. The prices were quite high and the quality of food definitely didn't reflect that. We started with guacamole w tostones & chips. The tostones were good but the chips bordered in stale - and the guacamole was underseasoned. It really needed some salt. I had the arepa paisa which had chicharrones w a fried egg, cheese & pinto beans. The arepa itself was not fresh and was over cooked. It was hard and kinda chewy and pretty oily. The fillings had almost no flavor and they chicharrones were chewy and also unflavored. I love chicharrones but they need to be crispy and hot - these were neither. The fat was barely rendered from them and the surface was just chewy and the meat was tough. Very disappointing. Hubby had the frijoles soup and it too was disappointing. It looked delicious but really lacked any depth of flavor and was in need of salt. All of the ingredients should've made for a very savory, complex soup but this was none of it. It was kind of a basic light tomato-based soup with a bunch of unseasoned stuff thrown in. I've had authentic arepas, made by hand and filled with basic stuff and they were amazing and also very cheap - I didn't expect cheap but I expected good and hopefully authentic... sadly, these were none of that. Our meal w those 2 entrees, 2 iced teas and the guacamole app came to $46+! Sad to say it was Not worth it at all. We won't be back. :(",0
Gs_jpJB5f3a1jCQjV7QHQA,The food is delicious and the atmosphere is very friendly. Not a long walk from the bus (less than 10 minutes so can be enjoyable in the spring). Found out about this place during the Larchmere Porch Fest last year... Definitely will try to frequent more. The arepa I had (La Sucks) was filling and the maduros served as my dessert. The food feels more authentic than a Chipotle or a Qdoba. A range of price is available so pick your choice of food.,1
Gs_jpJB5f3a1jCQjV7QHQA,"Good food, okay service. The menu is very super different than anything I've seen before-- one of the reasons I wanted to come here! Very authentic. I thought everything was fairly priced, including the drinks. The arepas are not like anything I'd ever had before. Kind of like a cornbread pita? Not really but they sure are delicious! The service was not great. Took a very long time for our waitress to come over to us for the first time, then for her to come back to take our order. Took almost 20 minutes for her to take the credit card and run it so we could leave. Still happy to support a local restaurant and would still come back.",1
Gs_jpJB5f3a1jCQjV7QHQA,"Wow, what an experience!  Amazing and authentic Latin American food.  Try the guac with plantain chips, amazing.  The arepas are the star of the show, both veg and meat totally delicious.  The grilled chicken skewers are flavorful, tender, and perfectly grilled.  Yuka fries, wow!

Note: an arepa and side is enough to make the average adult really full.",1
gstmQyich5ToZPBNhSthmw,"I actually rounded up from a 1.5.  I hate to be negative, but do yourself a favor and do not go to Zdara.  Take it from a Lebanese girl...the food is not great.  Try Aladdin's or Taza for some authentic food.

I was there last night with two of my cousins (yes, a table of Lebanese ladies).  We ordered:

-Martinis- too sickly sweet (how do you mess that up???)
-Baba- oddly smoky
-Grape Leaves- the others said they were just ok
-Hummus- just ok
-Tabouli- not bad
-Kibbee- surprisingly pretty good
-Falafel- dry

And the pita bread seemed to be heated in the microwave because it got a bit hard after a few minutes.  

All in all, I won't be back.  I'm sorry to say that, but in a town with a ton of great restaurants, you need to be better.",0
GtSNTE2qMOZBlj0noCgCGw,"This is not the best Korean in town, but it will definitely do.  

On my second and third visit, I ordered the Kimchi Jigae, which is spicy kimchi, pork and tofu soup served in a hot stone pot.  Add some rice and it's delicious.  Tasted very authentic with limitless spice and flavor.  

I've also tried the Dol Set Bi Bim Bap, but something wasn't right and I found myself adding more and more sauce just to get the right flavor, which never was the case.  I have tried making it myself, so I know a lot goes into marinating and cooking all of the vegetables in a very specific way, but I'd hit up another Korean restaurant for some tasty BiBimBap (Seoul Garden)

They've got a great location in the Asian Town Center which has a variety of things to do on a crappy day.  Get some cheap produce and ethnic food at the grocery!  Watch the martial arts class! Visit the art galleries! Listen to a poetry read!
It's a fun little plaza it is.",1

I was pleasantly surprised that I could have a fast, quiet meal on a Friday evening. A hidden gem.  I also frequent Seoul Garden in Parma but this place has better pan seared spicy squid with vegetables hands down. Also the price is a little lower for a lot of the dishes i enjoy. Also the pan fried mackerel is more authentic and less greasy. If you love Korean style Jajang myun and jampong, this place makes them pretty authentic. I can't find it like this even in Dallas, TX. 

Overall,  I love this restaurant.",1

The location is a bit funny, it is on the second floor of a shopping plaza - we have rarely seen any other stores open in the building, but there still seems to be some people around. There is also the grocery store right on the first floor that we always stop at before to pick up some goodies.

The food - amazing. We have our favorite go-tos but always try something new. By far our favorite is the C4 chicken with sweet and spicy sauce, it is just phenomenal and has the perfect amount of crispiness and spice. We get this every time. We also always get their bibibop which is also cooked to perfection. I cant name everything else we've gotten, because like I said, we always try a new dish when we are there and it is always amazing - but we've tried their short ribs, octopus, etc, all great. We also have done their Miega BBQ, which is very yummy and the staff is so helpful, however their prepared dishes are so great that we usually go with those. 

Another amazing thing here is there special spicy gochuchang sauce that they have bottled at every table. We literally put it on everything and whatever it is, it is just SO GOOD. 

The other amazing news is the ~7 authentic side dishes come with everything. They change it up based on what is available, in season, and it is great to taste the new concoctions they come up with. We always love each and every one of them. 

The other great thing I love about this restaurant is the staff and authenticity. It is family owned and all the recipes come from the grandmother who splits her time from this restaurant to her other one in Korea (can't remember which town). They also are so so sweet and accommodating. Everything she makes is so authentic and delicious, i cant say enough about it. JUST GO and be so please :)",1
GtSNTE2qMOZBlj0noCgCGw,"The food are pretty good and authentic, their Barbeque is the best among other courses and is a must try. The Barbeque machine is super easy to use and smoke free. Price is fair consider how the food taste. The waitress lady is very nice too. I give 4 star because of the taste and price.",1
GtSNTE2qMOZBlj0noCgCGw,"If you're looking for an authentic Korean restaurant, this is not the place. But the food here is still pretty good! Some items I've tried include jap chae, dokboki, galbi. and seafood pancake. The first three items are a lot sweeter than the same dishes I've tried in other places. I still recommend them though! The seafood pancake is a must! At about $7, the pancake is really filling and has a ton of seafood in it! 
If you have a large group coming, you can reserve the room down the hall from the main restaurant! That room has a pretty swanky karaoke machine with music from all genres and different Asian countries!",1
GtSNTE2qMOZBlj0noCgCGw,This spot definitely has *better Korean food than other places in Cle. But by no means an authentic experience.  Satisfying for a quick Korean food fix though!,0
GtSNTE2qMOZBlj0noCgCGw,"Don't know why this place was so empty when I went to dinner here earlier this week.  I'm not a good judge of the authenticity of Korean food given that most of the restaurants I've been to are all in Cleveland, but I thought the food tasted pretty good.   I really liked the kimchi scallion pancake, which was tasty but not too greasy.  My friends and I ordered the Korean barbecue with two different cuts of meat - the pork belly and the sliced beef.  Extra points for the service that night - the restaurant was empty, so the waiter stuck around to cook all of our meat for us.  One thing that I would want more of were the side dishes - while decent, other restaurants serve a much larger variety.  The waiter informed me that the owners may be installing tabletop grills soon.  I told him to persuade the owners to install charcoal tabletop grills - if this happens, I'll definitely be dropping by more often.",0
GtSNTE2qMOZBlj0noCgCGw,"I really like this place as an alternative to rising grill (which has an insane wait during dinner hours). There are less banchans but they are all made well. My favorite is the kimchi and spinach. 
As far as meats the galbi, bulgogi, and pork were excellent. Large portions with a great authentic marinade. 
We also got the seafood pancake which is ginormous and delicious. The pork soondabu is thicker than most places but still delicious I just wish their ""spicy"" was actually spicy. 
They cap off the meals with a frozen yogurt drink which takes me back to childhood. 
I definitely would come back here.",1
GtSNTE2qMOZBlj0noCgCGw,This is one of my favorite places on earth. My brother and I spent a month in Korea and these dishes are dead on authentic. Chap chae is on point. Plus the service is fantastic. After four years of eating here I'm finally writing my first yelp review simply to throw this place 5 stars. Don't sleep on this one. Also it's BYOB. Such a gem.,1
GtSNTE2qMOZBlj0noCgCGw,"I wasn't going to try this place because of the existing reviews. Luckily, the two other Korean restaurants we tried first were closed. The food at Miega is super authentic and the service was wonderful!

They provided 9 different small appetizer dishes while we waited for our food. The waiter was so generous, offering a refill each time our bowls were low. For dinner, I had the tofu kimchi stew and it was so flavorful! 

The only challenge was finding the restaurant. It's located on the second floor of the Asian Town Center.",1
GtSNTE2qMOZBlj0noCgCGw,"Sigh. I heard Miega gamed it's fame when it had a booth at the Cleveland Asian Festival and was asked to start a restaurant. Because of that, I was really excited about their food. Sad to admit, it's not that authentic and Seoul Garden out in Parma is still way better.

Pros: good amount of good, nice variety of sides
Cons: not authentic enough, their food is a bit on the sweet side (specially the apChae), service was slow. 

Side dishes-- my favorite part of Korean restaurants are always the sides. Miega has one of the better variety of side dishes in Cleveland. Sadly, it's still not as good and as much as Seoul Garden's. And, if my friend and I didn't ask for their steamed egg side dish, they wouldn't have brought that out... which indicates a bit of bad service or frugality? 

Entree-- I love that they give big portions for the Kalbi but it didn't taste very authentic and it was a bit too sweet for me. The Japchae was the same-- big portions, but a bit sweet.

I think Miega is a decent Korean restaurant in Cleveland, but it could be better.",0
GtSNTE2qMOZBlj0noCgCGw,Great food here. Tucked away in a multi purpose bldg off of Superior. 2nd floor. Expensive but lots of delicious authentic Korean food. Try seafood pancakes!!!,1
GVTL5nxjlhzdXJMy4-4HBA,"Prices are slightly higher than our usual place, but it is worth it, not only because of the quality but also because the servings are huge (at least in the combos).

Wifey had Bourbon chicken (~$7) while I got the Thai Chicken (~$7). I was intrigued to see what that would be, as there is no actual recipe for Thai Chicken and should be labeled Thai-style (just like Szechuan should be). I expected something that was both spicy and sweet with a hint of savory. I even requested extra spicy, because I love it and because I have yet to find a place in this city that actually makes things spicy. And what I got was close to expectation, but not spicy. Still quite good. 

The pork egg roll that comes with the combo was not only hot, but not greasy! Crab Rangoon (6 for ~$4) came with a fairly authentic sauce (not La Choy at least) and contained a fair amount of crab (or imitation crab). The Egg Drop Soup (~$2) was actually made correct - not just an egg mixed into chicken broth, but a velvety mix of egg yolks and soup, almost like hollandaise.

Staff is very nice, albeit difficult to understand at times. Online ordering solve that issue though.",1
GVTL5nxjlhzdXJMy4-4HBA,"I've eaten at Sun Sun twice now and both meals were good.  The meals taste authentic and they use quality ingredients.  Today, I had the Chicken Chow Mein and it was good.  Since I never know what to expect when I order Chinese, today was no exception.  I thought I ordered something with a dark brown, spicy sauce, but it ended up being a clear sauce.  It was still good.  Egg roll was really good.

The fried rice is dark brown with chopped green onions and has a pretty good taste.  It's not nearly as good as Dragon Gate, but it's decent.

$13 for two lunches with water.

Recommend!",1
gw0ZS5b5RP3Lzr1BoCbALg,"Ok... if I had written this review a week ago, it would have received a 4 star rating easy. However, my last visit there left me severely unimpressed.

Charkha is an Indian Restaurant in the downtown w9th area of Cleveland, and it serves it good, authentic North Indian cuisine at a reasonable price. I've been to this place several times, and I usually really enjoy the food and service!

However, during my last visit, everything, well, sucked! The chutneys were watery, the Mango Lassi was pure ice and did not seem to have any Yoghurt in it, the Paneer Pakoras were luke warm, greasy as all hell, and seemed to have been Microwaved...

The Paneer Tikka (not tikka masala) was dry, unflavorful and was served with charred paneer and uncooked onions... Only saving grace was the Malai Koftas!

I'm chalking my last visit down to a night off - till now they have delivered usually good service, and one bad one. I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and go back - and hopefully they redeem themselves! Look for an updated two star (if they repeat their last performance) or a 4 star (if they are back to being awesome) review on this place...",0
gw0ZS5b5RP3Lzr1BoCbALg,"I live right across the street from Charkha and I was ecstatic when it opened up. I've eaten there three times now and I was very impressed every time. Their vindaloo is excellent (and very spicy!), their Daal is very authentic, and they make amazing Samosas. I was a little disappointed in the Pakoras, but everything else has been spot-on. The food is quick, the service is great, and it's nice and spacious inside. Absolutely worth a try if you're in the warehouse district. I recommend it!

The service is good, too; we ordered some appetizers to put out at a party we were having and they gave us free rice pudding.

As a note, it is still getting put together, empty TV brackets in a few spots, and there is a bar but they haven't worked out the liquor license yet as of this writing.",1
gw0ZS5b5RP3Lzr1BoCbALg,"I was excited to try a new Indian restaurant, as there are not many in the Cleveland area.
The food was DELICIOUS. We went through the buffet -- although it was small, with maybe 4 or 5 main dishes to offer, with a few sides and a sub par salad. Everything was hot and fresh.
The service was HORRIBLE. I sat at a table for at least ten minutes before anyone noticed me - and then the only reason we were served our beverages, is because my boyfriend waved down a server and asked her to kindly bring us water!!
Our plates from the buffet sat at our table for sometime, before we moved them to the table beside us -- and then they were cleared.
For the price --- this place is a steal - especially with 1/2 off BEER on Wednesdays.
Also -- for an authentic Indian restaurant, why were there (what looked to be) mexican chefs in the kitchen?",0
gw0ZS5b5RP3Lzr1BoCbALg,"Very nice, tasty and fresh tasting naan!  We were extremely happy with every thing from service to simple ambience to food .
We tried mostly vegetarian. Started with the chicken soup, then we ordered Paneer Pakora , garlic and peshawari naan, paneer chilly and bhindi masala. 

Loved Naan
Loved chicken soup ( tasted very indian)
Paneer Pakora was very good
Curries were okay but with two suggestions :

Paneer chilly had too much tomato ketchup taste but it was crispy and nice. Bhindi masala didn't have enough ""okra"" in it. 

Over all, it was not really the best I ever had but its better than Saffron Pinch we tried earlier. May be , relatively it is best for Indian cuisine in Cleveland since I have not found one yet.

The tip would be to stick to authentic Indian cuisine for chefs rather than solely trying to modify to suit the audience. Although, by far, this was close to authentic.",1
gw0ZS5b5RP3Lzr1BoCbALg,"Wow, really great Indian food.  Chicken Vindaloo, Paneer with vegetables, and the BEST thing on the table in my opinion?  The Garlic Naan bread with mango chutney.  It was the best Naan I've ever had...they must bake it in a clay or woodfired oven.  Even the serving dishes are authentic Indian (love that the rice comes in a small pail with a handle).  Service was attentive.  They are still waiting on a liquor license and TVs to be put on the wall.  My guess is they have a pretty solid lunch crowd and even stronger takeout.  This restaurant is a huge.  The servers definitely get a workout walking from the kitchen to the front of the restaurant.  I hope people support this place because the food is really outstanding and we need more places like this in the Warehouse!",1
gw0ZS5b5RP3Lzr1BoCbALg,"I came to this place with some friends to celebrate a birthday and it was really great! The food was really authentic, and I got a somosa, garlic naan as well as chicken tikka masala. 

The service was kind rough though because they just wouldn't come over and were slow to bring out the food which knocked it down the star. 

It is a very tiny restaurant and very cute though, so I think that it is worth going if you are okay with being pateint.",1
gw0ZS5b5RP3Lzr1BoCbALg,So pumped this place opened near my office! Finally authentic Indian food in Downtown Cleveland. Definitely order the chaat and gajar halwa!,1
gWz6E7v0i403_t8Ntor5JQ,"Well, we were so curious to try the food (my husband lived in Greece for a summer and has never seen tyrokafteri on a menu in the States) we returned. Thankfully we were not disappointed! 

Our server was friendly and attentive. Moreover, the food was fantastic!! I probably wouldn't return on a weekday for lunch and I'd be skeptical about the dinner rush but overall we would definitely return as the food was great & definitely authentic!",1
gWz6E7v0i403_t8Ntor5JQ,"I met some friends here for lunch last week. ÁE One had been here before and recommended it to us as authentic Greek with a twist. ÁE She is Greek so we trusted her.ÁE

gWz6E7v0i403_t8Ntor5JQ,"Really amazing in house made Pita, great flavor on their dry rub wings, and beautifully updated Greek style upholstery.  Count me in.  It's one of the first upscale authentic Greek places I've been to, and it does a great job.  Fresh flavors and a cool atmosphere.  Now if only the staff were sports fans, I asked them to put on the Cavs game like 5 times before they figured it out, but they were busy and it was loud in there, so nothing too offensive.",1
gWz6E7v0i403_t8Ntor5JQ,"This place is the BEST Greek food in Cleveland. My boyfriend and I are both Greek and love eating authentic Greek food. The lamb shank, grape leaves and musaka are amazing.",1
gWz6E7v0i403_t8Ntor5JQ,"When trying true greek for the first time i was pushed to come here, i need to thank that person with another dinner from this place! The Saganaki (sp?) was incredible, the flavor explosion in my mouth was so welcomed.  I also tried the seafood stew which was out of this world.

The inside has the beautiful ""blue"" feel that i would expect in a greek restaurant, makes me feel like im looking over santorini. Ahhhh. SO relaxing and inviting. romantic and casual at the same time. Open and spacious inside, with a well stocked bar. Friendly servers.

The price was a little higher than your typical restaurant but totally worth every single penny.  The portions are large enough to share, so that cuts the cost aspect in my head.

the food is about as authentic as you can get without a passport so enjoy!!",1
gWz6E7v0i403_t8Ntor5JQ,"I wanted to thank everyone at Santorini.  I had a small wedding dinner with 16 of my family members and ordered A LOT of food.

Well done!",1
gWz6E7v0i403_t8Ntor5JQ,"Really, really nice people. Stayed open a little longer on Greek Easter to let us enjoy their cuisine. And they did that before they found out we came from Wisconsin. (The latter got us an ouzo on the house. Thanks Cory - you rock!!!!)

Food was authentic and absolutely outstanding. Lamb was fork tender and flavorful.  Snapper was perfectly grilled and seasoned.  Three dips and warm pita to start. 

Great wine list with many retsinas.  (Trust me, try one, with the food). 

The green bean and greens sides were both unbelievable. 

Our server, Cory, was so nice and helpful and made the whole experience a pleasure. 

Lucky you, Cleveland. Can't wait to come back with a group!!!!",1

Finally there is a viable option that brings authentic Greek cusine to Northeast Ohio, a classy establishment that serves a variety of seafood and classical Greek dishes.  If you like the flaming spectacle of Saganaki served tableside, you got it! If you'd prefer to end your meal with a nice shot of Ouzo, that is a welcome invitation here as well. Expect to pay between $20-30 per person, but if you like quality and generous portions, then you truly get what you pay for.",1
h0eR5-U7hWtkKeYbqJIqPA,"Legit Mexican food in University Circle. I'm so happy that they're here!

I'm a fan of their W 117th restaurant, and I will definitely support their business here. Luchita's Express is ""assembly line"" style like Qdoba or Chipotle, but this is a little more authentic. They serve burrito mojados w/ mole, which is one of my favorites. All of their burritos are under $6 (before tax), so it's a great deal too.

They use all organic & local OHIO products and the owners are great people. Let's keep them in business, and let's support the local business owners in University Circle!",1
h0Wmyzb8q0bXbrqmWqVvfQ,"Ordering a pickup doesn't do this place justice. The inside is clean and the tables are cool, plus if you take too long to get it home and start eating, it can get soggy in the container! I can't say any Chinese food is the ""best"" since I've had authentic 5 times in my life. But, this place has my favorite ""general tso's chicken"" anywhere around here. It's crunchy not soggy. And they ask you how hot/spicy you want it. I always say hot and its not overpowering. Everything is made fresh. They have big chunks of chicken breast in the crispy breading instead of mushy frozen crap. Also, Sezchuan Chicken is my second choice at this place! 10/10

This is not a buffet. But, they give you huge portions.",1

h0Wmyzb8q0bXbrqmWqVvfQ,"Veggie lo mien combo and shrimp with vegetables combo is a big portion and delicious.  The rice was different then similar restaurants near me, different taste and color, may be more authentic then most near me. It was a great lunch. Love it!",1
h0Wmyzb8q0bXbrqmWqVvfQ,"Stopped in for dinner one evening at Dragon Towers.

When checking out a new Chinese restaurant for the first time - I always order the same thing: Hot and Sour soup, fried spring rolls (with a side of authentic house Chinese mustard) and Kung Lao Chicken - extra spicy! I also had them replace the regular white rice with some fried rice.

The place was almost devoid of customers during the time I visited. The lady who took my order and brought my food out was nice and attentive.

The Hot and Sour soup and the rolls were pretty good overall. The house Chinse mustard was spot on. I got the desired nasal headrest that one gets from real Chinese mustard.

However, the Kung Pao Chicken should have been more accurately labeled - ""Kung Pao Celery and Bell Pepper"" - because the dish was absolutely overloaded with these two vegetables. Wayyyyyy to heavy on the celery and bell pepper.

I'd probably come back and try something else - but not the Kung Pao Chicken!

h0Wmyzb8q0bXbrqmWqVvfQ,"Chinese restaurants are sometimes tough to review, since there are the ""American"" Chinese restaurants, and the more authentic variety. 

I've been to Jackie Chen a number of times with my kids, but never really knew what to make of the place. That was until I went a little off the typical General Tso's chicken or Hunan Beef and went for one of their less-American dishes. 

I wouldn't say the dish was ""Authentic"" Chinese per se, but it was really, really good. It was a Lo Mein-like noodle dish served with crab meat, vegetables, and a very light sauce. I wish I could remember the name of the dish. In any case, the point is, if you get a little adventurous you might be pleasantly surprised. 

For the typical Americanized dishes, Jackie Chen is fine, but try their others, and you'll see why I put them up there amongst the best Chinese restaurants around.",1
h0Wmyzb8q0bXbrqmWqVvfQ,"Love it!  When I don't want take out, Dragon Towers it is.  I grew up in Asia Town, so finding good, authentic Chinese food can be a challenge on the Westside...enter Dragon Towers. 

This family owned, family run restaurant is top notch.  They recently remodeled so BONUS on the appeal.  The menu is a mix of traditional American Chinese dishes and authentic Chinese soups, hit pots dnd more.  

We started with egg drop soup and good old shrimp chimps. I ordered shrimp lomein and a veggie egg roll with way too much tea, and my husband had a tofu schezuen hot pot...spicy and delicious.   Great food, authentic old restaurant, check it out if you are in the Kamms area.",1
H1j34TgbrVZkxeww9xlJTw,"I honestly do not get it. 

The gyro: Good.  In fact, I'd say the meat is very good. Cooked very well, with crispy bits and juicy bits.  Slightly spicy, and delicious.  Good portions.
The lettuce was fresh, the tomatos not so much, and the sauce...eh.  Take it or leave it.  I prefer the more authentic yogurt based sauces.

The actual experience: Wow, when people said it'd be a wait, they weren't kidding.  In fact, I think the stall keeps people waiting on purpose.  There's only 2 people working in the stall, and only one girl making the gyros.  I don't quite know what the other one is doing, but she seems to be cleaning stuff...walking around...telling people it will be a wait.....

The girl making the gyros...slow, not very efficient, and will take cell phone calls should she get one, and your gyro will have to wait.

$8 for a regular and $10 for a jumbo (yep! prices go up when they get on TV!). 

All in all, good gyro, but definitely NOT with the 30min wait for 10 people in front of you and the germs from the girl's cell phone.",0
H1j34TgbrVZkxeww9xlJTw,"I'm in Cleveland for work and a coworker recommended Steve's Gyros. He also told me how they have been on numerous food channel shows. I found it in the market and there was a line. I thought to myself, ""I hope this is worth the wait.""  Well it was and it was the best gyro that I have ever had.  I'm from St. Louis and we have some authentic Greek restaurants, but there was something about their sauce that made it. Definitely give it a taste if you're in the area.",1

h39PkiW3Zt0N_syoRsKbGQ,Very authentic. Very fresh and worth the money you pay for. I ordered over the phone to go and they answer in Spanish. They speak English but it wouldn't be a bad idea to brush up on your Espanol. I had the tamale pollo w red sauce and beef taco with their homemade hot sauce. Hot sauce was excellente. I'll be back...this place will be one of my go to authentic Mexican eateries in this area.,1

I love some of the West side Mex hot spots, but this is cheap and non-Americanized awesome.  We were able to try some of the red and green ""hot"" sauces with Enchiladas Suizas and Chile     Relleno.  Both excellent and we will return very soon and often for this gem at Clark-Fulton.  If you enjoy authentic no-frills Mexican food, that is not slathered in sauces and cheese, this is your place.  They aren't hiding anything.  I can't wait to try the tamales!",1
h39PkiW3Zt0N_syoRsKbGQ,"I went here the other night based purely on the limited reviews below.  I was looking for a good taco tuesday place, and Las Dos Fronteras popped up on my map.  I was immediately intrigued by 1) P.W.'s review, which mentioned Le Carnicero and Momocho (YES, I have been to both and nothing against either place, but sometimes I'm just looking for some good, authentic mexican food . . .), and 2) the pictures of the menu, which list tacos for $1.85 each, and the tamales for $1.50.  Seriously?!  How can I not try a place that appears to have homestyle cooking for homestyle prices?  Obviously, everyday is taco tuesday here.

They started us off with a basket of chips, plus 3 different salsas.  My friend ordered 3 tacos, and had to take one home.  It was seriously a good amount of food.  I had the chicken enchilada suisas with the tomato sauce, which came with a generous portion of rice, lettuce, refried beans, and sour cream.  The enchiladas had just the right amount of sauce on top - not smothered, like some other places (cough, Villa Y Zapatas). I also had a couple chicken tamales, which are by FAR the best I've had in Cleveland.  The horchata was delish, and a flan came compliments of the chef. Overall, I'm very excited to go back and try everything on the menu . . . or just order an entire meal of tamales, which were heavenly. 

The decor was sparse, but very clean.  It's clearly a family owned/ family run restaurant, and they are open fairly late.  No real private event area, but there is a section that is kind of sectioned off where you could put a dinner party or a group of people.  It's only been open for a few weeks, so I'm not sure if they have their liquor license yet.  But when/ if they do, this place will be first on my list if Mexican restaurants to hang out at!",1
h39PkiW3Zt0N_syoRsKbGQ,This place is currently the BEST latin food in the Cleveland area. It reminds me a LOT of the small Mexican grocer/restaurant places that pop up and close. The only thing more authentic would be to visit someone mexican grandmother and eat tostadas in her kitchen because I'm pretty sure a mexican grandmother is running the grill at this place. Will definitely visit again. Let's keep this one open!,1
h39PkiW3Zt0N_syoRsKbGQ,"Went here Friday 9/6. 

This restaurant is the epitome of a mom & pop restaurant.  The restaurant aesthetically is not impressive, however the food is very authentic and the prices were right.

We stuck to the tacos which were great.  I would recommend the chicken tacos as the meat was very flavorful and moist.  In addition my wife enjoyed a chicken tamale with red sauce that she really enjoyed.

Note: This restaurant does not serve alcohol, however my guess is you could likely byob.",1
h39PkiW3Zt0N_syoRsKbGQ,My new stop for delicious fresh fast Mexican food.  Tacos were authentic and delicious!,1
h39PkiW3Zt0N_syoRsKbGQ,"Ehhhhh.... This place is okay. It's clean, the server was sweet, the food is decent. It's definitely better than Don Tequila or El Rodeo, but I love El SeÁE±or in Painesville for my authentic Mexican. 

We had chilaquiles (soggy), tamales (unmemorable), tacos (the pastor was tasty). The green sauce on the chilaquiles, red sauce on the tamales and the salsa for the table was all tasty. I'd go again if invited and be happy, but I won't make the Thierry minute drive to come back on my own.

The food is definitely quality, just not the best I've had.

.....oh, and the tv was way too loud. Sit far away from it!",0
h39PkiW3Zt0N_syoRsKbGQ,"I heard chef Eric Williams from Momocho opened up El Carnicero in Lakewood in the old McCarthy's building. I also heard it is $10-$15 for two tamales. I love Momocho (at Happy Hour) and am excited to try El Carnicero. I also heard of a new Mexican restaurant opening up one and a half miles down the road from Momocho on Fulton Road called Las Dos Fronteras. I was a lot more excited to try Las Dos Fronteras than El Carnicero because it looked to be authentic Mexican cuisine at a decent price.

The tamales here are $1.50 to generate a quick price comparison to the above mentioned restaurant. I think that is a good starting point. The menu has a lot of a la carte options and one may sample many different ""small plates"". They were out of the pollo tamale so I had the puerco with salsa verde and it was good. Since it is a taqueria, I tried a couple tacos. They are served with cilantro, onion, lettuce and tomato. I removed the lettuce and tomato and ate it with my beans and rice. The Al Pastor was fantastic and better than any taco at Barrio or Deagan's. You can come any day if you crave tacos; not just Taco Tuesday. I think La Plaza Supermarcado has slightly better tacos. The beans and rice were decent. One of my favorite parts of the meal was the order of guacamole for $3. It was a nice portion and a great deal for the price. The complimentary salsas were also fresh. The red salsa was very tasty and I preferred it to the verde. My buddy let me try his carne asada meal which was terrific as well. 

I urge the reader to try Las Dos Fronteras if you want some good Mexican food. The guy from Momocho has enough money and customers. Next time you go to Momocho and they tell you there will be a 30-45 minute wait, you should drive down Fulton and come here.",1
h39PkiW3Zt0N_syoRsKbGQ,"P.W. Said it all, I was the Carne Asada guy in his review,lol. It's good authentic Mexican, for affordable prices. It's as if you're actually in Mexico paying with pesos. Goya pops come in many flavors and they have many of them. Tacos are very good, too much cilantro can ruin a meal, these have just the right amount. 

The location is off in the cut, so you may pass it, but it's there, you can park in the empty lot across the street if there's no spots. 

There portions are not nearly as big as Rincon Criollo, or Quisque laBella's for that matter. The taste is there, but more bang for your buck at those places. Unless you want authentic Mexican specifically.",1
h39PkiW3Zt0N_syoRsKbGQ,"I've been here twice now and experienced super slow service before and after our food - so do not come if you are starving or have something planned soon after your meal - we waited forever just to get our waters, but once we placed out orders out food came very fast. It also took forever to get our check and then get our card back.  With that being said, the food is simply amazing!!  Everything I've ordered is fantastic!  I highly recommend the the street style tacos, chicken sope and the chicken tamale with the green sauce!  Flavorful and authentic :) just don't be super hungry when you get there or in a hurry ;)",1
h39PkiW3Zt0N_syoRsKbGQ,"Shame on you Yelpers! 4 stars? For....? If authentic means dry overcooked meat with no flavor and canned refried beans they nailed it. Our order - taco dinner beef pork tongue was ok, the pork tamale had taste but the pork was dry, they were out of tostadas so the waitress asked if I wanted the same as the bf was having and I agreed  except I did not get that. I got dry stringy flavorless chicken. The place is clean the staff very nice the entire meal was $20 but the items were disappointing. I ate here based on the 4 stars and reviews, some Yelpers need a tastebud rework or I somehow was served the worst Mexican food ever to leave their kitchen.",0
h39PkiW3Zt0N_syoRsKbGQ,"Que Pasa  Guerro.

This is a pretty authentic Mexican Restaurant with a good selection of Northern and Central Mexican Taqueria style comida.

Chips and salsa were good, nothing outstanding but none the less fresh and tasty.

The were out of red pazole when I arrived but did have green pazole.  For those of you who never had the pleasure of chowing down on pazole,  Mexican hominy  soup which is composed  of  big fluffy  a little bit chewy  Mexican(hominy) corn, a chile based chicken or pork based broth, shredded pork, cilantro, and other Mexican spices. This was pretty good. Only available on the weekends.

We had Panucho al pastor, a couple of tacos and the bistec which is a very thin steak.  Everything was very good except the bistec, it was kind of tough, but that is the way i remember it.

Service was very friendly and efficient.  A little slice of Mexico in Cleveland.",1
h39PkiW3Zt0N_syoRsKbGQ,"I am no stranger to down and dirty Mex because I love good, authentic grub.  Good thing me defiendo bien en espanol because our female server didn't understand a lick of English.  No frills interior.  I ordered the chicken and bean burrito.  For $5 it was the largest burrito I have seen in years.  I was totally bummed out by it.  Chicken was, thank god white meat, but no flavor whatsoever.  The beans were seasoned but in a burrito that large I had to seriously dig for them to get flavor.  Too much lettuce.  Booooooorring.  Zzz.   Chips are delicious.  Salsa was okay, nothing great.  And you WILL leave this place smelling like fried food.  Yikes, I wreaked.  As I say in all Mex reviews, I love Villa y Zapata for comparable down and dirty Mex.  Way, way better food and service.  

I suggest you don't park like an asshole like I did...But there are literally 4 parking spaces in front of the place.",0
h39PkiW3Zt0N_syoRsKbGQ,"The food was authentic, delicious, served reasonably quick and didn't roll off a food service truck! My picky pallatted coworker is 50% Mexican and agrees this place is worth a return trip or five.  I tried carnitas and  pollo  tamales that were served with a tasty mole sauce. I also ordered carne asada and pollo tacos. The shells were fresh, and the contents were properly portioned so you can eat with your hands!  The meal was completed with some delicious coffee laced with just the right amount of cinnamon. I would come here just to have a cup of coffee and I own a bakery with a really good coffee shop inside.  Quite possibly the best for last, at the persistent proddings of my Mexican friend, I also ordered the horchata!!!!  Wowee Kazowee!! This rice based beverage was like drinking rice pudding pop made from the best rice pudding on the planet! He was laughing at my reaction as  it is such an enjoyable drink!

 The ONLY reason the review isn't 5 stars is our waitress was in training and bobbled our order. (And quickly remedied the mistake). To the credit of several other Yelpers, expect a relaxed pace. Maybe even catch a siesta! Your service will not be Chipotle fast, but your food will be worth the wait!",1

They use real authentic Mexican ingredients in their food such as iceburg lettuce, cheese wiz & mozzarella cheese! Mmmmm! 

Wondering what kind of veggies are in the ""veggie burrito""? They are too! They change every day depending on what they have & when I asked what they had today he told me ""whatever is in the kitchen""- cool! That's specific & helpful in making food choices!

They also gave me a whole tomato in my nachos so I could cut it myself to my liking!

The staff is very friendly and service is okay. Plus, the decor is fun and feels authentic rather than cheesy, like other Americanized Mexican restaurants. 
My only complaints would be the wait we had to endure to pay our bill and the quality of the side dishes. It took several minutes for someone to meet us at the register, the rice was a little dry and some of the tortillas stiff and overcooked. 
I will definitely be returning here.",1
h39PkiW3Zt0N_syoRsKbGQ,"Taking the time to update my review because some asshole has been harassing me on yelp about this review- no doubt someone who works there cause who else would care about a review on this place from 2 years ago? He said i was ""hateful""-

HiJ2GEMZGKI8vwalAp2h-Q,"Best Chinese restaurant in Cleveland.  Ingredients are fresh and flavors are authentic.  Shredded pork in garlic sauce is everyone's favorite.  Fish fillet, dumpling, and lamb are all great.  Fried rice with sausage is so so though.  Sichuan food is oily and spicy, so be prepared.  

Service is average.  I asked the waitress for recommendation, and she was no help.",1
HiJ2GEMZGKI8vwalAp2h-Q,Very authentic food. We didn't get the hotpot. Ordered the regular meal. Sour and spicy cucumber. The spicy is really good. Hint of sourness. Pork with garlic sauce. Shredded meat cooked with hint of spicy and sweet. Fish Hot pot is pretty good. Nice pieces of fish fillet. They ran out of snow pea shots and substituted the green beans cooked in pickled cabbage. It's a keeper dish. Flavor like home cooked meal. Seats fills very quickly. The restaurant is decent size but the table turnover is not high as eating hot pot takes time. Definitely go early before table fills up.,1
HiJ2GEMZGKI8vwalAp2h-Q,"This is my third time here, this time with 6 friends... that's the way to go! You get to explore so much you would never think about trying otherwise. 

All were interesting, complex and beautiful to look at (nice presentation), but the stand outs were Chongqing Noodles, Shredded Pork with Pickled Cabbage Noodles and Ma Po Tofu. Someone at the table was so smart as to also order a wonderful cucumber and an additional eggplant dish to complement the protein choices. 

Some of the most authentic Sichuan cooking I've had in Cleveland. Staff and owner (?) were very nice and attentive. Looking forward to trying the Hot Pot soon. Super fast service, nice clean environment. BTW we were the only non-Asian table there that night ... which I take as an added plus.",1
HiJ2GEMZGKI8vwalAp2h-Q,"I've been looking for a long time for a Chinese restaurant to replace my ""kitchen away from home"" in Bethesda after the chef retired.  I finally find out! Unfortunately it is in Cleveland where I won't be able to visit again any time soon. But this place is amazing. 

 There are a lot of authentic Chinese food options on the menu, but as I normally do at a new Chinese restaurant. I stuck with the classics. I had the string beans, kung Po chicken, and pepper steak. They were all cooked and seasoned to perfection.  The chef has rare skill and judgement on the seasoning, and the service was amazing.  

If you like good Chinese food, you have to try this place. If I lived in Cleveland, I'd be here 3 out it 5 nights for dinner. Very good. Thank you!",1
hmfAdo6LuVOvBLiu75C8ZA,"Overlooking the flats district and the old stone bridgeãELuca's ambiance and traditional menu arrangements recall authentic Italian cuisine on Italian streets, complete with Italian pop playing over the restaurant sound system. 

Our group eschewed alcohol this evening, but the wine list was filled with bottles from Italy, and had some of my favorites, as well as a fair selection of North American and smattering of French wines as well. 

The sacchete with figs was exquisite and something I would recommend anyone. Great contrast between the fig's sweetness and the sauce. Wonderful flavor and delightful to the palate. 

I had tagliatelle bolognese and my friends had the ravioli with lobster and the third pasta we ordered eludes me. 

Overall, great experience, ambiance and cuisine.",1
hmfAdo6LuVOvBLiu75C8ZA,"Some of the best Italian food in Cleveland! Great place to go if you are celebrating a special occasion, or just looking for really good authentic Italian. The restaurant is more on the fancy side, and great for date nights. I went here the first time with my parents and boyfriend, and sat in one of the big booths towards the front by the bar. We had good views out the window, and our server was great. 

I had the pappardelle bolognese which was amazing! My parents tried the ossobuco, which was slow roasted to perfection. Our table also split a selection of desserts, but I was too stuffed to try them. The portions are very generous! I now know you can order half portions of pasta, although I did enjoy my leftovers. 

The second time I went I ordered the special of spaghetti and meatballs, and was disappointed. The sauce was bland and lacked flavor.. but my first meal was so delicious that I will give it another try!",1
hmfAdo6LuVOvBLiu75C8ZA,"Went to Luca for restaurant week. 3 course meal + glass of wine for $40. 

While driving through back alleys and winding roads, seemingly in the middle of nowhere, I questioned the decision to choose Luca over other restaurant week participants in downtown cleveland. Could good authentic italian really be served in this area? Walking into the restaurant, my concerns were quickly laid to rest driven by the warm, intimate interior. The restaurant is a beacon of light in an otherwise shady neighborhood. 

I ordered the salad, lobster ravioli and the tiramasu. The lobster ravioli was bomb. Big portions and generous amounts of lobster made this a terrific deal at restaurant week pricing. I am a pasta fiend and this dish had all the right components from the firm but melt in your mouth consistency of the ravioli to the rich, creamy tomato sauce. 

This is a hidden gem, which I am glad to have tried during restaurant week. Will definitely be back again!",1

hmfAdo6LuVOvBLiu75C8ZA,"My only concern about this restaurant is that we only learned of it when seeing it from above on the Veteran's memorial bridge and subway tour!  So glad we did check it out last weekend.  We've since learned it's been around for several years and they also have a Westlake location.  It's by far, one of the best restaurants I've been to in Cleveland, and maybe one of my top ten ever!  Being mostly Italian, and only living in Cleveland since 2015 (from NYC and raised in the Wash DC area), I've been on the hunt for an authentic Italian restaurant and this is definitely it!  I took one bite of the carciofi alla ragosta (fried artichoke hearts with lobster) and I had a flavor flashback from my childhood.   Plus, it mixes in a modern twist on the Italian classics (we had the Ahi carpaccio special and it was delicious with orange and arugula!).  We shared the Saltimbocca entree (simple, flavorful...just enough), because we over indulged on the perfect crusty bread!  Beautiful views, attentive wait staff (thanks, Rocky!), lovely ambiance, and a menu that is overwhelming (in the best way - that you have so many options).  Still dumbfounded that we never knew of it, but now, can't wait to go back!",1

Bring your $$$ because it ain't cheap and enjoy a fantastic night out.",1
hmfAdo6LuVOvBLiu75C8ZA,"I don't think I've been more disappointed. I had high expectations from the reviews and pictures. I question anyone who rated this place well. You can scroll down and find a woman who agrees with my assessment of the lobster risotto, and yet she still gave the place five stars? Which pretty accurately describes why I picked up the vibe of a bunch of 40+ somethings who felt important because they were paying a lot for their food and surrounded by men with sports coats.

-1 Nearly forced valet, lot not available for anyone not using valet. I figured it would be like that considering the price point, but some type of warning or sign would of been nice before entering the alley.

+1 Ordered two drinks at the bar and showed up early for my reservation. My Manhattan was perfect in the sense of it tasted how a classic Manhattan should. Sat immediately at my reservation time. Decor and presentation was nice. The lattuga salad was really good, mostly because the gorgonzola was crazy good. Others have talked about a gorgonzola dish, I could see why they would like it.

-1 I expectrf more authentic Italian but the entrees were very American, lots of protein, heavy and large portions. This isn't exactly a bad thing so let me explain the issue.

Traditionally it is my understanding that Italian dishes are more focused on small plates; typically ordering an appetizer, a vegetable ( typically a salad ), a pasta, and then secondi. This is exactly how Sotto in Cincinnati served their dishes which I found very authentic and delicious. It would be very difficult to eat la pasta and secondi which is why I found the menu very misleading and disappointing. 

-1 Like most overpriced restaurants, server was just trying to make sure is spent $$$ for a bigger tip instead of making sure I had a good experience. I explained that my date and I wanted to split a 4-course meal and share our plates. I saw the portions and they seemed large which is why I asked if this would be appropriate. Server assured me this was perfect. The appetizer and salad were very small, which was ok but didn't really match the entree sizes. 

One of the dishes I was interested in and wanted to split was the special of the day, Lobster Risotto. The price wasn't listed and so i should of asked.... It rang  out on my ticket as a single entree charge of $60. This seemed really high, even for this place considering a filet is $40. Pretty sure he just charged me for 2 risottos and gave me two risottos... but then just made it look like one because that's what I asked for. If you can't split the dish properly because the lobster is still on the tail... none of which was explained to me... then just be honest and say it isn't really a dish to be split. I'd be much happier then to be charged for 2 dishes when I think I'm getting 1.

I  ended up ordering too much food which was irritating because I specifically asked if this might be too much food and he assured me it was just right. Neither of us finished the risotto and we barely touched the secondi. Secondi was the orange duck.

-1 I thought the risotto was lack luster. I've had much better for 1/3 of the price. I always want risotto that is rich in flavor and creamy... I believe this is what makes risotto risotto, which this was neither. I expected the risotto cooked in a rich lobster broth and if it was I couldn't tell. Just a decent, borderline under-cooked rice, with a nice lobster tail on top.

-1 The duck was underwhelming. I wish the fruit notes were stronger, or there was more sauce. If duck is going to be the star and not the surrounding flavors, at least cook it right. Duck is considered to be a red meat! but was treated as a dark white meat, a safe dish that will hold moisture even if you cook the hell out of it.

Great place if you want to look and or feel like you have money. Also great if you want to feel apart of ""high-class"" society. Price not worth the food though, I would of had a better experience at a chain.",0
hmfAdo6LuVOvBLiu75C8ZA,"Great food, great service and a wonderful location. The seafood pasta was sooo delicious and it was a very good portion size. The lobster chunks were huge and I would have eaten it all if I wasn't so full. For an appetizer for the table we ordered the sacchetti al tartufo bianco and omg was it amazing, a must try! It's a white truffle and ricotta stuffed sacchetti and is topped with a cream sauce and aged fig balsamic. This place is a little pricey but great for a special occasion. 

The Lucente wine we tried was very good and a decent price at $65/bottle I believe. This place is a real treat and I definitely recommend checking it out if you enjoy authentic Italian cuisine. We sat on the covered patio which was very nice, I think there are awesome views of downtown if you sit inside. We came on a Friday night and it was packed, be sure to make a reservation!",1

HNs2Nf-trqFTDtho4vhfmA,My husband and I came first time for happy hour. Drinks were priced right for mediocre drinks. Ambience was nice especially if you sit outside.

hSU3MbB9Yu8MlybxfmABeg,"This place is delicious, authentic, and awesome for Italian food! I had a chocolate espresso martini to start off with and it was heavenly.

This place is also known for its pizza, but sadly I was too full to try any. Love the location in little Italy too!",1

Ambience:  Small, but adorable little place.  Luckily it wasn't crowded when we went in. 

Service:  There was one server running the place and he did a great job.  Didn't bother us too much and was there to refill drinks and ask if everything was okay.  

Food:  I ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo with Chicken.  It was the the best I've ever had.  The chicken was grilled to perfection and the sauce was creamy.  My boyfriend had the 12 oz. strip steak and he said it was very good!

Ordered the Carbonara. Real disappointment. Straight up bland heavy cream, watery, bland, not authentic whatsoever. I dont understand why restaurants can't make it with eggs..

I ordered something else.. but it was forgettable. 

The crowd seemed to be composed of well-dressed regulars, many of whom sat at the bar.
Idk.. I thought this was a very mediocre restaurant in terms of food.

hSU3MbB9Yu8MlybxfmABeg,"I don't make it out to little italy often but I have been to this gem twice now. Tucked away in little Italy, you will truly fine nothing less than authentic Italian cuisine here. 

The inside is tiny but cozy, not the most romantic atmosphere but still enjoyable because it's so small. The first time we came here the server had a little accident and spilled four sangrias all over our table and us. We laughed it off because it was his first week and assured him we would be back. When we came back last night, guess who was our server and who remembered us? The charming funny sangria spiller! He truly was awesome and I hope he waits on us again, despite the first mishap. After a few laughs we quickly ordered more sangria ( haha) and the best calamari in cleveland. 


Seriously this calamari kicks ass. It taste so fresh and is ever so lightly fried and sits atop a sauce a want to bathe in. Us four girls split the cavitelli and meatballs, chicken piccata and the shrimp scampi special. The meatballs were fabulous like they always are (we ordered double) but the shrimp scampi was the standout. The piccata was forgettable but still okay. We finished off our meal by splitting two cannolis (two come in an order) and it was the perfect sweet ending to the meal, do not miss these!


The only reasons I can't give five stars is because of the atmosphere and the price. I know that it's little Italy but for a round of sangria, calamari, three pasta dishes we easily dropped $150. Nonetheless, I know I won't be able to stay away.",1
hSU3MbB9Yu8MlybxfmABeg,"Stopped into Little Italy to have lunch on Sunday before heading back to Columbus. I had the chicken cacciatore, something I had never tried before. My sister and brother in law had eaten here before and assured me it was unlike anything I had eaten before. It was absolutely delicious! The chicken was perfectly cooked with a little char on the bottom. The mix of artichokes, portobello mushrooms and kalamata olives was perfect. Light but filling, came with a side of penne pasta in a tomato basil sauce. Wow. 
The bruschetta was on point - fresh and the bread it came on was chewy with crispy edges. They buy the bread from the bakery two doors down. 
The pizza, while looking simple, was a blockbuster hit! So simple yet so amazing. The meatballs on both the pizza and with the cavatelli were perfect. 
I'd recommend this place to anyone who's looking for authentic Italian done right. Sensational! Will definitely be back.",1
hSU3MbB9Yu8MlybxfmABeg,"Have you ever taken a bite of your food and literally wanted to melt as the taste sensations satisfied everything you were craving? 

Maxi's Ristorante serves up this feeling daily with every authentic and delicious Italian dish they prepare. It's times like these when I ponder how I'm not 380lbs of beastly-ness because, man...I can take down some serious pasta. This is especially true if it's from Maxi's. 

So, you're strolling around Little Italy and you can't figure out where to dine.  Well, I agree. It's truly difficult to pick one restaurant in that neighborhood because they're all great in their own right. BUT, there's just something about Maxi's that keeps me coming back.  It's the food. Specifically the pasta.

My first Maxi's dinner was incredible. There were six of us at a table and we all ordered something different, but all pasta dishes. Everyone shared and with each new bite, it became more difficult to pick a favorite. In the end, I couldn't choose. I know I had the Goat Cheese Ravioli and my sister choose the Penne Pasta Carbonnara. Both were divine. It's literally the most painful experience in the world to watch me try to pick ONE dish to order though. Since the first trip I've added a new favorite to my list, which is the stuffed banana peppers. If I could live off this dish, I would. I'm not kidding. 

There are only a couple of things that bring Maxi's down to a 4 star instead of a 5. The service is just so-so. I'm not the kind of person who likes to be waited on hand and foot, but there's a balance. Our servers always seem to be uninterested and eager to get off work. 

My other issue is the price. I mean, some dishes I can understand a heftier price tag, but pasta dishes $20 and over? Really? It's PASTA. Damn good pasta, but still...I'm not ordering a prime cut of steak here!  Besides, the atmosphere doesn't quite merit that cost either. So, it wouldn't really fall into my ""worth it because it's the whole vibe"" category. It better suits a normal night out for dinner, casual attire, etc. 

I still can't hate on Maxi's though. I mean, their food is just so ridiculously good that it's nearly impossible not to want to spend the money.  I mean, I can even forgive them for the service. All that's forgettable, but the food..well, that's the kind of pasta you dream about.",0
hSU3MbB9Yu8MlybxfmABeg,"Fantastic food! But that alone should get you a five star review... unless of course, something like customer service falls short. 
 Cute atmosphere and my boyfriend and I did not feel over dressed in jeans and hoodies. They were playing beautiful Italian music over head and we chose to sit at the bar. The service was ""ehhh"", took them awhile to give us attention after handing us waters and menus. But the food was to die for, would have had another glass of wine if it hadn't been 10 dollars a glass for an unimpressive pour. 
All around might go back for the food, but for the price one of the fancier authentic Italian places in the area is likely worth it for the nicer customer service.",1

The restaurant is small and cozy, with nice music and atmosphere. Our waiter was friendly. For the price we paid, the pizza was just average in my opinion.

The food was authentic, fresh and flavourful!  The value was excellent. We enjoyed the company of the owners, who sat at the bar next to us and were very hospitable and friendly. The only downside was the drab decor. The lights were bright and the music was barely audible. There were no textures or colors. Very UN-Turkish! That's why I did not give 5 stars.",1

Went with a friend who raves about this place ... it was a little unnerving that we were the ONLY people in the place at 7 PM on a Saturday evening with every other joint in Ohio CIty filling up with beer lovers and food fans, but by the end of our meal all I could think was ""Their loss!"" for everyone who walked by.

Alaturka's ezme starter, served with warm pita was just phenomenal - spicy and rich - with the slight crunch of walnuts adding a great texture. It was just spicy hot enough to wake up my taste buds, but warm enough to keep them primed for the main course.

I went with the filet mignon kabobs, while my husband had the lamb and our friend was in heaven with his stuffed eggplant. The meats were well marinated with lots of meat flavor wonderfully enhanced with their Mediterranean spices. The meat also had those wonderful crispy edges that were just blissful. I prefer medium rare beef, and, while these were served medium, the meat remained soft, easy to cut and delicious. The rice and cabbage sides were fine accompaniments. 

The baklava was a tasty finish, but the real star is the authentic food with wonderful flavors and textures. I can see this becoming our go-to place for a quick, delicious meal with no wait - a least until Alaturka gets itself on the radar for everyone heading to Ohio City for great food.",1
hTSIT3puu8m8-kOZYS4Zdg,"Reading these reviews is hilarious. Don't people realize that salt = flavor?

Anyway, I go there a decent amount, but mainly for sustenance. Those who think this is somehow better than Chipotle are insane. At best, they're roughly the same. The meats are better at Chipotle, but OCB take better care in preparing your burrito and gives you free guac. Oh, and neither is authentic. But that's not really the point.

I do like that they have horchata (but it's way too sweet) and Mexican coke, though.",0
hTSIT3puu8m8-kOZYS4Zdg,"Chipotle who? In all honesty, I was expecting OCB to be very similar to the chain, and in some ways it is. The food options are the same-rice, beans, meats, salsas, etc. You can get a burrito, bowl, or salad, just like chipotle. 
But the biggest differences I noticed were the flavor and portions, and that's why I'll put OCB ahead of chipotle any day. I got a carnitas taco salad and they loaded on everything. SO much pork and black beans. And guac is included!!! This was the best part for me. I took a nibble of the bf's barbacoa burrito, and that was also exceptional. 
Everything tasted more authentic and home cooked, which I really like. I'm a sucker for a family owned restaurant. The decorations and the music are also a really authentic touch. 
This was my first time here, but it definitely won't be my last. Another great thing about Ohio City!",1
hTSIT3puu8m8-kOZYS4Zdg,"I wanted to like OCB so bad! First time having it, and probably the last time going. 

PROS- Food seemed authentic
            Bang for your buck

CONS- Everything about the place seemed dirty, tables, prep kitchen, service etc
            Thought the food lacked flavor and spice 

With so many great spots in OC, it'll be easy to pass this spot up.",0
hTSIT3puu8m8-kOZYS4Zdg,"Really enjoyed this cute little place! The service was amazing for being in a city, and the authentic feel knocked chipotle out of the park! The food was especially yummy and fresh. Great price too!!",1
hTSIT3puu8m8-kOZYS4Zdg,"There timings are wrong they are open til 9 fridays and saturdays. The food is good basically a more authentic chipotle. I do wish they gave a little more guac and sour cream than the 1 teaspoon they currently give. The food is good the pico didn't look fresh, tasted fine.",0
hTSIT3puu8m8-kOZYS4Zdg,"Reminds me of a local version of a certain big burrito chain, but with better carnitas with more flavor. And the hot salsa actually has some heat.

Cute interior and exterior, the main killer is that while they're not a bad burrito, they're not particularly authentic or particularly stand-out enough to blow me away. The experience seems to be more like that big chain burrito place than anything else.

Which leaves them kind of in the middle of a no-man's land, a solid improvement over the brand name alternatives, but that's such a low bar to start with that I have a hard time awarding that 4th star.",1
hTSIT3puu8m8-kOZYS4Zdg,"Any time you're in Ohio City, you must try OCB! Great little shop that offers good authentic Mexican food. I personally love the Brother's Burrito, but I'm sure anything from there is delicious! Hate to use Chipotle as a comparison, and I'll admit I am a huge Chipotle fan, but whenever I'm in Ohio City I will always stop at Ohio City Burrito for a good burrito! One thing I do appreciate for sure is that you don't have to pay extra for things like guac! The store has a decent amount of seating, but during peak hours it does get pretty busy in there!",1
hTSIT3puu8m8-kOZYS4Zdg,"For the longest I had seen Ohio City Burrito driving up and down W 25. Finally decided to stop in today. I was pleasantly surprised that the tastes and menu selection were a little more authentic than I thought they would be. 

I ordered a chicken Brother's Burrito with black and retried beans which I watched them meticulously piece together. I liked the fact that guacamole was free. I also got tomatoe and corn salsa. Which brings me to my only complaint.

The chicken and salsa was not nearly spicy or seasoned enough. I go to burrito spots expecting the majority or basic ingredients to have some sort of heat. 

Other than this I was okay with my spur of the moment cuisine choice. Evrrything tasted pretty good and the ingredients had at least average freshness. Although I won't be in a rush to return anytime soon, at some point I will most likely be back.",1
hTSIT3puu8m8-kOZYS4Zdg,"Being from California and experience true Mexican food; I can say this was not.  They do not offer carne asada, so I asked for chicken.  The chicken was pulled, but was mixed with a majority of bean paste and little chicken and what appeared to be taco packet seasoning.  I was then asked if I would want ice berg lettuce and cheese on my tacos.  Since traditional Mexican food does not have lettuce, cheese, sour cream, etc, I said no, and asked for onion and cilantro.  Instead I got a pile of chopped tomatoes with little to no onions nor cilantro; which was overwhelmed by the tomatoes.  It's sad really, because Mexican tacos are not complicated.  I've had better tacos from roach coaches in California.  Am I doomed to not find an authentic Mexican restaurant in Cleveland?  It appears people from the region who recommend this, do not know Mexican food.",0
hTSIT3puu8m8-kOZYS4Zdg,"Tried this joint for lunch and it was yummy! The staff was very helpful for us first-time diners and there was something for everyone in our group. I opted for the regular tacos with chips and salsa. I don't really eat spicy food and did find their proteins to all have a bit too much spice for me but not to the point that I didn't enjoy my meal. 

The pros:
*Awesome ambiance
*Fantastic customer service - super friendly and eager to explain the menu
*Food tasted authentic and delicious

The cons:
*Seemed a bit expensive, in my opinion
*Very small restaurant and we had kids in our group which was difficult to navigate in such a tight space

Bottom line: I wouldn't choose this place first for mexican but would definitely visit again if I was in the area.",1
hTSIT3puu8m8-kOZYS4Zdg,"I'd say OCB is a step down from Chipotle and I am not a fan of Chipotle.  I will take an authentic Mexican burrito join any day.  I actually thought the taste was a bit bland and lacked character.  I could re-create that exact same burrito taste in my kitchen.  Small menu but if it's a burrito you're seeking, you'll find it.  I love the baby burrito--a 6"" flour tortilla with beans, cheese and salsa for $1.85.  It's probably the best value on the menu.  Their blue and red corn tortilla chips are good, and I am a fan of the Red salsa which is a hot salsa.",1
hTSIT3puu8m8-kOZYS4Zdg,"This little Ohio City establishment in a gem!! The quality of the food is amazing and everything tastes authentic and delicious!!  I normally get the Brother's Burrito (classic with guac, sour cream, chicken, rice and pico and corn salsa) and you can't lose ordering that.  

But today I tried the 25th St. Tacos :D They are soft taco shells with refried beans spread on them wrapped around a crunchy shell and then filled with choice of meat and salsas, what have you.  These were amazing!! I got one with chicken, which I knew going in the chicken was good, but i got another one with the carnitas, and I think I liked the carnita taco better! I thnk the chicken is spiced up more than the pork carnitas, so I liked having the less spiced meat on the tacos.  They were kinda messy but worth it.  I got sour cream on the side so I could add it to each bite.

This place is totally worth the trip!! Especially if you are down by the market picking up produce or what have you and you want to stop for lunch somewhere beside a place in the market, this would be a great choice!",1
hTSIT3puu8m8-kOZYS4Zdg,"I'm gonna give this place 5 stars I was Impressed with the authentic taste of the ingredients. I regret not eating here a long time ago but better late then never. I had a chicken Burrito with all the fixens , and I had Hachata drink to rinse this lovely Burrito down . I've heard mixed reviews people complaining they don't give you enough Guacamole but it's free your charged for it elsewhere I'm quite sure you can pay more to get extra . The taste they have several options choose to your liking they have several different bottles of sauces you can choose to squirt on your food . The decor is awesome felt like I was in another state awesome inside. Price is actually cheaper then the chain restaurants . Love it! I will be back",1
hTSIT3puu8m8-kOZYS4Zdg,Ohio City Burrito... Hmmm. I think some of the reviews are a tad bit harsh. It is very similar to that franchise place that sells humongous burritos that shall remain nameless *cough* chipotle. I do think the ingredients are fresh and comparable. Price is comparable as well. I do like that you can get refried beans here. Also they don't charge you extra for guacamole like they do at that other place... granted they aren't quite as generous with it either. Overall a solid burrito. My beef is with the chips.  For a restaurant that markets itself as authentic their chips are store bought and packaged into snack sized packs. They really need to step up their chip game!!,1
hTSIT3puu8m8-kOZYS4Zdg,"This place is a hidden hem I meant JeM, honestly 10 times better than chipotle without a doubt this is cheeped to and more authentic",1
hWLqwafZ2tXH0S073lJSGA,"It's hard to not be jealous of these guys, introducing Detroit style Coney Island hot dogs to Cleveland.  As  I hail from the ""D"", I was really looking forward to seeing if they actually got it right.

They did....really truly did.

Except for the lack of a loud Greek guy yelling from the line, the food at the The Coney Company is true to form.  They use a local (Detroit) chili company, and have the authentic natural casing hot dogs.  They offer all the favorites like a ""loose coney""  and ""coney taco"".  The dogs were cooked perfectly, toppings perfect, and the buns sealed the deal.  

This is a family run joint, and they were there, with great service.  It's clean, easy to find, and very affordable. 

Support local business and keep Detroit chili in the CLE!!",1
hWLqwafZ2tXH0S073lJSGA,"I was pleasantly surprised that these are authentic Detroit style coney dogs!  They have many different styles dogs as well.  Staff was very nice too.  They do have this place set up like a fast food restaurant which is a bit different then I was expecting.  They also serve fresh cut fries which is a little different from a traditional Detroit restaurant, but they tasted great and they give you a ton of them.  Very happy to have a place in Cleveland to fill my coney craving.  I will be back!",1
I1fMePTxyUOp78kPCsLVNw,"Can someone make me rich?  I promise I deserve it.  Then I could buy a beautiful reusable grocery bag that I strap around my shoulders as I saunter into this chic little grocery store and stock up on all the organic supplies my eyes feast upon.  It's a SUPER CUTE store.  I feel fancy just being in there.  For me, it's not a legitimate practical shopping place for my groceries, but then again, I'm not that fancy.  Let's be frank, I'm an ALDI girl.

The thing is though, I live right around the corner and I love the opportunity to have a delicious latte, and perhaps, pick up a really nice organic cheese and interesting vegetable to create an authentic snack.  This is the type of place I'd come in the early afternoon on a day where the world isn't rushing me, and honestly, it just makes you FEEL good.  I can't describe that any other way.  It makes me think I'm in the heart of NYC, living in a Brownstone, and I need to run out and grab a quick tomato for a homemade sauce my husband and I are trying to make.

I'm not sure how weird I'm turning this review, and I'll spare you the rest of my awkward lifetime fantasies... but this place is neat.  It has a super local vibe, very adorable ambiance, and the necessities when you're in a pinch!  I didn't try the food but the fresh ingredients are displayed right in front of you so you can watch the magic unfold.

ONE THING I FEEL CONFIDENT IN:  Get the maple latte.  You can max and relax on the comfy furniture provided and stare out the huge windows at the entertaining passersby of Detroit.  (The plural of passerby is a tricky one - even Google's a little confused)  

Come check out this unique location!",1
I2lDmQHDxnUKbEBJuJCW6w,"Had to go to the Richmond mall yesterday and was in the mood for Chinese, so checked out Hunan East after being intrigued by other Yelp reviews.

  Maybe my palate doesn't appreciate so-called 'authentic' Chinese, because this stuff was weak.  Ordered a fairly straight forward dish found in every joint like this, which others consider to be an American-ized dish, Kung Pao chicken, but substituted tofu for chicken.  Absolutely no heat to it at all, and sorely lacking in flavor.  I've never used the soy sauce packets you're given at Chinese restaurants, but had to for the first time here just to get through the bland sauce.  More expensive than similar Chinese places convinced me I don't think I'll ever be ordering from here again.",0
I2lDmQHDxnUKbEBJuJCW6w,"This was my absolute FAVORITE neighborhood hole-in-the-wall when I lived in Cleveland. It's unassuming and almost unnoticeable -- it's in a strip mall, for goodness' sake! -- except for the large red and yellow sign above the door. 

Mike, the buff owner, always comes by to talk and make you feel welcome. He's a pro at suggesting what to eat, and often it's not even on the menu. There's the typical Americanized Chinese menu with the staples (sweet and sour chicken, general tso's chicken, beef and broccoli, etc.), then there's the Chinese menu. It looks more extensive and is entirely in Chinese, so I have no clue what it actually says. Even so, I repeatedly received that menu (while my compatriots received regular menus) whenever I dined in, and I'd actually feel embarrassed to tell them that I'm not Chinese, nor can I read it, so I'd need a different menu. But I'd redeem my cool points because I'd ask for the picture menu. That's right: there's also a picture menu you can request that features delectable pictures of dishes not on the regular menu. I recommend asking for this when you eat there. Not only does it make you look seasoned, but looking at it will make your mouth water. 

Another trick a lot of the regulars use is the old standby of looking at a neighboring table's dishes, then pointing and telling Mike or your server that you want what they're eating. I discovered the fish in black bean sauce this way, and it became a regular request ever after. 

The place is always packed, and it's always packed with Asian people, so you know it's authentic. The waitstaff is fantastic, and they all remember you if you dine there a few times. Water glasses never seem to dip below full, as they're constantly topping you off. Constantly. 

Pretty much anything off the picture menu is fabulous. I'm a bit so-so on the American menu, but I generally don't care much for the diluted food, if you know what I mean. Order the ho fun shrimp -- and order it spicy -- if you're looking for savory goodness. (It's not on the menu, but again, they customize just for you.) They don't scrimp on the shrimp, as I consistently got more than a dozen very large suckers every time I ordered it. By far, this was my favorite dish.

There are few things I miss about Cleveland, but this is damn sure one of them!",1
I2lDmQHDxnUKbEBJuJCW6w,"I went here for the first time today, at the suggestion of a couple friends.  I'm having a hard time rating it, but it will require another visit to make up my mind.  

Decor:  Evidently, this place was inherited by the current proprietors as the decor suggests a seafood joint of distinctly un-Asian origin.  My guess is that the art on the walls and the sculptures of fish were present long before soy sauce was ever splashed within these walls.

Food:  Given the name, I was expecting Hunanese food... so I went through the chinese only menu to get an idea of what was available.  There was a smattering of dishes that were ""general""b the majority did suggest an origin in the vicinity of Hunan.  Problem:  I love some Hunanese dishes, especially the ones I got to enjoy in Hubei, but I've never eaten an extensive amount of Hunanese dishes in a proper Hunan fashion.

I ordered two of my standard test dishes to try to get an idea what the Chef's background was.  I ordered a Mapo Tofu and Jajiangmian.  

The Jajiangmian was okay.  Unlike Beijing and S. Korean variations, this wasn't in the black, charred onion based sauce that dominates in S. Korean joints.   Their version had carrots, celery, dried tofu, garlic, spring onions and pork strips.  The effect was okay, but not (in my mind) traditional northern Chinese.  The noodles they used are yimian noodles.

The Mapo Tofu that they made was much closer to the mark than that I had at Siam cafe.  The Tofu itself was fresh, though a little more rigid than I prefer.  I prefer the type that essentially disintegrates on contact with anything more forceful than blown vapor.  The sauce was appropriately red.  Their version is vegetarian, with no pork.  The garlic was cut in larger chunks (I prefer finely diced, with nearly ground pork),   Spring onions were also mixed in for colour variation.  Flavour was close -- except a key missing aspect:  almost no detectable peppercorn.  I like to tingle with the numbing, anesthetic effect.

So... neither was great -- but neither were bad, if I just forgot that I've had other versions of those dishes.

Thus, I had to ask:  Where were the proprietor and cook from?  Well, they have a Cantonese manager and a Shanghainese chef.  When next I visit, I'm going to ask for more Shanghainese dishes and see how that turns out.  

My general sense is that the food is authentic homestyle southern chinese -- though not Cantonese south, like... Shanghai south.  

So... next attempt will be to try the beef tendon, and check out some of the cook's specialties.",0
I2lDmQHDxnUKbEBJuJCW6w,I don't like the taste there. The food are too oily feel like a bit Americanized but my other two Chinese friends think it is a very authentic Chinese restaurant.,0
I2lDmQHDxnUKbEBJuJCW6w,"It's as good as it gets on authentic Chinese food outside downtown Chinatown area. The flavor and taste is very Cantonese style.  Problem is very crowded if you go late. Worth the wait.

I like the picture album of the menu which makes selection a lot easier. The flavor of the food is excellent for me. For those who says it's bland, maybe need to de-salt your taste bud. American culture is addicted to salt and sugar.",1
I2lDmQHDxnUKbEBJuJCW6w,"Delicious food and outstanding, friendly customer service.  The best way to judge the quality of the food in a Chinese restaurant is to see how many other Asians are there.  When I was there it was 3/4 Asian customers - that tells you how authentic the dishes are!  The ""secret""  menu is completely in Chinese (no pictures!) so you are unfortunately out of luck if you aren't with someone that can read Chinese, which we were and here hence fortunate to experience some out-of-the-ordinary Chinese cuisine.  Food was fresh and the flavors were outstanding.  On a Tuesday evening, it was packed, and am told that it is pretty hard to get a seat on the weekends.  That tells you something, too!   And as others have said, portions are very generous and the value is good.  We had 5 in our party, ordered 5 dishes, noodles, and soup for under $90 and came home with almost another meal's worth of food!",1
I2lDmQHDxnUKbEBJuJCW6w,"We have been eating in and taking out Hunan East's food for two decades.  It is the absolute best Chinese food on the east side---and you can have your pedestrian Cantonese or, wonderful authentic Hunan dishes from the regular or Special menus.  I will admit that the egg rolls are not impressive.  But the Hot and Sour soup certainly is.  The Beef Satay appetizer is delicious, as are the potstickers--I love mine steamed with hot oil on the side.  Ordering can be a challenge because so many choices of very good food.  For example, our favorite dishes are:  Veggie Egg Foo Young.  I can guarantee the you have never seen this dish prepared better than this and it tastes super.  Two HUGE servings, about the size of a softball each--not the sorry flat pancakes served elsewhere.  Hunan Beef.  Can be ordered at any amount of heat--I like mine medium, using the perfect white rice as a contrast.  Lettuce Wrappers off the Special Menu.  An amazing combination of chopped chicken and Chinese vegetables with a delicious tangy sauce, served on and along side of huge lettuce leafs for wrapping.  Ho Fun Chicken.  Wide noodles, all kinds of veggies, chicken and wonderful sauce.  Finally---ALL the fresh shrimp dishes are fresh and wonderful.

The owners are on premise and speak perfect English as a second language.  The servers are monitored and taught to do things correctly--sometimes there is a language barrier but the owners often intercede.  

It's really nice to have a high quality Chinese restaurant as fine as this nearby.  Enjoy!",1
I2lDmQHDxnUKbEBJuJCW6w,"When it comes to Chinese places around the Heights area, the choices are plenty, and trust me I've tried them all.  Hunan East has the most authenticity out of all of them.  Take a look at their picture menu and be brave, otherwise stick to the usual suspects and enjoy.  My staples that you would thing all Chinese places would get right are Egg Drop, Hot & Sour Soup, Crab Rangoons, and  something standard like a Hunan Beef or Hot Pot.  This joint has never let me down.  One item that gets over looked but is a must try, Pork Lo-Mein, try it, its awesome!!  Who really cares if there are fish on the wall??  The service is great, food comes out hot and fast, and it seems to be the place to go for the local Asian community.",1

I2lDmQHDxnUKbEBJuJCW6w,This place doesn't look like authentic from outside but they do have a lot of authentic and delicious Chinese food here. Service is good. They have a couple large round tables so it's very nice to have a group of people and try a lot of different dishes together. We always come here for lunch.,1
I2lDmQHDxnUKbEBJuJCW6w,"I just called over the phone to ask for a traditional chinese dish (pan fried beef rice noodles). I also ordered green beans. This was a pick up. When we got there, it wasn't even ready, they did not make it! They said they didn't have the noodles and was going to tell us when we got there (???) They told my husband if we wanted something else as my husband was going to order something else, they said they would make our dish (??). We got RICE vermicilli and not the flat noodles. Every chinese person knows the dish that we want. 

I like this restaurant because they can make chinese food that is authentic but they are def not consistent with their service and unfortunately, there isn't much of a choice around here (we normally go to Wonton Gourmet). 

Very disappointed!!",0
I2lDmQHDxnUKbEBJuJCW6w,"I have been back here almost weekly since writing my last review. This will blow any place on the east side out of the water unless you like your Chinese food from a can. 

Side note: 

The authentic stuff is mostly Cantonese. I do not know anywhere with in 5 hour drive that you can find a robust Hunan or Schezwan menu. 

Just about anything from the Chinese picture menu is good. Had something called Pork Jaja Mein. Or something like that. It was on of the to 10 best things I have eaten. It was a huge bowl of Chinese lomein noodles smothered in a spicy, garlicky, gingery, sauce with pork, onions tofu, veggies and diced Chinese shrooms. Absolutely amazing. 

I was stuffed after about eating 1/3 of it. 

This is super munchie food. 

Other outstanding dishes: 

The shrimp or seafood in black bean sauce is to die for. 
Chicken or Beef with Chinese mushrooms. 
Beef and sour vegetables. 
Chicken in garlic sauce. 
Kung Bo Chicken 
Look at what others are eating and that is how I have discovered some really good finds. Or just ask me. 


Of the American Menu the chef's specialties are very good. 

The General's Chicken is very good, you can tell it's white meat chicken breast. 
Triple Delight 

As far as food goes this is some of the best Asian food east side. The ambiance, not so much. 

There is no liquor so drink before if you feel the urge. 

The prices are super reasonable.",1
I2lDmQHDxnUKbEBJuJCW6w,"Giving five stars for the all around experience: exceptional food, staff and service. Two menus to peruse, an authentic Chinese menu or the easy American style, point at pictures type.

Used to never be a fan of hot and sour soup until I tried it here. It's a steal for only $1.50 a bowl! Generous portions of bamboo shoot, tofu and pork make this soup chunky. It's also the generous portion of vinegar that makes my lower mouth start to salivate and keeps me coming back.

For the low carb community, would recommend the mu shu, but specify without noodles. Nice blend of vegetables and meats, enormous portion, comes with a fried egg on top.

Love the owner Mike who has always treated us like family, will sit down and talk with us and never shoo us away.

Parking lot right outside. Also, side tip, ask the chef to use less oil.",1
I2lDmQHDxnUKbEBJuJCW6w,"Don't judge a book by its cover because the pages in this book is awesome. If you are looking for authentic Chinese food go no farther.. u have found the place.
I will say this is a perfect place for a group of people then you can try more dishes. first and foremost order from the picture menu!! The potion sizes are huge can easily serve a family of 4. The food is flavorful. I have nothing but great things to say. The service is good nothing to complain about there. I can't wait to go back.",1
I2lDmQHDxnUKbEBJuJCW6w,"I have been eating here for decades, starting back when there was not even a picture book for the truly authentic Chinese part of the two menus. I can not comment about the quality of the Americanized ""regular"" menu, but the ""Chinese style"" picture book items are fabulous! I have eaten almost every dish from that menu and you pretty much can't go wrong, but my favorites include Mongolian duck, shrimp and scallops in black bean sauce, beef with sour vegetables and mu shu chicken. Not only are the portions huge (you probably will have enough leftovers for a second meal at home), but the prices are more than reasonable. 
Do not expect to linger for long, as the place can be very busy. The service is exceptionally quick and they bring the check fast too, so this is not a place to have after dinner conversations or the like.  There is almost no selection of deserts either. 
The decor is your standard Chinese restaurant, nothing better or worse. The owners and staff are very nice, but some speak English better than others. Mike, the owner, is great and may chat with you, if he has the time.
I love Asian food and have eaten at hundreds of Asian restaurants both in Cleveland and around the country and even abroad. I feel very lucky to have Hunan East fifteen minutes from my home, which is why I have chosen to eat there almost weekly for over twenty years. The food is both different and delicious and you certainly won't go away hungry.",1
I2lDmQHDxnUKbEBJuJCW6w,Excellent shredded pork with garlic sauce...but must order the Chinese version. It has by far the most authentic Chinese food in East Cleveland. The restaurant is very clean but quite small. Service is good. Definitely will be coming back again and again.,1
I2lDmQHDxnUKbEBJuJCW6w,"This is the best and most authentic Chinese food on the east side!  We skipped the $6.95 lunch special (which includes tea, rice and egg rolls) and ordered from the regular menu (but got complimentary tea and rice anyway but declined the egg rolls).  Portions are enormous, so plan to share or take extras home. The hot and sour soup was tasty and tangy, a far cry from the gelatinous corn starch concoctions usually seen in Americanized Chinese restaurants.  We had mushu chicken, a Chinese comfort food of sorts, which came with plum sauce and wrappers, as well as an enormous platter of tasty filling with a scrambled egg cap to be mixed in. (Note, I was offered the ""English menu or Chinese menu"" version and naturally chose the Chinese one, which apparently contains more exotic ingredients than the other version, including bamboo shoots (not just the canned rectangular ones) and black woodear fungus.). We also had the shrimp, scallop, and squid in black bean sauce.  All the seafood was breaded and fried, then mixed with the sauce, but the scallops and shrimp in particular were generous in size and perfectly cooked. Service is prompt and friendly without being pushy. The seating area is much cleaner and more welcoming than many other downtown Asian restaurants.

We normally go to the Chinatown area for Chinese food, but every time I come here, I wonder why we don't go more often. I'll have to remedy that! Agree with others to ask for the picture menu.",1
I2lDmQHDxnUKbEBJuJCW6w,"I love this place. Tried the chicken lo mein here for the first time today and I love it!
I do find their wonton soup to be a little meh on some days usually daytime, but better in the evenings when all the dishes get it.
I am usually very happy when I eat here.
I love their little spring rolls, I could eat a dozen at one sitting.
Their portions are huge, the waitstaff is authentic.  You can go in there alone or with a large group.
I have had more good dishes there then bad ones, the only meal I would not suggest  is the Peking Duck, it was not what I am used too, too dry.",1
I2lDmQHDxnUKbEBJuJCW6w,"I wanted to like this place. My friend, a native Clevelander, I was visiting during Thanksgiving break recommended for us to eat lunch here because it's historically one of the first Chinese restaurants in Cleveland. I've been to plenty hole-in-the-wall authentic Chinese restaurants before and Hunan East just didn't taste right for me. The filling in their spring roll was too greasy, the fried rice had no flavor, and the breading of my usualâE Chinese dish, sweet and sour shrimp, completely overpowered the taste of both the sweet and sour sauce and the shrimp.

We love the sour vegetables with beef or chicken, pork with tofu, scallops in black bean sauce, Chinese style moo shu pork, pocket tofu, etc. Avoid the egg rolls. However, their egg foo young on the regular menu is excellent. We have been coming here for many years and food is always spot on.",1
I2lDmQHDxnUKbEBJuJCW6w,This a neighborhood jewel! Food is delicious and plentful. Hot and sour soup is always perfectly hot and sour. Ask for the Chinese menu for the most authentic preparations...and there's pictures!.,1
I2lDmQHDxnUKbEBJuJCW6w,Best authentic Chinese food you'll find here besides the dim sum places around Asia Plaza.,1
I2lDmQHDxnUKbEBJuJCW6w,Their Chinese menu is extensive.  The ingredients are fresh and good quality.   Dishes are less oily and less salty than typical Chinese restaurants.  Pretty authentic flavor compared to other Chinese restaurants in this area.  Service is very friendly and attentive.,1
I2lDmQHDxnUKbEBJuJCW6w,"For a Chinese this is one of places I can find authentic Chinese food, more are the east region of China (Shanghai etc) instead of Cantonese style food you see the most. The price is reasonable and the portion is A LOT! If you dare to eat pig feet/organs (all authentic Chinese food) you can find them here! :) they have two types of menus: one is for authentic Chinese food(in Chinese); one is for Americanized Chinese food( in English). They also have a photo menu which maybe good for people wanna order authentic Chinese food without knowing Chinese.",1

They have an excellent Lobster seafood pot and it's one of the only places I can get pan fried noodles. Their black bean shrimp is as good as it gets and the Mongolian beef is as tender as a virgin Buddhist monks ass. 

I can not finish this review without mentioning the only place I have eaten snow pea stems and baby bock chow in a light oil that removes the guilt from all the calories you have just eaten.",1

I2lDmQHDxnUKbEBJuJCW6w,"Order off the picture menu for some of the most authentic Chinese food outside of Chinatown! 

On my most recent experience, I ordered both the eggplant with garlic sauce and lamb stew with Chinese vegetables. Both were delicious! If you've ordered this eggplant dish before, the kind at Hunan East might taste a bit different- it's served hot and sour style with chilis, but is not hot enough to keep your mouth ablaze. I'd rate it a medium on the heat scale. And the lamb... OMG that lamb was incredible! It's a hotpot stew with tender, falling off the bone meat, green onions and bok choy. Very flavorful, yet not spicy at all (think below mild, even). You can even suck the marrow out of the bones, if that's your thing, which put a smile on my face. 

The other diners I ate with ordered food from the regular American-style Chinese menu and reported that their dishes were above average (beef with broccoli and orange chicken), so less adventurous eaters will still be pleased with their old standbys.",1
I2lDmQHDxnUKbEBJuJCW6w,"I'm giving this restaurant a 5 because although it is not the best chinese restaurant I've ever had (granted I grew up in Taiwan), it is the best chinese restaurant in Cleveland. And for that, I give it a 5 for being top-notch in Cleveland.

Don't come into this restaurant expecting the best Chinese restaurant in the world, but if you've only tried food in Cleveland, then this is the place to go.

Overall, I do really enjoy their food. When I go, they hand me the Chinese menu which has alot more food choices including some reallyy authentic ones. The food here is as authentic as Cleveland asian food goes and it has really authentic food that I wouldn't be able to order at LiWah or Siam Cafe. The other thing I love about this place is the owner is reallyyy friendly and for the price you pay, you sure get a HUUGEE serving of food that will last more than a meal!

Recommended dishes: I don't know if I'd be able to recommend a specific dish but the one dish I somehow end up ordering there is the Baby Bamboo with Pork dish. The other one is this noodle soup (only on their chinese menu and only served during dinner) called Dai Lu Mein. 

To Try for Comparison: If you want, you can order their General Tso's or Orange Chicken. I usually don't order that but all my cleveland friends who have all LOVE their orange chicken and general tsa's chicken because there are the chicken aren't completely covered in the batter. 

Least liked dish: the only dish here I'm not a huge fan of is their beef wide rice noodles. And honestly, I'm surprised that that is the 1 dish they do not make well there since it is such a common dish (you can find it almost at any chinese restaurant)",1

Alright, this place has the best authentic Chinese food one can ask for (in North East Ohio). Family style tables (like in Dim Sum restaurants) with smaller booths, this place feels comforting right when you take your seat. When I enter the restaurant, I am always greeted and seated right away (when it is not too busy) and the wait staff is quick to ask you for your preferred beverage. I've been here a couple times so far and I have not have one bad item! Everything I tried so far is delicious and sometimes I end up ordering the same thing. That should prove how good the food is. The sweet and sour spare ribs is a must order and will definitely fill you up and also your party members'. If you want an amazing Chinese dining experience, come here and nowhere else (when you're in/close to the Richmond area)!",1
I2lDmQHDxnUKbEBJuJCW6w,"Excellent chinese food, and very authentic.  I love their pan fried noodles.  One order is enough for two people.  Their beef stew is delicious too.  Prices are very affordable for the amount of food.  I would highly recommend.",1
I2lDmQHDxnUKbEBJuJCW6w,"So there are really only two mostly-authentic Chinese places in Cleveland.  One of them is Wonton Gourmet.  But everybody knows about that one.  The other is this restaurant, Hunan East.  Admittedly, it's a bit out of the way, and the decor leaves not much to be desired, and one time they undercooked a fish that we ordered, but it'll do.  They have menus in both Chinese and English, and both Chinese and Americanized menu options.

The food is not the best, but considering its location in fabulous Cleveland, it's pretty nice.  I'd totally come here more often if the restaurant moved its location maybe a couple of miles to the west.",1

After hearing about this place from fellow yelper, Joyce P., I had to go and try this place.

Now, the parking kind of sucks since it's downtown. However, if you work downtown or if it's not 5pm, then you'll be fine- I usually can circle the blocks once or twice and find some parking. :P

Nonetheless, you walk in and this place is cool. Hip. Clean. Modern. Nicely done.

They have a wealth of asian teas, and even some bubble teas. I haven't tried the coffee yet. Being a fan of brown rice teas, I ordered the genmaicha- it was brewed well and was delicious. There were so many other flavors I wanted to try- I'll definitely be back. But huge kudos on the authenticity! Just from that one cup, I know this place is solid on their asian teas. 

Check it out if you want a good cup of asian tea- I highly recommend it!",1
IAbq5UuXX_hJbxTOB5suWQ,"Oh my god! Why I didn't visit this cool place earlier?! The coffee tasted fantastic and they do offering authentic and great quality tea from Japan, Taiwan and China. Once you tried their stuff, you wouldn't go back to Starbucks or other chain stores seriously! The space is neat and cozy! Perfect for get together, reading and study!!! I will definitely come here every time when I go back

I am saying this because I am a true tea lover. And I am so glad that we have such a wonderful place here to taste some real Asian tea. 

First of all, they have variety of chose, and all of them are better than normal. You can really tell what's the difference between green, black, white and puer tea. 

Enjoy tea is like enjoy wines in Western culture, it is more of a sense and concept than taste. I like the way they putting drinking in a glass pot. In that way, (to be continue )",1
IAbq5UuXX_hJbxTOB5suWQ,A very cute very authentic asian coffee shop. Has a lovely and clean atmosphere. My friend and I stumbled upon it very early in the morning waiting for a bus and was pleasantly surprised. The small cup made with care definitely brightened and warmed our day in a cold Cleveland morning and they do have pastries that compliment the drinks well. Next time I really want to try their bubble teas and is excited to return.,1
IAbq5UuXX_hJbxTOB5suWQ,Haven't came here in a while and randomly decided to stop in. I love how modern looking and simplistic this place is. The matcha latte tastes authentic and is my go to drink. I also enjoy the pretty latte art. I'll be back soon to try the bubble tea!,1
IAbq5UuXX_hJbxTOB5suWQ,"I really like Vintage Tea & Coffee. I've been several times and it's about time that I write a review.

First of all, the owner Jeff, apprenticed with Rising Star and learned from them for over a year about coffee. They brew and sell Rising Star beans here. I tried something new here - the barista suggested a mocha-ccino, a cross between a capuccino and mocha. Super good. Their matcha drinks are also super good.

He's also Taiwanese and has an authentic bubble tea recipe from Taiwan (no powder here!) It's pricier than other places, but it's because he uses real tea and very good ingredients. I've had the black milk tea, and it's delicious.

Then, onto the teas. Jeff selects the teas with great care and he knows a LOT about them. He has a great selection of Chinese, Japanese, and Taiwanese teas - including some that are really rare and hard to find. I've never been disappointed with any of the teas I've tried (or its presentation!) 

Interior is clean, modern, and updated. I love the chalkboard art, which is all done by their barista, Loc (a CIA student). The tea menu also has beautiful Chinese and Japanese characters too! 

I've grabbed things to go and I've also stayed and chatted with friends or worked on the computer (free wifi). In either case, I've always had a great experience.",1

Not only is this pasta as fresh & handmade as one could wish for, but it's delicious & FULL of flavor! Oftentimes places with ""flavored"" pastas have flavors that barely come through, but this company serves pasta that has its flavors come through in every bite you take.

All of which were to die for & full of love & flavor in every bite!!! Shhh...dont tell anyone, but this company puts all my local pasta makers to shame. It's that good!!

I ordered the 5 course and just told the waitress whatever they wanted to give me ill eat. First course Meat tasting app with different sausages, chicken loaf and pickled veggies.

Next course Tuna tartar with egg yolk and capers and cream, starting to rise out of the inferno and into the shadows of purgatory.

I can see St. Peter in the distance at what looks like pearly gates. This restaurant gets my Tremont stamp of approval.

I'm writing this review purely on the Late Night Noodles. 

First off, I was impressed by the options they had with both the noodles and the broth types (see photo of the menu). They had non-meat based broths, but I went with the ramen option with the pork broth. I love my ramen, so I've been on a mad journey trying to find authentic ramen here in Cleveland. (I am still looking, by the way). The pork broth itself wasn't the typical salty broth that is usually associated with ramen. It had a faint pork flavor but was more watered down (and slightly sweeter) than I expected. I suspect the broth is supposed to be universal for the other types of noodles that they have, like the udon noodles. Added to the ramen was a poached egg, mustard greens, cabbage, shiitake mushrooms, pork belly, and some shredded nori on top. The ramen noodles looked like the dried ramen noodles that you would get at the Asian store. Not as oily as the ones in those Top Ramen packets. I have to say that I really liked the toppings added to the noodles. The egg is runnier than a normal soft boiled egg that ramen has - I would have never put a poached egg and ramen together, but it worked!!! The choice of veggies added a slight bitter taste to the ramen, while the shredded nori added a subtle flavor of seaweed. The shiitake mushrooms had a strong lemon taste to them, as if they had been soaked in lemon juice, which nicely cut the fattiness of the pork belly. The pork belly, by the way, was cut into thinner slices and wasn't overpowering. For those who like spicy, they gave the table the togarashi seasoning. I did add a spoonful or two, but it definitely changes the flavor. 

We came a little after the Late Night Noodles started and were seated right away. When we mentioned that we were there for the noodles, they graciously removed all the extra plates, utensils, and menus. They were quick to take our order (well, we made our choices rather fast out of excitement and hunger). It took about 15 - 20 minutes to get our food once ordered, and the rest was history! I barely had enough time to remember to take a picture of my food before I scarfed it down. 

Overall, I was less than impressed with their version of ramen and the broth - I would not recommend Dante's Late Night Noodles if you are looking for ramen. On the plus side, I didn't leave feeling like I had my week's worth of sodium intake or felt like the pork belly was clogging my arteries as I walked out. I'll have to try different combinations of noodles with broth. For $10 for a full bowl, I would say it is worth it to come back.",1
Ih0f0UyhFufm3C7kR72DSQ,"Best of Cleveland! Of course, Dante is an upscale restaurant. It is worth to try out for a special occasion. Your partners will love this place if you take them for anniversaries and stuff. (Reservations are recommended). 

I am amazed at this restaurant's creativity. We showed up without a reservation on Saturday night, but of course the restaurant was full. So we waited at bar for about 30 mins til the seating was ready. The bartender, David who workd there are real pro. Every single cocktail he made was superb. 
From the cocktail menu, presentation to its quality, I felt as if I was in a trendy restaurant in West Hollywood. I was very happy.
I truly think that having a skilled, experienced bartender is a huge part of restaurant's success. Always ask for David!

(Appetizers)
""Hawaian Tuna Tartare"": My partner really loved this dish, which he described as ""Ocean version of Corned beef hash"". The palate was nothing like an ordinary Tuna Tartare but an art like a painting from Comtemporary art museum. The Chef's criativity was clear to see. Dayboat Scallop Gratin was very tasty too.

""Crispy Calamari and Rock Shrimp"" very good fritto. they are tiny and very light, melts in your mouth. The chilli spicy mayo goes great.

""Oysters"" Their oysters easily beated lola's. Wow they are so fresh. luv! It's so worth $14 for 6.

""Dayboat Scallop Gratin"" What I love about this dish is that you get to smell and taste the ocean. The  Holandaise sauce does not kill the freshness of the scallop, which is amazing! It comes with a scallop shelf . This scallop is the best thing in Cleveland.

(Risotto)
""Carnaroli Heirloom tomato"" Very good simple italian risotto with strong garlic flavor. luv.

""Black Forbidden Rice"" is our favorite dish of the dinner.This apperizer size risotto is only $5!! But it is not tiny at all. It's got al dente cooked black rice, well seasoned rock shrimp, green onion on top and seasoned perfectly. Every ingredient in the risotto works great with each other.

""Amaranth, grapes Pancetta""
Sorry, i did not know what Amaranth was. I order it assuming it would be a rice risotto. Ok, so it is quinoa. 

(Pasta)
""Linguine alla Carbonara"" The poached egg highlighted the dish. Usually carbonara can be heavy in cream but this one was very light! 

""Pappardelle Bolognese"" The Pappaardelle, a broad fettuccine, was very nice. This perfectly cooked al dente pasta complimented the ragu sauce.

(Main)
""Rib-eye steak"" for entree was HUGE! I did say OMG at the table.
It was good but did not beat the rib eye at Lola's.  


*5 course tasting menu($60) is a good deal. 

I visited Dante for the LATE NIGHT NOODLE. We had miso and shoyu ramen. Although the noodle was nothing authentic nor original but an instant noodle, the pork in the soup reminded me of ""Kakuni"" of Japanese cuisine and it was very very soft, quality pork, juicy.  
Lola and Dante are my two favorite restaurants for their style, food presentation, ambience, especially the quality drinks and food.

But I prefer Chef Dante Boccuzzi. I think he is very kind and a nice guy for offering their risotto/pasta as a tasting for $5 and as an appetizer for $9. It is insanely kind of Dante Boccuzzi. 
Plus there are free candies at the door!!",1
Ih0f0UyhFufm3C7kR72DSQ,"I recently discovered that Dante has a LATE NIGHT NOODLES menu - they serve their version of Japanese Ramen noodles after 9:30 pm on weekdays and 10 pm on weekends.  So of course, I was very excited to check this out....

Late night noodles - 2.5 stars.
Unfortunately, the noodles were a flop.  Got to try miso and pork broths with ramen and somen noodles.  They were not the slightest bit authentic.  The ramen was similar to the instant ramen that you can get in packages at the grocery store, and not your traditional Japanese ramen.  The somen was a little better.  The miso tasted like the miso soup you would get as appetizers in a Japanese restaurant; not the miso broth that you would have with your ramen in a traditional ramen place.  The pork broth tasted like beef, and it was definitely not your typical tonkotsu broth, but it was fine.  The pork belly chunks in the soup were pretty good and tender so the soup was fine overall, but not worth staying up late for.

The rest of Dante - still 5 stars.
The linguini carbonara is still the best pasta I've ever eaten.  Get the tasting portion so you have a greater ratio of egg to pasta.  Break open that egg and let it permeate through the pasta noodles.  Yum :)

It's not a Tim Ho Wan by any means, but it's pretty darn good Ohio Chinese food. All the staples, eg ha cao + xiu mai, are pretty standard and what you'd expect. The BBQ pot bun (hum bao) wasn't good - meat tasted/smelled old. Jasmine tea was like 60c a person - should be this cheap or free in authentic Chinese places. The stuffed eggplant dish was my favorite - probably the best variation I've had. Despite the restaurant being pretty authentic (including a large Chinese clientele), the servers spoke pretty good English and were mostly attentive. When we asked for sticky rice, one waitress brought out both dim sum varieties for us to choose from. Food comes out fast and the carts circulate often, and we were not pressured in to ordering more food. A bit expensive for dim sum ($50 for 3 people), but we may have just ordered more than typical people as we were all stuffed by the end and couldn't finish about one small plate of food left.",1

That said, it's fairly authentic and therefore a pretty good choice. They use carts which I prefer because the food comes fast and furious. A good selection of just about everything with few exceptions. Fresh fish in the tanks and a small butcher area for take out pork, chicken, duck, etc.

It's a decent sized restaurant so you're almost always guaranteed a table or a very short wait. Parking can fill up but the main street provides easy alternatives to the lot.

The restaurant is in a strip mall of sorts that's connected to some souvenir shops, small businesses and the Park To Shop Asian grocery. Visiting each of these after our meal and loading up on low cost groceries at PTS has become a ritual.

They have the carts come out on weekends, but they offer a selection of dim sum from the kitchen every single day.

The service: They gave us menus which had pictures of all the dim sums that were being served. This actually really helped to choose what you want or ask for something you like. All the little Asian ladies with their carts were really nice and helpful bringing food I asked for even though it wasn't on their particular cart. 

The food: Definitely exceeded my expectations. I had been told it's not as good as Dim Sum in Toronto or Chicago, but I actually thought it was comparable.

If you get there during their peak hours, probably 12 -2 pm, please expect some wait. Try to avoid those hours and skip the wait. 
We got there around 1, which has a long line in front of us, and most of the people are party of 3 or more. With just 2 of us, we were able to skip the line and get a 2-person small table almost right away.
Their dim sum were nothing fancy, just like one of those small dim sum place in Hong Kong for local people. They have a wide range of varieties. While enjoying their dim sum on the salty side, don't forget to order the tofu dessert!!

Li Wah is a bit more upscale Canto food.  In NYC or the Bay or LA, this would get a 3 or so.  But so far, in CLE, it's rather high up.  :)

For the record, I know Eileen and Ryan who are Chinese from California.  I am Cantonese, and go to Hong Kong once to thrice a year for various reasons... including eating.   It's reasonably authentic, promise.  Oh, and Toronto, in 1995-2004, was the hands down best city for Dim Sum in North America.  A lot of those chefs have moved back to HK or retired now...  :(",1
ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg,"This was my first dim sum so I don't have much to compare it to but I  loved it! Everything I had was great minus the tripe but that's just personal taste. It was very crowded inside but we didn't have to wait long for a table. The service was really great as well. The only thing I didn't like was that I really didn't know what I was eating. The food was very authentic and I really didn't know much about Dim Sum. Either way, it was delicious and I hope to be back soon.",1
ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg,"Went here for Dim Sum on Chinese New Year...  Was greeted by a long, long line extending out of the restaurant and Lion Dancer's.  I've been here before - it's always packed - with mostly Asian folks, which is a good sign.

I've only been here for Dim Sum, and the Dim Sum is good, solid Cantonese style, with a decent variety.  They have things that will meet a midwestern palate, such as shumai, char siu (basically bbq pork) but also more traditional offerings, such as all things tripe :), mung bean pastries, asian greens, and chicken feet (which I haven't tried, but hear they are good).

Don't expect many vegetarian options.  Don't expect it to be east/west coast.  Expect it to be good, pretty authentic, and a fun way to spend a saturday afternoon.  Try the custard filled buns - they are unassuming, but wonderful.  You'll be hooked, I promise.",1
ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg,"I have now been there both for their Dim Sum service and their normal dinner service. Their Dim Sum sim is absolutely the best in the Cleveland area, bar none. I have gone with several groups, including those who are sticklers for authentic Chinese dim sum, and they agree with me that Li Wah is THE place to get good Dim Sum in Cleveland.

Their normal dinner service is not too different from other restaurants outside that they offer a abridged dim sum menu that you can order combinations from. It was very good. I ordered the tried and true General Tso's combination and was very happy with my choice. I definitely recommend this restaurant to all fans of dim sum and Chinese food in general.",1
ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg,"Li Wah is an authentic Chinese restaurant along with Bo Loong and Siam Cafe located at the heart of Asia town in Cleveland. As you sit here, do realize that there are two menus -- the American-Chinese menu a.k.a. the solo menu for ""westerners"" accustomed to having one meal all for themselves OR the authentic Chinese menu, a.k.a. the group menu which features several large dishes meant to be shared.

In the group menu, I'd go for steamed whole grouper, yang chow fried rice, salt-baked fish fillet or pork. If in a larger group, one could also order a set course menu of several courses. Again, all served in the middle of the table, meant to be shared.

If you're here for dimsum, order things like the pork shumai, shrimp dumpling, pork spareribs, steamed pork buns, or chicken feet if you're up for it.

If you're clueless or actually appear clueless, they'll give you the American menu so that you can enjoy your General Tso chicken, whoever he is.",1
ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg,"Li Wah is some of the best Cantonese food that Cleveland has to offer.  It offers an awesome selection of dim sum at lunch as well as a comprehensive Cantonese menu.  This restaurant, on E. 30th and Payne Ave. in Chinatown is an anchor tenant to the Chinese plaza where it is located.

The dim sum has been a five star experience the last few times I have visited.  Carts are pushed around with all the entrees that I crave.  Fresh-baked bbq pork buns, sui mai, ha gow, turnip cakes, and deep-fried taro are all available on a minute's notice.  On the weekends at lunch time, there is virtually no wait for a cart to arrive with all the staples.  I have had dim sum in many cities around the U.S. and China, and this place is my favorite!

Cantonese dishes are also popular, with the usual American dishes as well as authentic Chinese menu items.  The last time I visited, the Cantonese lobster had very fresh lobster.  The sauce seemed a little different than the lobster sauce I am used to, with sliced pieces of pork instead of minced pork.  There is nothing better than pulling fresh lobster off of the shell.  The chicken we ordered was also very fresh and tasted like it was made to order.  Tofu and clams were executed well.

I would recommend this restaurant for anyone looking to entertain family and friends are in the downtown Cleveland area.",1
ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg,"Had a really nice dim sum brunch on a Saturday here. The food was fresh, authentic, and delicious: mussels, bbq pork buns, pork and shrimp dumplings, chicken and pig's feet, beef tendon, turnip cake, xiajiao, and preserved egg and pork congee were all winners. We'll be back!",1
ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg,"One of the only places for dim sum in Cleveland with comparable prices to other restaurants.  Every time I go, I see more Asians that I have ever seen in Cleveland in one place.  The location is large and airy with enough seating for the bustle of a busy Saturday Morning.  It is a good place to sit and have some authentic Cantonese food.

The waiter staff was surprisingly helpful and quick.  Our water was refilled more than once without asking and I was able to ask our waiter for dishes that I didn't see on the carts.   He was more than efficient in finding them and bringing them back to our table.  When we were ready, I was able to flag down our waiter almost instantly to get our check and another waiter without even asking took our check away because he saw that my card was with the bill.  That is good service

When I go, I always get the tripe, egg tart custards, pork pastry, and several other shrimp dishes.  I don't normally get whole duck or crispy pork belly here as it is a bit on the expensive side but they have it fresh in the front of the restaurant if you are interested.  Overall, I would go here to get my Dim sum fix in a heartbeat but I don't know if I would drive several hours for the food.",1
ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg,"We came to Li Wah to entertain several guests.  We ordered authentic Chinese dishes and unfortunately none of them were good.  They were all cold and they didn't have any distinguishing flavor.  The roast duck was cold and salty.  Eggplant in a casserole with salt fish had no salt fish and the eggplant was deep fried and burnt.  The beef with tendon casserole tasted old.  The server suggested a scallop with black pepper dish - the scallops were small and haphazardly fried with a few slivers of green peppers and onions.  The only dishes that were decent were the stir fried vegetables: pea tips with garlic, and kong xin cai with garlic....but it's difficult to get those dishes wrong.

I would definitely not go here again.",0
ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg,"Dinning at Li Wah is always enjoyable for the family, we tend to go there for Dim Sum and have been there several times for dinner. Li Wah is one of the only authentic Chinese restaurants we have found in the greater Cleveland area, their dishes in Dim Sum are similar to places we have eaten in Hong Kong and come out on traditional carts. Some favorites are the Pork Congee, Shrimp Balls (sometimes you need to order as they do not always have these on the carts). The pork with black bean is yummy, while the Shrimp with Eggplant is a must if you like Eggplant! 
Would highly recommend Li Wah and will be visiting there again soon!",1
ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg,"Nested in a little shopping mall of sorts, I was pleasantly surprised that this dim sum place was open so late (we arrived close to midnight on the way back from Cedar Point). Ordered a couple dim sum dishes since the carts obviously were not out and about this late at night and as such, there was no one in the restaurant other than us. Surprised how quickly the order came as most dim sum places I've been to before tend to struggle with made-to-order outside of dim sum cart hours. I will say that the dim sum here is pretty good, not the best I've had, but definitely good enough to be considered relatively authentic. Dumplings, eggplant, shu mai, you name it, there's a decent list of dim sum options, at least from what I can remember when taking a cursory look at the menu. Would definitely come here the next time I'm in the area, although I certainly would be open to trying some of the others that local folk have said are good, too. As it's in a small shopping area, parking tends to be limited so do keep that in mind when coming during weekends, when it tends to be more busy.",1
ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg,"Best dim sum in the area, and authentic Chinese cooking.

I come here almost every weekend when I'm in town.  We also come here with friends for a great way to share lots of small dishes together over tea and laughs.  It's a giant restaurant, so there's never a wait.  The carts go around frequently, and they have dim sum late into the afternoon (I think we came at 2:30 and had dim sum once).

I also love their black bean mussels (they don't always have it, but I always ask).

Not quite the LA dim sum quality, but the best I've been able to find so far in all of Cleveland and Cincinnati.

-----------------------------------
Explanation of my rating system -
5*: Epitome of something, the best I've had, would LOVE to go back
4*: Great food and happy to go back regularly, but not the best of the category
3*: Food is fine.  I may spontaneously decide to go there based on convenience.  But no need to go back either.
2*: If you insist, I guess I'll come along. I'll find something to eat. But I wouldn't have picked it.
1*: No plans to come back.  I'll try to talk companions out of going.",1
ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg,"Located in the Asian Plaza in Cleveland with huge dining space. Li Wah looks more of a authentic traditional Chinese restaurant styled in 90s. With a good menu selection and seasonal seafood choices, this place would serve most Chinese residents well. Li Wah also features authentic Cantonese Dim Sum, which really is worth a try for some. However, apparently this place still needs a bit more of sincerity and expertise in culinary skills if they want to fill up the extensive space regularly. Dim Sum items are must-have, and their Roasted Duck is good as well.",1
ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg,This is not authentic Chinese food. Ordered three dim sum dishes for 12.95 and the spicy fish. The flavor is okay but not what I expected. But the service is really great here.,0
ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg,"A family favorite, my kids can't get enough of shu Mai. We've been coming here for over 25 years. Very authentic food and could be intimidating to less adventurous crowds. Best part is dim sum on Sunday's. A great way to try new dishes with the smaller portions.",1
ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg,"Wow, China town brought authentic to a whole new level. I dined here with my best friend and his family, for brunch, and they gave me the inside scope of the ""do eats and don'ts"" from dining so often as this was a local place his grandfather use to bring his father, then later my friend, Greg.

Although I am not one to know much about Asian food, they filled me in on what to know. Here's the scoop; carts get pushed around and you order from what you see, or the menu, but go by vision. Although I am unsure of the technical names of the dishes I ate, I can assure you, it is all FABULOUS. What an awesome experience of trying foods I had never tasted, but to be apart of it all? Awesome, especially with a line out of the door, so get there early.

Eat the following; sticky buns with pork, rolled rice with pork stuffed inside, green vegetables with oyster sauce, and the pastries with the yellow filling.


Take a chance and order it, you'll love the whole experience!",1
ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg,"Good place for morning tea and dim sum. Could be very crowded any day after 11:30 am since it serves the entire Asian population of Cleveland and around. Service was friendly. Shiu mai, shrimp dumplings and chicken claws were nice and authentic. Egg tarts and congee were a bit too small. Also offer something called Almond Tofu with pineapple on top. Never tried it before but it was quite a good dessert.",1
ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg,"Great food.  The food was sweeter than the Cantonese food I've had in China.   Some of the best Chinese food I've had in the US.   I wished they had more authentic Sichuan dishes.  However, it was delicious.",1
ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg,"Great food, service was ok, took long time to get someone to take my order,
Very nice menu, dim sum great, very Chinese, plenty of selection, go here and enjoy authentic Chinese. Very nice.",1
ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg,"This is the first time I've experienced an actual authentic Chinese restaurant. I only ordered one dim sum dish that was pretty tasty. My Main course was the szechuan chicken and my friends dish was the Thai curry chicken. I requested the dish to be extra spicy which it was not, nor was it even slightly spicy at all. In the end when we were paying for our meals separately and they charged us an extra 10$ (5$ a piece) for no apparent reason. We asked about it and two waitress tried to argue there was no mistake. One tried to say its for taxes. There's no such thing as 5$ for taxes with 10-15 dollar dishes. Eventually another waitress came by and said its wrong, which after we got 5$ each in cash for being over charged. Besides the non spicy dish I ordered and being overcharged, I MIGHT come here again, just for the ""authentic"" experience. **Make sure you're not overcharged.",0
ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg,"I was dating a guy who asked me if I had ever been for Dim Sum, I hadn't, and I wasn't even sure what it was. 

After he explained it to me I decieded it sounded exactly like something I would love, so we headed to Li Wah's on a Sunday morning. 

When you walk in the shopping mall, you see a lot of designer knock off purses, and Li Wah's enterance. Some might find that a bit ""seedy"" but trust me, you'll get over it. 

The staff is friendly, even if they barely speak a lick of English. 

I was really pleased to see Asian's, EVERYWHERE, and all of them enjoying their food. That's always a good sign, especially since I have never been to any parts of Asia, so for me I go by my taste buds and not ""authentic"" or ""not authentic.""

Needless to say I really enjoyed my experience. I have been back several times since. 

If you have dietary restrictions or an aversion to certain things then I wouldn't reccomend Dim Sum simply because half the people pushing the carts don't know what's in it. They'll agree with you or disagree with you to get you to buy whatever their selling. 

Go when it's busy because the food is fresh and you get a better variety from the carts. You can also order things from the menue and they will promptly be brought to the table. 

Do not guzzle your drink down, it's almost impossible to get a refill depending on how busy they are. The servers always seem distracted to me. 

All in all I love this place. It is what it is. Good food for hungry people.",1
ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg,"The food was good! I enjoyed the vast variety and the authentic pieces like durian pastries (I couldn't get my table to try chicken feet with me. Fun fact, I have had them before, though not here, and they are really good). VERY fast paced, which I argue is intentional because you tend to eat a lot more than normal that way and thus, a higher bill. I just felt like it was a bit on the heavier foods and would have liked to see some lighter options. Would I go back though? Absolutely.",1
ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg,"Growing up in Cleveland, Li Wah is one of the best restaurants with tasty dim sum. In bigger cities, such as Los Angelos and Manhattan, there are obviously more varieties in appetizers, main dishes and desserts, however with the small Chinese population in Cleveland, I would say we are pretty lucky to have Li Wah around! 

I have been going here since I was a kid for brunch, dinner, and even wedding receptions. We come as a family or bring friends from out of town to this dining location. The food is phenomenal, and to this day, I love introducing friends and coworkers to share a bit of my culture through food! 

Be warned that a majority of the dim sum dishes are composed of pork or shrimp or a combination of the two. If you decide to go with the dim sum option, it is best if you come with a Chinese speaking friend so you don't order anything surprising! Most dim sum dishes are for sharing, so don't be upset if your friend takes a dumpling of ""yours."" My favorite (and all the kids' favorite) dim sum dish are the Siu Mai, which are the pork and shrimp dumplings. If you order straight from the menu, food choices are pretty straight forward and if you need some explanation, most of the servers are able to explain to you in English. My favorite from the menu options is the Pan Fried Noodle with Seafood dish. Thinking about it is just making my mouth water... yum! 

Dim sum runs from 10 am - 3 pm on weekdays (with limited options) and 10 am - 4 pm on weekends. Menu items can be ordered throughout the day. 

I highly recommend Li Wah for authentic Chinese food!",1
ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg,"I recently went here for the first time in years and was pleasantly surprised. Everything I got was so delicious! I definitely think Li Wah is on par with dim sum restaurants in big cities such as NYC.

It was incredibly busy when I stopped in on a Sunday but luckily I didn't have to wait long for a table. I ordered hot tea for my family, which used to be free back then but isn't anymore. My favorite dishes I tried were the beef tripe, chicken feet, stuffed eggplant and shumai. I love dipping everything in chili oil for an extra kick. 

The only negative thing I have to say is that I wish they had more variety. It felt like I kept seeing the same dishes over and over again on the food carts. Besides that, this is the place to go for an authentic dim sum experience in Cleveland and I cannot wait to return!",1
ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg,"I was visiting my friends who just moved to Cleveland (actually Westlake which is lovely) and they took us to Li Wah. My friend is Chinese so when she said this was the only decent place for dim sum that she has found, I knew it would be good. 
Now some of their selections are authentic Chinese, like the tripe, chicken feet, and I forgot the rest, but I'm not that into those items. The variety of dumplings were really good and they had Chinese Broccoli that was perfectly done (not fainting in the dish with a whole bunch of oyster sauce). They had Mexican doughnuts  (yes, that's what they are called) which is one of my favorite desserts when I have dim sum. It was all great. 
The table next to me had a plate of HUGE crab legs that looked delicious but I kept myself under control. 
So if you are in Cleveland visit Li Wah's.",1
ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg,"Neat place. Dim Sum was good but didn't blow my socks off. Some dumplings we liked more than others. It's definitely a fun experience. They come around with little carts of dim sum, pork buns, soups, and noodles and just load you up with whatever you want: an authentic experience. Service was quick...you weren't without food for long until another cart came by. They are not very helpful at explaining what's inside the dumplings or buns though....language barrier and all...but it probably doesn't matter much because the food is overall pretty yummy. Again...not the BEST I've had, but probably the best in the area at least. 

For those who don't know, the dim sum service happens M-F from 10-2. You don't order off the menu for dim sum. They come around to your table with a cart, ask what you want , then put it on your table. Usually you get 3-4 dumplings per serving. They leave a check on your table that serves as a tally sheet where they keep track of everything you choose from the cart. 

It's a neat experience. You should try it!",1
ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg,Original Chinese restaurant with authentic flavor. I really enjoy going there once in a while when I'm craving for Chinese Food.,1
ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg,"I haven't been here to try their dim sum, but I have gotten delivery from them courtesy of delivery service delivermefood.com

Compared to Great Taste which I had in my first week in Cleveland, Li Wah definitely affords a more authentic and wider range of dinner options.

+ House special pan fried noodles: no, this isn't that chow mein fried noodle crap that belongs on ""asian salads"". This is legitimate Cantonese-style wok fried noodles with a seafood/meat/veggie sauce that goes over it. Delivery separates the two so you can combine it at your leisure, eliminating the fear of receiving a soggy sopping mess. I swear, If you don't order this dish from Li Wah for dinner, you will fail. This dish is hard enough to find in Chicago's Chinatown, but you'll find it at Li Wah.
+ House special fried rice: better quality rice than Great Taste, but they skimp on the meat and veggies making it mostly rice. Delicious otherwise.
+ Pan fried dumplings: the rectangular/open-end kind of dumpling that has been lightly pan-fried. I like this rendition just as much as the round dumpling kind. Accompanying sauce is excellent.
+ Shrimp chips: if you like them less shrimpy/gamey than Great Taste's, I would recommend getting a bag of them. It's only $1.50!

- Shrimp won ton soup: maybe I need to have it fresh, but the dumplings were a bit soggy. Also, the soup is a tad on the salty side. Scallions on top are a nice touch though.
- Egg roll: I guess I'm not a huge fan of the bulbous looking deep fried egg rolls. I don't know how to explain it, but really if the skin of the fried egg roll looks smooth, I like. If it's pocketed and obviously fried beyond crisp, I no like.

Get the house special pan fried noodles!",1
ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg,"This is one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in the city of Cleveland. They have authentic dim sum presented on dim sum carts. The food is a very good quality and service hot. It's like having the same type of food you can find in New York, Toronto, San Francisco but it's here in Cleveland. The dumplings are always very delicious. There are many different choices of dim sum.",1
ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg,Li wah is one of the more authentic Chinese restaurants in Cleveland. Get there on Sundays for dim sum before the crowds do.

ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg,"Been here for dim sum and its great.  Maybe not like Hong Kong but pretty good anyway.   There are few options for dim sum in Cleveland and this place is worth visiting.  Very clean, good food and service.  Patience may be required as its authentic Chinese right down to a lot of the people who work there that don't speak much (if any) English.",1
ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg,"I noticed that there are a lot of references to the Dim Sum here. Unfortunately I came here for an event and didn't get a chance to get the authentic ""Dim Sum"" experience here. We got a buffet specially for the event I was attending. Only dim sum dishes I got to try were the har gow, shumai and the steamed buns. I think the har gow and shumai were decent and the steamed buns were dry. 

The other dishes we tried included noodles, cream cheese wontons, sesame chicken and something else I can't remember. I wasn't too impressed but to be fair I should come for a regular meal.",0
ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg,"This place caters to a non-Asian palate. Coming from the nyc area, I had a really hard time liking any of the dishes here. The service was great however and I have heard this is the best place in Cleveland. So if you want a fix, this would be the place to go. 

The tofu skin rolls only had pork in it (not the usual bamboo and mushroom mixture) and somehow the skin was dry and rubbery (despite being in a sauce). 
The shrimp rolls were over cooked. The rice noodle outside fell apart and had no chew. 
The xlb were completely broken when they arrived to the table. 
The sticky rice in banana leaf had almost no filling just lots of rice
The shrimp shumai were ok. I usually get this with a side of mustard and hot sauce. 
The chicken feet probably had the most authentic flavor however we're served lukewarm.",0
ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg,Great place for authentic Dim Sum in Cleveland.  Just like the places in NYC and San Francisco. The women who push the carts around are very helpful and friendly.  Lots of delicious choices!,1
ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg,"It's the only place in town for good dim sum. Today was not such a crazy busy morning here. We were sat promptly and we received excellent service. 

Exterior: located in Asia Plaza around East 30th in Cleveland. 

Interior: Asian decor. Green lights along the ceiling. Roasting whole ducks in a case. Bright red columns with gold Asian writing in then. It's a large restaurant that can accommodate a lot of people and large parties. 

Clientele: there are a lot of Asian people here. That's a good sign. Anybody who loves this type of food could be here. 

Food: I personally think it's excellent. Good Chinese is hard to find. This is as authentic as it gets. They have several off menu selections that most people would not order. They have tripe and weird organ dishes. 

Final thoughts: we had excellent service today. The food was wonderful!",1
ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg,"My favorite Asian restaurant in the Cleveland area.  We're Asians who grew up in San Diego, CA so we know what good Asian food should taste like.  Li Wah is very authentic and fair pricing.  I especially love their shrimp wonton noodle soup & order takeout on a weekly basis after getting off work.  On the weekends, we frequent their dim sum which are filled with very good selections.  We also love the stir fried lobster w/ noodles.  The customer service is always great whether we order takeout or dine in.",1
ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg,"I am really shocked that this is not rated as a 5 star because, if rating solely on food, it is authentic perfection.  Granted it is in a hole in the wall shopping plaza,but I am basing this rating on the food as it holds its own.  Actually, the surrounding shops are really fun to look at, more on that later.  This is the second time my husband and I have eaten here for Sunday Dim Sum.  I highly recommend you arrive early lest you want to be part of the very long line that forms outside.  Ordering the Dim Sum can be a little intimidating.  Pick up the menu and see what looks good.  They will bring carts around and you can basically choose what you want and how many.  If things are taking a little longer than you want and can't find what you are looking for, I suggest a little prompting.  Just tell them what you are looking to find.  My favorite is the baked BBQ bun, wow just wow!  Also, love the pork and shrimp won tons.  Peking duck was not my thing but cool to watch it being roasted.  My husband's favorite is the sticky rice.  It comes wrapped in lotus leaves.  Kids came with us the second visit.  My daughter just ordered the lo  mein   Chicken meal.  She chowed down!!  Took it home and had enough for her to eat 2 more meals.  She is a fan.  We will certainly frequent this place when in Cleveland.  It's great to bring a group as Dim Sum lends itself well to the social aspect of dining with friends.   As for the nearby shops, daughter bought a dragon tea set, son found rubber nun chucks and a ginormous Pikachu stuffed animal.  Had a great time!",1
ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg,"The most delightful way to start your day! I was thoroughly impressed with Li Wah - finding it aesthetically pleasing, authentic, and appetizing. My group of 3 and I arrived around 11:30am and found the restaurant alive and busy, with about 2/3 of the seats filled. The ambiance was superb, with floral decorations, statues, and wall decor creating a rich oasis that contrasted with the murky view outside. 

Freshly prepared dim sum plates arrived on carts every 10 minutes. For someone unfamiliar with traditional dim sum plates, looking at the menu prior to arriving is a must. While the servers were able to tell us if each dish was vegetarian or non-vegetarian (many knew limited English), we had to guess the contents of each dish beyond that. Thankfully, we like to eat everything. 

Our group picked 12 plates - which included pork belly, shumai, dumplings, wontons, pork buns, Chinese broccoli, fried shrimp balls, and baked custard buns, with a pot of black tea and dipping sauces to accompany. Each dish was flavorful, though the sauce on the Chinese broccoli was extremely salty (I wiped it off). 

By the end of our meal, I had to unbutton my pants to drive back home comfortably. I highly recommend Li Wah for a potentially adventurous and social dining experience.",1
ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg,"After several years, I gave up the idea that Pittsburgh will ever get any dim sum options.  The nearest one requires a 2 hour drive to Cleveland.  I know, Chinese in Cleveland you ask?  I was quite surprised how packed it was with 99% Asian patrons.  This a good indication that it will be authentic dim sum.

I would say it is not the the best ever but adequate enough to satisfy the craving!  My usual orders at a dim sum place: Har Gow (shrimp dumplings), Xiu Mai (pork dumpings), Congee (rice soup), egg tarts (good), and sticky rice. I took the fish maw soup to go and that one I did not favor as much.

I would come back.",1
ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg,"Why is dim sum so freakin delicious? It's seriously better than brunch (sorry brunch lovers)! Coming from LA, where there is literally a dim sum restaurant at every corner, I didn't expect Cleveland to even have dim sum. But I'm pleasantly surprised by Li Wah! It has fairly authentic dim sum, with fast and friendly service. If you're new to the whole dim sum scene, I suggest starting off with some BBQ pork buns, shrimp dumplings, pork shumai and red bean buns. But if you're a hardcore dim sum-er like myself, you must try the fried steamed chicken feet and steamed ribs! 

The only complaint I have for Li Wah is that it lacks the wide selection of dim sum items I'm used to back in LA. I wish they had rolled rice noodles, leek dumplings, and taro cakes :(",1
ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg,"I'll try to keep this short. I'm upset I didn't know about this place sooner, even though I've been inside of this plaza years ago! My better half is from Hong Kong and we travel quite a lot, but have not been able to find that piece of her home here in the states. Let me tell you...this is as authentic as you are gonna find in Ohio or I would argue the East Coast. Dim Sum was spot on, portion size was almost similar to Hong Kong, and the atmosphere was spot on once inside. We got the Shumai, BBQ pork bun, and shrimp dumplings. We shared noodles, sweet and sour beef, and honey shrimp with vegetables. If you have ever been to HK and want to experience the food you had there, this place is the closest you will get in Cleveland.",1
ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg,"Li Wah is the go to place for authentic dim sum in the Cleveland area, and we are thankful to have one!

FOR FIRST TIMERS
They start rolling out their full options for lunch around 11am-11:30am, so if you're looking for a favorite dim sum dish, try not to come too early. Dim sum is served on the traditional dim sum carts- there may be a language barrier for those who cannot speak Chinese, but pointing to the food always works :) .. If there is a dish you are waiting for and haven't seen on the carts, you can always flag down a waiter/waitress and ask them to bring it to you.

Expect a wait if you are coming around 12pm; luckily, with the hustle and bustle, most of the dishes will also be fresh and piping hot. Their waiting system consists of a line where tables ready for a certain number customers are called out.

FOOD
Li Wah is the best authentic Cantonese dim sum you will find in Cleveland. Overall, you will not find a level of detail to their dim sum that other dim sum restaurants may offer at larger cities; for example, some of their dishes may not offer the same level of finishing (extra vegetables, ingredients). However, the preparation, flavors, and textures are all well prepared.

We've found Li Wah to excel at rice dishes, like their sticky rice in bamboo and congee. Both have a great texture and are packed with flavor.

ATMOSPHERE/SERVICE
The service and atmosphere is more similar to other more traditional Chinese restaurants; the service is to the point, and servers may not be easy to find. They clear dishes completed dishes quickly. Decorations are more traditional with red and gold styling. Bathrooms also are not the cleanest.

At the end of your meal, you can flag down a server for the bill, or if we are in a rush, we will sometimes bring our slip to the register.",1
IjyNFVZPLVej9de31KGTxA,"im SUPER critical of pizza spots so when i give them a good rating take it as a sign of something good. I had tried Godmothers on a desperate wimb of needing some marinara sauce one night. so i called and asked just for sauce in a container, and when i got it home i was happily surprised! it tasted like authentic pizza sauce, the pizza that makes me homesick for NYC, the pizza that you can cuddle with your nonna while eating. Grandmas sauce to the max! I then got an idea to try their other food, and their cheesesteaks did not disappoint. You get a huge sandwich for your money, stuffed with meat, cheese and whatever other toppings you want. The staff are always polite and helpful on the phone, even better when you pick it up in person. I'm so excited that i live down the street because now i know where to go when I need a true taste of Italy. Their pizza crust is perfect, not too much cheese, perfect balance of sauce and crust, crunchy bottom, not soggy. Its a 8/10 for me!",1
IjyNFVZPLVej9de31KGTxA,"I'm starting to get discouraged when it comes to only being able to review a place based on one food. But, I will say that Godmother's has some good sandwiches. 

If I wrote the review just from my wife's point of view. I think it would get 5 stars based on authenticity of the establishment. She'd been looking for a place that sold steak and cheese, that had that authentic NY feel. When they answered the phone and she heard his accent she was immediately excited. She went into full NY mode, something I hadn't seen in a while. 

Enough of that though, let's talk about the steak and cheese sandwiches that we ended up getting. We got large because we didn't expect them to be as large as they were, they were $7.50 a piece I believe, and they were HUGE! We ended up only eating half of our sandwiches apiece and warming them for lunch the next day (which they warmed just fine). The veggies and meat on the sandwiches were perfect and the bread very fresh. I'd love to see what their pizzas taste like, but I can't lie, we haven't gotten pizza from a shop since we began making our own. They do jar their own sauces though which peaks my interest.

Edit: Changing my review to 5 stars based on them being so kind as to giving Sasha and I just 3 cups of marinara sauce. P.s. it's amazing",1
Imb8EXuimCm5II7Ad1gj3A,"THE BEST FOOD AND PEOPLE. My family and I love coming here to chat and find amazing meats. First of all, the ladies are so badass and awesome. I love them! Their product is just as amazing. Everything they make is absolutely delicious. The chorizo is very authentic and delicious, all of the sausages are to die for, and the soups are so hearty and flavorful. Strongly recommend this place to anybody looking for good meats. Keep it up!",1
iNeiyfZ7MHK8dI0QZ4Ucsg,"Holy Hot Greasy Mess of Delicious Diner Eats !!! 

I love this place. Nothing new and shiny here, just good home-cooked breakfast and lunch eats that are sure to fill your belly and have you begging for tums! We frequent this spot on Sunday mornings, and offer this advice... the earlier you show up the better chances you'll have at getting a table. 

The restaurant is very casual and can get a little cramped, but it is worth the occasional spacial issue. Also, you never know who you could meet at the table next to you. 

Big Al's has the best pulled pork sandwich that I have ever had and their omelets are guaranteed to please. Also, if you want your potatoes crunchy or your omelet really custom, they will do it for you and get it right. 


 Check them out if you are looking for a delicious greasy spoon with local charm.",1
IoXcQkLpEaiv6S7ITelLWg,"This is a long overdue review but well deserved.

I'm originally from southern California, Orange County to be exact, where shabu joints are everywhere.

I love me some shabu on a gloomy day and when I saw one was opening up near me it was on my must try list. 

Well with a baby its hard to get out but I was really craving shabu so I decided to go and take the baby with me. That was a bad idea. She was fussy and didnt want to sit in her high chair. She even broke one of their spoons. Sorry!

The chef came out and talked to us saying he had a little girl himself and he made a makeshift rattle out of a bottle and rice to keep my baby entertained. She then threw our meat on the floor. Well he made us a new plate. I totally did not expect this.

Finally we got to eat and the broth was delicious the meat was nice and thin with a good amount of marbling. But the GOMA sauce...Hit the spot for me. Very authentic. The food was as good as the presentation and service. Its not cheap but I'll come back because of the service alone.",1
IoXcQkLpEaiv6S7ITelLWg,The overall setting of the restaurant is really nice and the Service is good but the food is just ok. The shabu shabu is not authentic. Had high expectation after reading all the good reviews but the food just disappointed me especially given the price they charge.,0
IoXcQkLpEaiv6S7ITelLWg,"I don't usually write reviews but, this establishment always wows me every time we go. 

A small place, seats about 25~ people, but the quality of service and food makes you thankful it is that way. The staff is able to give you a very personable experience because of it, and on top of it, one you'll never really be ready to let go after you leave.

I grew up in a really authentic Laotian household, and we did ""hot pot"" all the time. I'm extremely picky of the quality of ingredients that go into it because of the quality my family use to put into ours. I've never been disappointed going to Ushabu, and honestly I wish it was closer to where I live (probably would go WAY more often).

In detail, I loved the Ginger Chicken broth, and my SO - the spicy Togarashi Miso. I personally like the Fish Marker Omakase since the fish that comes with it change almost every time I go; however, it's always fresh and absolutely tasty. My SO on the other hand loves the Ohio Wagyu - it's always very tender and full of flavor. I'm lucky there's ever any to spare for me to try (though we do order extra a la carte meats every time). 

Best of all, they finally serve sake and wine now so all my cravings have been met. 

If you're looking for a Shabu restaurant with excellent quality of food, staff, and service, you won't find it anywhere else in CLE. I'm in love with this place and I know you will too if you give it a try.",1
IoXcQkLpEaiv6S7ITelLWg,"Came here last night for a quasi celebration, but reall, we just wanted to try out a Japanese Shabu restaurant in Cleveland. It was a new dining experience for me, but old hat for the wife.

We were seated at the bar, which holds a total of six people and offered drinks. No beer or booze, unfurtunately. They have soda, tea, some Japanese libations... nothing too interesting. The server went over some basic instructions and took our small plate order. He was a bit hard to understand, not because he was foreign, but because he spoke in that mumbly, hipster way that I'm not versed in very well.  I must say, I wasn't a fan of the stained bar top and very tight quarters... I get anxious in crowds. 

Small plates arrved - pork belly and salmon. Pork was really good and so was the salmon, even if that's not my favorite fish. By the time we finished, our main courses arrived and our pre selected broth was boiling(I apologize for not getting detailed with the ordering process, but don't want to write a book at this time). I ordered the Ohio Wagyu beef and my wife ordered the seafood; both came with an assortment of veggies, noodles and rice. We also had to try the Japanese A5 wagyu, so grabbed a couple ounces of that as well. All in all the food was good, but I think I would like to try the wagyu in a more traditional steak style. While the meat was very tender and rich, I feel the broth imparted too much flavor to the thin cuts of beef. We ended with a sorbet from Mason's Creamery and that was superp and quite refreshing.

To wrap, we liked this place, but I personally don't think a return trip is needed. The food was good, but I find the dining style clumsy and not really up my alley. One thing I was happy about was getting to try authentic wagyu, finally. I passed on it in japan, not really knowing what it was at the time, and always regretted that decision.",0

IPrtHNKwLERUKvYJGDOHtg,"A few days after Thanksgiving, we all needed a change from turkey. What better way to spice things up than to order Thai food?  We placed a gigantic order at Lemon Grass, including Pad Thai, House Fried Rice, Chicken with Pine Nuts, Green Curry Noodles, Panang Curry, Massaman Curry, Chicken Coconut Soup, Beef with Macadamia Nuts, and Pork with Green Noodles.

Everything was ready quickly - we picked up the order after about 20 minutes or so.  I'd say, given the quality of the food, it was overpriced.  Nothing was really especially good.  It was all just standard, but tasty, Thai take out.  Nothing that made us say wow.  I did enjoy the non-curry dishes the most (the fried rice and pad thai especially) - those were a little above average to me.  The curries were all fine....but they all tasted REALLY similar.  That was disappointing.  We really couldn't detect much difference between the three at all.  That was a bit disappointing.  They were so much alike that we mixed the leftovers all together and put them in the same tupperware - no reason to keep them separate.

It's fine, it's fast, and it's pretty much what you'd expect Thai takeout to be.  There might be a few standouts, but overall it's not anything you haven't had before.  I'm sure you could find more authentic and more fresh-tasting Thai food easily.",0
IPrtHNKwLERUKvYJGDOHtg,"I question the authenticity of this place, and who's in the kitchen cooking. Most of the apps are ""deep fried_____ with sweet thai chili sauce"" --gross. So we ordered spicy seafood soup and 2 entrees--chicken green curry and something called sizzling land and sea speciality blah blah. The soup is actually tom yum soup made with frozen seafood. (How do I know? You can see the mercury-like glaze over the shrimp, scallop, and squid.) Green curry should have been called chicken bathed in coconut milk and the land and sea dish was suppose to be served on a hot plate...sizzling at the table. Negative. No sizzles, no fun. 
Our server was slow. Prices are too high for the quality. On the plus side, there's a nice patio in the back.",0
IPrtHNKwLERUKvYJGDOHtg,Atmosphere is good but food is expensive for the small portion they serve. It is not exactly authentic as I have been to Thailand many times. We walked away hungry after spending over $60. Would not be back unless I have someone else to pay for it.,0
IPrtHNKwLERUKvYJGDOHtg,"I've been here twice now...and I have to say, fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me!  I have no explanation for why I went back other than, I'm new to Cleveland, I was craving Thai food, and was too lazy to some research and discover a new (good) place.  

The Thai food at Lemon Grass is average (3 stars at the most).  I had the Squid stir-fry and the squid was under cooked or overcooked (it was rubbery) and the spice was NOT hitting me like it would at a good Thai place.  Also, the service was subpar, which lowers the whole experience down to two stars.  While I was still enjoying my entree, the waiter ran up to ask us about dessert.  Dang!  Can a lady put her fork down first?  We were too polite to say ""hold up!"" so we went ahead and ordered and do you know they brought out the dessert (melting ice-cream!) before I had even finished my entree?!  Poor showing, chums! SMH.  And then you had the several waiters coming up every 3 seconds to ask us if we would like more water.  Ummm...thanks? I'm glad you don't want me to die of thirst from the last time you checked...three seconds ago!!   It was date night for me and my husband and it would have been nice to continue our conversation uninterrupted, thank you very much.  

In short, if you want to have a nice leisurely dinner with plenty of good conversation and maybe authentic spicy Thai food, Lemon Grass is NOT the place for you. Oh, and did I mention this place is overpriced? Fried crab rice was like $15!!?  And it still wasn't better than the one I had in San Francisco for $7.",0
IPrtHNKwLERUKvYJGDOHtg,"Hands down my favorite place for Thai cuisine. The Pad Thai is easily the most authentic I've eaten in the area. The prices are decent, the staff is usually very good and the atmosphere is warm and romantic. If you love authentic Pad Thai, check this place out.",1
IPrtHNKwLERUKvYJGDOHtg,"Poor Thai food.  I had samosas and orange chicken ala Thai style. This food was presented as Thai yet tasted like microwaved frozen food. My wife had the fried rice which was tasteless. (Ironically, Trader Joe's fried rice tastes better).  

Very disappointing and I will not go back unless I can go back in the kitchen and watch the preparation by the chef (is there a trained chef at this place??).

This place caters to the local crowd who appears not to demand real Thai, Mexican or Italian foods. If you want authentic cuisine go somewhere else. What a rip off.",0
IPrtHNKwLERUKvYJGDOHtg,"Ugh. This place is so incompetent, I don't even know where to begin. They mess up orders like George Lucas messes up movies. I wouldn't be surprised if I went here one day and some goddamned blinking Ewok was my server.*

The food is not terrible. It's okay, but there are certainly better Thai places around. The service is slow and it has a certain knack for getting things wrong. The interior is pretty nice, I will give them that.

I would recommend this place only if you're hanging out around Cedar/Lee and you're on the verge of knifing someone if you don't get yourself some Thai food.

ISTwdmgIjeIPan4l-bGtOQ,"Visited Cleveland to see an old buddy; and knew of this place from the venerable and much-respected Anthony Bourdain. Without ever mentioning it my buddy said we had to drop by and grab some authentic tubed meat!

And it was damn well worth it. We bought a huge assortment of the meaty goodness; mostly bratwursts. Ones that come to mind right now are: Maple, Irish Potato, Cheddar and Jalapeno, Garlic and Onion, Apple Links, and spicy kielbasa. We went lake-side and grilled up our meaty feast and had a great time. Awesome flavor throughout (the potato bratwursts were a bit bland but that's to be expected I think)...

The proprietors and workers were a great help and very tolerant of 4 20-somethings endlessly debating on what assortment of sausages to buy. I'd really encourage locals to go support a legitimate family business making sausage the old way. This kind of place won't be around for long I fear without local support.

Don't buy your meat from Giant Eagle. Visit these folks!",1

The reason for it not being a ""5 star"" experience is that I was asked if I'd like it spicy and I said ""yes"".

The prices were reasonable and the flavors were pretty authentic. Maybe could have used a tad more spice, but I've only had one lunch so far and I will say it is promising. I do like that there is a toppings bar to allow you to add to your dish (jalapeÁE±os, salsa, pico, cheeses, etc.).

IYpaW7h8aPYKIK84_ZKMIg,"The decor and online descriptions would suggest authentic Mexican cuisine. Instead, Puente Viejo lacks substance as it offers us inauthentic cheese, crunchy Taco Bell-style corn shells instead of corn tortillas, and burnt meat. I can think of a number of Tex-Mex restaurants in the area that do that kind of food better, and a number of taquerias where I can go for a better authentic taco. It is also worth mentioning that I could leave most other places about five dollars richer. The Margarita was the best part of the meal.",0
IYpaW7h8aPYKIK84_ZKMIg,"Stopped in for a quick bite.

Ambiance: A clean and modern looking restaurant-bar with nothing really hispanic-themed. This place is meant to be a nice place out and not a hole-in-the-wall. The fact they have margarita slushie machines should set the tone for this place. Noise was actually not a problem despite them being at capacity and the staff were friendly enough.

Food: I got a few carne asada and pastor tacos which comes with access to the taco toppings bar in the back of the restaurant. The tacos were served in medium flour tortillas larger than the typical street-style tacos that use corn tortillas. They could have used a light toasting but instead were just served just-warmed so they quickly became soggy in the meat juices. I stayed clear of the toppings bar because it was stocked with cheddar cheese and anemic-looking tomatoes, corns, and black beans. Given it was winter, they probably were using canned or frozen vegetables. It would have been nice to see some more authentic ingredients like cotija or queso fresco. In the end, however, the meat itself was tender and savory although nothing was particularly outstanding.

Overall I'd recommend Puente Viejo for people looking for a nice date spot that happens to serve mexican food. The drinks people around me had looked good but the food itself is americanized and not for those looking for an authentic experience.",0
IYpaW7h8aPYKIK84_ZKMIg,"I grew up in Texas and spent a lot of time in California and New Mexico and this is far from authentic; however, it is not too bad.  It was near the hotel in which we were staying and the Yelp reviews were generally positive so we decided to give it a try. The food is pretty bland and isn't spicy or very flavorful but you get a large amount and shouldn't go home hungry.  Service was fine and six of us ate for a little over $200 including tip.

The servers are very attentive and usually very fast as far as food coming out goes. 
Look no further than here if you're in the mood for good Mexican food. Also, it's in a great location if you're nearby for a game or a show in playhouse square because it's right between the square and Progressive/The Q.",1
IYpaW7h8aPYKIK84_ZKMIg,"My favorite Mexican restaurant in the playhouse/gateway/csu area is Puente Viejo. Large portions, reasonable pricing, and all the authentic classics you are looking for plus some modern twists. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu.

For years my wife and I would go to playhouse or the Q or Wolfstein for a fun night out but struggled to find a place with real Tex-Mex. One winter day a year or two ago we parked in our usual spot and stopped by this new tequila bar place called Puente Viejo at lunch time. I remember ordering huevos rancheros, chicken fajitas, and a blood orange margaritas. We were blown away. It was so much food we had to take some home which never usually happens downtown, and the margaritas had a fair amount of liquor, also rare these days it seems!

Now, everytime I visit I fall in love all over again. I have tried quite a few things on the menu since that first time.  They have a toppings bar for the tacos which I can't get enough of, cheesey queso, fajita enchiladas, huge burritos, and all the combination plates you expect from a Mexican restaurant in the suburbs. I can personally recommend all these dishes and my wife would give the vegetarian options two thumbs up as well.

I have admittedly neglected PV since the end of last year's Broadway series and the departure of King James from the Q. After a recent visit when going to Cinderella I can confirm PV still dunks on the competition. Next time you are downtown and craving Mexican wander into Puente Viejo and I bet you comeback for more too.",1

Fish tacos - well let's just say that they are a far cry from an authentic mahi mahi taco you would get in Southern California or Baja.

The first thing we heard while being seated at 8:40pm - was a server walking by the hostess saying - ""you know we are closing in 20 minutes"" -- hmmm, not a very good first impression.

The salsa had a garlic flavor and a low burn; certainly not the worst I have had, but not very exciting either.  The chips were a little on the greasy side.  My son eats anything, but did not finish his taquitos.  He said they tasted bland and the meat was dry.

I was excited to see a Molcajete on the menu, but when it arrived the visual appearance is not at al what I have had in Mexico.  The meat was,fine and it came with fresh cilantro, but not at all authentic.

iZfeH70e_YFLrURT8WuCYQ,"I have seen poor reviews for this restaurant on plenty of sites but have to disagree with them. I have been to El Rodeo twice now and have been very pleased every time. It is certainly the closest thing you will get to authentic Mexican food in the area. While the food is still very Americanized, it at least makes the attempt to appear and taste Mexican by easing up on the cheese sauces and odd taste combinations you find at other places in Cleveland.

I hail from southern Arizona, so Mexican food in the Cleveland area has generally been disappointing but El Rodeo is a place that I actually enjoy to go. The portions are very large and cooked well. As was noted in the other review, on the nights that the Mariachis are playing, it can get very loud but if you go on those nights, you are kind of asking for it. I actually quite enjoyed the music and my children were very entertained by it.

The atmosphere is bright and typical of what you'd see at any mexican place but I personally think it is cleaner and better taken care of than most. 

If you feel the craving for Mexican food in Cleveland, this is one of the few places that I would recommend (including the upscale ones).",1

For dinner I had a dish I can't remember the name of -- it was essentially a hash of steak, chorizo, onions, and cilantro. The name may not be memorable, but the dish was: a fantastic combination of flavors, not too spicy, served in a sizzling rock bowl. 

I was a bit disappointed, though, to see such an Americanized menu from a place that appeared at first glance to be perhaps a bit more authentic than most. I think Cleveland is ready for real Mexican food; Chi-Chi's is long gone, Momocho is hip, and the time is right for a blue-collar Mexican joint that transcends the traditional combination-plate Amerimex fare.

Don't get me wrong, El Rodeo does a fine job. I'm just ready for more!",1
J1RDyyPxhioqm8c_fi4P4Q,"Simply put... with so many reviews I'll give a bullet point approach. 
- Great location 
- Fun and authentic staff
- Creative yet down to earth eating
- Fabulous tastes and combination with tremendous balance
- Simple and relaxing atmosphere/decor

Summary, this Michael Symon establishment speaks right to the dream of Cleveland. Friendly, Un-pretentious, Ethnic, Flavorful, Simple, Cost effective, Food basket of the country that dreams of shedding the ""underdog"" assumptions. 
While I travel around the world, this place is my favorite place to eat anywhere.... that says a lot. 

My favorite experience here, was to let our server who was quite candor at first to choose the cocktails for my friends wife and my wife. (let's see if he has any skill) He looked at them for a moment, made his estimations and brought them two drinks... to our amazement he completely embodied their personality in the selection he brought to each of them. 
We laughed and agreed this guy, kicks a**. 
Thanks Lola for keeping it real...",1
J1RDyyPxhioqm8c_fi4P4Q,This review is long over due. Myself and three others dined here. This is THE fine dining establishment to try if you are visiting Cleveland from out of town and want an authentic culinary experience. I had booked the chefs table months in advance. The dinner itself consisted of 8 courses along with wine pairings. Each individual had their own server and the chef came out to explain each dish. This was one of the best meals I have ever had. Thank you so much to the staff at Lola for making such a memorable experience reality.,1
J1RDyyPxhioqm8c_fi4P4Q,"Isn't it great to get what you want?

We had had a great visit so far: lots of home-cooked food, plenty of time to chat with family and play with nieces and nephews. But after supervising the umpteenth art project, we wanted to enjoy a nice meal in a restaurant with a hang-out-a-while atmosphere. 

So we snagged a late reservation at Lola. It was outstanding!  Both appetizers and three of four entrees were flawless -- much love especially for the trout and the duck confit.

What strikes me most is that we spent the entire evening pleasantly engaged with our dining experience. So many times, I eat at one restaurant and talk about other food during the meal. Here, though, we were only talking about what was or would soon be in front of us.

Two last points: 1) wonderful service; 2) the pastry chef is the supreme master of playful deliciousness.",1
J-3u7M186SmAoC1l0ViEFw,"The sandwiches are never good, they are always sort of bland. They should offer cheez wiz for the authentic cheesesteak experience. The lemonade is good though. The fries are greasy and boring.  Not sure why this place gets so much praise.",0
j4170xdQJTwSvXFpsQzWtg,"This place is clean, authentic, and upbeat. Public parking is in the back.

I wanted to love it, but at the end of the day I think I thought the food was just ok. I needed a bit more zip.",0
j4170xdQJTwSvXFpsQzWtg,"Yeah the menu is pretty authentic but I went there close to the end of their shift (7pm) and the food was not that fresh. Aside from the french fries and the tostones the chicken was pretty dry and warm. Some items on the menu were not available anymore at 6pm.

I will go back for sure, but perhaps at the lunch time for a better experience.

I asked why they close at 7pm and they said it is because of security. Guess that neighborhood is not too safe!

The flan was absolutely outstanding!",0
j4170xdQJTwSvXFpsQzWtg,"You want authentic Puerto Rican cuisine, jibarro meals that's real close to abuela's cooking? This is THE PLACE! The whole menu just teases those who are familiar with Caribbean cooking at its best! The food reminds me of grandmas meals that were prepared with love and care which made them that more enjoyable!  I can't say enough great things about this place, so I suggest that you just come in and experience the food for yourself!! Take a break from your day and make a break for the islands!",1
j4170xdQJTwSvXFpsQzWtg,"After the ownership changed the quality of this place all around slightly went down. It is authentic and good food but, it was alot better before the trade. Same prices, slight degradation of food quality.",0
j4170xdQJTwSvXFpsQzWtg,Great authentic Puerto Rican food! I highly recommend the empanadillas and the sweet plantains. Also the pork chops are very good.,1
j4170xdQJTwSvXFpsQzWtg,I love this place. I've been coming here for almost 2 years. Never have gotten a bad dish. I grew up eating authentic Puerto Rican food and their pork skins are closest i found since i moved to Cleveland.  They also have huge cuban sandwiches. Empanadas yummy and ready to order!! Should get some to take home.,1
j4170xdQJTwSvXFpsQzWtg,"The best! Their food is amazing! The only thing that sucks is they close at 7, not open on Sunday and they run out of chicken a lot but overall the place is authentic and awesome.",1
j4170xdQJTwSvXFpsQzWtg,"Delicious, authentic food, super friendly waitstaff, really good vibes inside!",1
j4170xdQJTwSvXFpsQzWtg,"So it's probably been over 10 years since I've been here. Food is just as great as I remember it. One of the, if not the, best authentic Puerto Rican food in Cleveland. LOVE their chicharrones - my favorite! So crispy and tasty! Had the chicharrones as appetizer and got the Latin style steak platter for my meal. Wife got the pork mofongo and kids go sandwiches. Awesome! I'd give the food a full 5-stars

So why a 3-star review? Service was sub-par. We came on a Saturday afternoon and saw that there was a bit of a line when we walked in. When I asked how long the wait would be for a party of 6, I was told about 15-20 minutes. Not bad! So we put our name down. It ended up taking more like 50 minutes for us to get seated. No one even bothered to update us until about 5 minutes before our table was ready. And when we were finally seated, it took another 15 mins for a server to come to our table. I don't mind waiting, but don't severely over promise on your wait estimate. After we all placed our orders, our food all came out at different times. 

Overall, great food, so I'm sure we'll be back again. But we may consider take out, instead.",0
j4170xdQJTwSvXFpsQzWtg,"Today was my first time at this amazing place! I have always heard great things about it and a lot of my friends go often. It's a shame that it took me so long to go considering I drive past all the time! 

The food was AMAZING! If you like authentic Spanish food then this place is for you. I had fried chicken with rice and beans and my boyfriend had the same but the roasted chicken. I have always lived Spanish rice and beans but this place takes the trophy...possibly the best I have ever had. The chicken was very good too. Next time I go I want to the crispy pork....it looked soooo good.

You know it's gotta be good food when every single person in the restaurant is Latino! 

We will definitely be back!",1
j4170xdQJTwSvXFpsQzWtg,"This place is authentic and quite honestly once I got the menu I was happy that being Friday they had additional "" weekend options"". I settled on trying the appetizers of chicharones which is basically fried pork skin. There was a lot of meat on the appetizer and it was delicious even my hubby who dissects all fat that can be seen really enjoyed the appetizer. I ordered a side of tostones also known as fried plantains. They do not salt them but there's salt table side that did the job. I ordered the Cubano sandwich which was delicious! I couldn't finish it! I tried some of hubbys steak with onions and rice and beans they substituted the yellow rice instead of white on the menu it's number one. Literally the number 1 option with a photo. He was happy as the steak was NOT chewy which he was worried about and was really nicely seasoned! I had to order the flan because well it's a Puerto Rican restaurant and they should have kick ass flan.  The menu prices are affordable the portions very generous if I lived close by I'd be fat because it's so damn good! So do your self a favor come try this place. You won't be disappointed! I parked off a side street to avoid paying the meter. It is nice atmosphere definitely family fun business but very clean and great service. They are open on Fridays I called because Yelp had listed them as closed today but the sign photo showed open on Friday. Flan is perfect! It's so excellent! I'd definitely be overweight if I lived close by it's worth a drive to eat here. Check them out! You won't be disappointed!",1
j4170xdQJTwSvXFpsQzWtg,"I am a big fan of Puerto Rican food, and was happy to find this place.  It seems authentic, and our waitress was very nice and helpful.  However, the food was much greasier and saltier than it needed to be.  Also, my husband finished his entree before mine was brought out, and our appetizer came out even later.  The menu is somewhat confusing because certain dishes are listed more than once in different categories.  We won't return.",0
j4170xdQJTwSvXFpsQzWtg,"We were in the area and happened to see this little restaurant and decide to stop. My husband is Puerto Rican (born and raised there) so I knew he would be a good critic. 

The place has an authentic look and the food was good, just like the hubs said you would have at someone's house in Puerto Rico.

The alcapurria (fried banana meat thingie) he had took him right back to his childhood. The owner/waitress was super nice--she spoke English but we spoke to her in Spanish.

For vegetarians, the yellow rice and beans are a good option, as well as the tostones. They don't use any meat products in their beans which is nice.

Can't wait to go back!",1
j4170xdQJTwSvXFpsQzWtg,"Really authentic home style meals in a low key location. Chicharrones are good, and definitely don't skip the yellow rice and beans. Great spot for take out or a filling lunch.",1
j4170xdQJTwSvXFpsQzWtg,"We spent a quiet Dyngus Day (look it up) here at Rincon Criollo. It was clean, small, and authentic. 

I was happy to find jibaritos on the menu (first invented in Chicago at Borinquen) which are these delicious steak sandwiches w/ garlic mayo wedged in between two slices of fried plantains. Mmm.

The plus: $5.50 jibaritos! These sandwiches are huge--maybe 8 or 10 inches?

I had the beef stew with beans and rice. The beef was pretty tender; rice and beans fairly standard. We also had the half moon chicken empanadilla which was very tasty. 

Service was friendly, but I wished they would intuitively think of the customer's needs.",1
j4170xdQJTwSvXFpsQzWtg,"I enjoy the authenticity of the food , it just taste so dang good. It get a bit crowded , but if you have the time , it is definitely worth the wait. Waitresses are friendly and attentive.",1
J4jxIxv_vgmWHCajos_B8w,Had lunch here yesterday and the food was wonderful. It was expertly prepared with very authentic flavors and sauces. The wait staff were wonderful and the atmosphere is lush and ornate. Highly recommend.,1
J4jxIxv_vgmWHCajos_B8w,"LOVED Taza! Our guests were big fans of Lebanese food after traveling abroad, and were so impressed with the authenticity of their dishes. We tried an assortment of mezze plates to try, and my favorite by far was the baba ghanoush. Their pita was so warm fluffy and delicious. One plate was a mixed meat platter, and everything was fabulous. I highly recommend going with a group and ordering a bit of everything! The only dish I did not care for was the tabbouleh, but only because it had lots of parsley, which I make mine without.",1
J4jxIxv_vgmWHCajos_B8w,"Great place for authentic Lebanese food!  If you are planning a large event, the private room is super cool.  We had a group of 16 and the service was great. Definitely give this place a try!  Also, check in on yelp for free baklava!",1
J4jxIxv_vgmWHCajos_B8w,"We decided to go outside our comfort zone and stop here for lunch. My review is based on the fact that we have probably had true Lebanese food once or twice in our lives, and it was given to us by the Lebanese girl dating our son, so it was homemade and dessert, at that. If you aren't Lebanese, I'll try to explain what we experienced so your taste buds will be alerted. If you are, pardon me if I get any of the spices or seasonings wrong.

Firstly, ""free"" weekend parking in the area is hit or miss. We were there on a Saturday at lunch time and had to circle to actually see someone leaving within 2 blocks of the place. Good luck with that.

Secondly, when we entered, no one came to seat us. We stood in the foyer for a good 4-5 minutes waiting. It wasn't until my husband actually walked into the dining area that the waitress saw us and came over. 

We were seated pleasantly enough, and we were brought a basket of flat breads with olive oil that appeared to have a very mild black pepper as well as sesame seeds in it. I'm not a fan of olive oil. I don't do bitters very well, and olive oil sets that off for me in a very unpleasant way. The husband enjoys bitters and he was the one doing all the dipping. 

We both got unsweetened iced tea, the regular kind, though they have different flavors. No sweeteners were volunteered, so after 20 minutes or so, I had to ask.

We ordered the shawarma for an appetizer, and then I got the kebab pita and the husband got the lamb pita. 

The shawarma was different for a non-Mediterranean person. It had peppers and onions on the plate, sauteed in olive oil, but then it also had a chopped/diced meat, almost like minute steaks cut up, in olive oil and some bitter seasoning I couldn't place. It wasn't lemon, it wasn't citrus at all, but definitely very bitter. The back sides of my tongue are bothering me now as I type this in memory. The husband ate more of it than I did and seemed to like it. 

When the meals came, we had a sandwich which was grilled on the outside then cut in half, and fries with an ""ancient"" seasoning on them. I personally didn't know that French Fries existed in ancient times, nor that the Lebanese had a special seasoning for them back then, but ok. Whatever. They weren't bad. Just different. 

The husband enjoyed his sandwich, but after the first half, was full, so he disassembled it and ate the veggies he knew and the remaining lamb chunks. He wasn't a fan of the pickled turnips. I know that much.

I, on the other hand, was having a heck of a time with my kebab pita. In each side, there were 3 chunks of meat, about the size of a standard ice cub. That would have been fine except it was the toughest meat I've eaten in a long time. On top of that, it was very sinewy and hard to bite into without grabbing the entire chunk and looking extremely uncouth. So I had to hold the sandwich to my face and chew - chew - chew - chew until I could actually bite through the gristle and sinew. Again, the meat was bitter tasting, like the shawarma, and on top of the pickled turnip, some bitter greens inside and a slightly sour sauce, it was too much for me. I put the sandwich down and picked through the rest, eating small bites until it was time to go. 

The husband enjoys bitter, like I said, but by the time we were hitting the french fries, he had admitted it was enough for him in one sitting, too.

So we paid the bill and headed out. 

Now, truly, I don't know the culture very well, as the girl who was dating our son remained very removed from us for almost the 4 years they were together as she lived 1200 miles away with him, so I can't say whether it was authentic food or whether it was just restaurant food. It was good. It was fresh. It was very flavorful (especially if you enjoy the bitters) and we did enjoy what we had. The waitress and hostess (?) were very attentive once we were seated and catered to our needs very well. However, that said, I wouldn't go back. It was one of those ""did it, moving on"" type experiences for me, and didn't have enough draw there to call me back for a second time around.",0
J4jxIxv_vgmWHCajos_B8w,"Love this place. I've probably been here 7 times now, and I have been living in Cleveland for 11 months. So authentic and so tasty. You MUST get the Lebanese jibneh for an app.",1
J4jxIxv_vgmWHCajos_B8w,"Let's start with the bad: the sangria wasn't very good.  But I feel like that was our fault for ordering sangria at a Lebanese restaurant.  Honestly, in retrospect, I feel silly about the whole thing.  End of list.

Onto the good things: first, as other reviewers have mentioned, if you can sit at one of Clair's tables, do it.  She's fantastic at her job not only as a waitress but as an ambassador for the restaurant and the cuisine it serves.  Second, the location and atmosphere is pretty great.  Sitting outside on a nice evening or at the bar on a not-nice evening provides pleasant surroundings and an oasis of authenticity in what can sometimes be a desert of douchey vibes up and down W 6th St.  Third, get the jibneh.  It's listed as an appetizer, but it really should be in a separate category as some kind of cheese course (and I could see having it at any time during a meal--first, as a side, as an intermezzo course, even as a savory dessert).  You get 4 pieces of delicious Lebanese cheese in a pomegranate sauce with...well, you can read a menu, but thanks to Clair's guidance, I ordered the right thing and was not disappointed.  Next time I'm in the neighborhood on a summer night, I'm definitely stopping off for a beer and some cheese.",1
J4jxIxv_vgmWHCajos_B8w,"I asked the server what was the most authentic item or items on the menu. She was helpful and pointed out that only a few were NOT instead of the other way around. We ordered a few appetizers to share as a meal. Three were plenty as a meal! Since I have no way to assess the authenticity, I can only rate by the flavors. All three dishes were quite tasty but the chicken was over cooked and dry. Still, the combinations were nice. Worth a second visit if I'm in the area again.",1
J4jxIxv_vgmWHCajos_B8w,"Best authentic Lebanese food. Friendly environment and great service. Their beef shawarma is a must try. 
5 stars !",1
J4jxIxv_vgmWHCajos_B8w,"The food was amazing! We ordered the hummus and falafel appetizers. I then had the Shwarama Fettah plate. The pita chips in it were fresh and authentic like the rest of the food. This place far exceeded my expectaions. After having been to Israel, I have had a hard time finding Mediterranean places that compare. 

Our waitress was also awesome! Her name is Taylor. She is sweet and funny. It is hard to find a server with such a great personality.",1
J4jxIxv_vgmWHCajos_B8w,"I travel quite a bit for work and have been to this restaurant twice now. I've always recieved top notch service, and the ambiance is very upscale while remaining authentic. The food is amazing as well. What really stood out is that there was a scheduled private event an hour from when I walked in they were srambling, but the owner graciously allowed me in and never made me felt rushed through my meal.",1
J4jxIxv_vgmWHCajos_B8w,This restaurant is hands down the best Lebanese restaurant I have ever been to. But to be fair it's the only Lebanese restaurant I've ever been to. The service was amazing. My group got the nicest waitress named Janet. The food was exquisite and authentic. The whole restaurant made me feel comfortable and I can't wait till the next time I roll back to Cleveland to eat here again.,1
J4jxIxv_vgmWHCajos_B8w,"A wonderful find in Cleveland!!! As a former New Yorkers relocated to the CLE for work, it was great to find some authentic cultural culinary variety. 

Highly recommend the spicy hummus, falafel and fatteh. All very delicious and fresh. The restaurant is also dog friendly in the outdoor seating area which is an added bonus. Wine selection was also on par",1

J4jxIxv_vgmWHCajos_B8w,"The food was amazing authentic Lebanese food. The service was great. Our server Claire was so awesome. She was so insightful into Lebanese food for a novice, like myself. Our company lives in Chicago and has tried some great Lebanese food but said that Taza had the best seasoning and the lamb was cooked to perfection. This place had it all great service and beautiful atmosphere but most importantly awesome food!",1
J4jxIxv_vgmWHCajos_B8w,"Mediocre middle Eastern food - at least from the perspective of an L.A. foodie. Yes, it was not bad but failed to elicit any excitement beyond the usual expectations. The pita bread was great, the humus average, the meat  (lamb kebob) solid - I mean really solid!! Hard to distinguish in consistency from the underlying plate. Really inferior in my opinion was the fact that the desserts had NO pride in offering anything authentic middle Eastern (and I know there would/could be fabulous desserts), but what they offered was 0815 and could just as well have been obtained in a McDonald's.",0
J4jxIxv_vgmWHCajos_B8w,Great food and great people. It has a very authentic feel and the food is fresh. Highly recommend!,1
J4jxIxv_vgmWHCajos_B8w,"Okay I'm not from Cleveland I was visiting from Brooklyn where there are dozens of authentic, fantastic Middle Eastern restaurants so maybe I've been spoiled. But this was truly horrible. I ordered a shawarma and was given a plate of greasy ground chuck. I explained that I had ordered Shawarma and was told ""this is our version"". That's like ordering a pork chop and being given a hot dog and told ""this is our version"". Gross.",0
J4jxIxv_vgmWHCajos_B8w,"Very authentic the owner is first generation Lebanese.
The food was beyond Standard it was excellent.
This has only been three time eating Lebanese because last time the hummus  was dry. I highly recommend it",1

J4jxIxv_vgmWHCajos_B8w,"Clair was just as FANTASTIC as the amazing food and experience at Taza! Great family atmosphere and service combined with authentic Lebanese cuisine. Our 9 and 11 year olds loved their decently priced options from the kids menu. Mom, Dad and Grandma enjoyed Lebanese beer and wine blends! Clevelandites- check it out!",1
J4jxIxv_vgmWHCajos_B8w,"Wonderful place for a real authentic middle eastern delightful food.
A must see in Cleveland",1
J4jxIxv_vgmWHCajos_B8w,"We made a reservation since we had a large group but when we walked in, it wasn't too packed, yet our service was somewhat slow. We were in town celebrating a wedding so we wanted to get drinks but it took a while to get the bottles of wine we ordered. Girls in my party started order double to offset the wait. The food was delicious though! We all ordered a variety of entrees and everyone loved their meal. I was thrilled to find out that my check in with Yelp had a free Turkish coffee and baklava. We were all so stuffed after dinner! I've never had authentic Lebanese food so I can't compare but this was amazing!",1
J4jxIxv_vgmWHCajos_B8w,"Awesome food! Was glad I visited this place during my visit to Cleveland, OH. I had shish lamb, Turkish coffee and baklava along with fresh bread. The lamb was tender and juicy and had authentic flavor to it, although I felt the meat portion was a little less for the meal. The staff was nice and friendly. I recommend this place to anyone who likes Mediterranean cuisine. I will surely come back.",1
J4jxIxv_vgmWHCajos_B8w,"This place was really cozy, authentic and fun. I really liked the food. The food was incredibly flavorful. The menu literally had everything you could ever want for Lebanese.

j9cVHTAIkliYQp4XoVcsnQ,"Friday night - 7PM, place is half empty - clue #1.   Just wanted a quick dinner as we had to get to the airport to pick up relatives.   Decided on onion soup and a chicken curry pasty.    The onion soup was microwaved for sure!   The broth was so hot, we had to wait ten minutes to eat it.  By then, the crusty bread that was supposed to be inside was a lump of soggy paste.   The melted cheese was not browned in the oven like it should be.  it was DEFINITELY melted via the microwave - clue #2.    The pasty was not fresh.   The crush was floppy (again warmed in the microwave), and it had a hint of refrigerator taste.   I ate the inside of mine as I was starving but my husband barely touched his.  Strike - #3.   When we asked the waitress about it she said they are not made fresh every day, i.e. they are made about twice a week.  I mentioned that we expect our food to be fresh and she said she would tell someone.  She came back with the bill and there was no discount offered.  We asked her why and she disappeared.  10 minutes later, a man who we assume is the manager, stopped by with no expression of regret and just handed us the bill saying ""here you go""!  They took 50% off of the pasty which is fine, since I had eaten some of mine, but he should have spent time with us trying to understand why we were unhappy.  We will NOT be back and I warn you that unless you want to drink in a somewhat authentic looking English pub, there are so many other choices nearby.    The place is not pricey but that is no excuse for cooking in a microwave.",0
ja7zjowr6ymsVglQXZZ6BA,"Very fast delivery to Ohio City.  The food is good. Not terrific, probably not extremely authentic, but good and cheap.  

I definitely recommend the Crab Rangoons. The won-ton soup was great too.  The ginger chicken had celery in it - which I HATE - so I won't order that again, but that's just personal preference.  

Will definitely order from this place again when I'm in the mood for some cheap Chinese takeout.",1
ja7zjowr6ymsVglQXZZ6BA,"Couldn't help but feel pretty icky while I ate.
The restaurant still has dusty Christmas decorations up....it's January 26th
The food isn't really authentic, spicy or tasty by any means. The dessert table is a joke. 
The service was decent.",0
ja7zjowr6ymsVglQXZZ6BA,"I recently came here one afternoon for lunch and gotten takeout. They had the buffet selection which expected to be ""ok"" food. Their selection was low for a buffet, I then tried some of the food and it was bland. Had to add some seasoning to make it more edible. 

Overall, would come back again if I am really desperate for fast food Chinese food. But I would just go down the street to Chinatown to get better food, authentic or Americanize Chinese food.",0
J-c9f_geQDMcNiZSjJDDYw,"I have been eating here for 15 years. It has consistently offered yummy and authentic Thai/Cambodian/Khmer food. They make the beast Pad Thai in Cleveland, hands down. The curries are good, the jade noodles, the soups, the spring rolls and Mango with sticky rice all great. Tonight I picked up a Green Papaya salad and, for the first time, was a bit disappointed. In fact, it had so much raw garlic (which I believe one can never have too much of) that I could not eat it. I'll try again tomorrow, but that's a salad that really bites back. I also got the Mekong Garden, a vegetable and tofu medley topped with a peanut sauce. Nice, the vegetables were perfectly cooked,. but the sauce was a bit sweet for me. 

Yum! Pad Thai! And did I mention the portions are HUGE?",1
J-c9f_geQDMcNiZSjJDDYw,"Like a reviewer said before me, the more popular Lemongrass (located in the old McDonald's building on Lee) truly pales in comparison.

Here it is not only authentic, but the menu is extraordinary in size and quality. Try the samlaw machu kati....your choice of meat with eggplant and peppers in a savory green tamarind curry. This place has the usual red, green and yellow curries, but it has both thai and cambodian sauces as well, all made by the family that runs the place. They have pad thai (excellent!) but also have many other pasta choices.

It is quiet and a good place to take a date or your family. Be adventurous....order a dish you've never tried and you will be back to do it again.",1
J-c9f_geQDMcNiZSjJDDYw,"good authentic food, huge menu, good service. great for Thai or Cambodian. the food  can get pretty spicy so be careful when ordering. they use a scale of 1-10 for spiciness i think  I ordered a 8 once and it was way too spicy and i really like spicy.",1
J-c9f_geQDMcNiZSjJDDYw,"I'll start with the good. The service was top notch the two times I've been here. Very well-mannered, attentive, fast, and they know their way around the menu. Good enough for me to bump the rating to 3 stars from 2.

Now for the not so good. The first time I came here I decided to pop my Khmer cherry. I asked our waiter for a recommendation and he pointed out two dishes I can't remember the name of (or chose to forget). They were both ""samlaw"" dishes... curries with a variety of veggies in a tangy brownish green sauce. I have a fearless appetite and can devour almost anything anyone throws at me, even the most authentic, stinky, unappealing dish that exists... but these were two dishes I just could not gulp down. The brownish green poo-water appearance didn't phase me. It was the funky smell and taste. I ate enough to curb my appetite and got a to-go box for the rest, which I ended up tossing. 

On my second visit I got their pad thai, which everyone seems to rave about and claim as east side's best. Eh. To their credit, it's probably the hugest portion I've seen anywhere, and I know you read that everywhere, but here it's actually true. It was ENORMOUS. Still though, that wasn't enough to make up for its shortcomings: very little meat, too many bean sprouts, and not enough flavor. Bangkok Thai still claims the title as east side's best.

So yeah... impressions are not so great. I can't really hold the funky samlaw dishes against them because maybe it just wasn't my kinda thing. I am determined find a Khmer dish that I like, so I may return eventually.",0
J-c9f_geQDMcNiZSjJDDYw,"I'll start by saying what this place is not: pretentious, too chic for you, expensive.  Rather this place is everything that is good about Cambodia, especially when you compare it to Thailand: it's down-to-earth, authentic, AND family-friendly.  I went there with a group (and one baby) and every single person enjoyed their dish.  

I got the spicy squid (there is also a Thai version of this dish) and I enjoyed it tremendously.  It was spicy enough (hard to find in the U.S.) and also not over-cooked (very easy to do with squid). My husband had the curry beef and he enjoyed his dish as well.  How do I sum up this restaurant?  It's not really a place you would want to take a first date to, instead, it's where you take that very special lady that you've been on many many dates with (and maybe have a baby with) and you two order something that you know the other person will want a taste of.  We've already been here twice in one month!

Side-note:  We loved our waiter!  He's this punk Cambodian kid with cool tattoos who sounds a little like Keanu Reeves.  What's not to love? :)",1
J-c9f_geQDMcNiZSjJDDYw,"the food at this restaurant is authentic, and delicious, more than i can say for some other neighborhood favorites.
what this restaurant lacks is atmosphere. it is gloomy and uncomfortably cold. there is nothing worse than having to eat dinner with your coat on.
so, i don't eat here as often as i would like, i  do take out.",0
J-c9f_geQDMcNiZSjJDDYw,"I recently moved to the area from the San Francisco bay area where Thai and Cambodian restaurants are very common due to large communities of immigrants from those countries.  Therefore, I have been able to sample many throughout my lifetime and find some of the best the country has to offer.  Also, having eaten at the Lotus of Siam in Las Vegas, which is often regarded as the best Thai in the country including their secret North Thai menu.  

The Mekong River Restaurant is one of the best places I have had these cuisines at.  They make legitimate Thai and Cambodian dishes and will make it properly hot if you ask.

I'm not sure what sort of background the rest of the reviewers have, but it seems they are looking for the very Americanized style of large portions and bland flavors - they should stick to Stouffers.

Since Cleveland is being regarded now as an upcoming ""foodie town,"" if you truly want to expand your palate, you should try this place.

Also, take the owner's recommendations for authentic Cambodian dishes.  He recommended the Samlaw Machu Kahti (no oil) with beef, and I could actually taste each ingredient even though there are 12.  I also had their Green Curry and it was delicious as well.

If you haven't had this type of food before, I would start with the Pad Thai, but you have to go beyond that because it is a pretty novice dish.

Their website is actually:

Also, it seems they have remodeled since the ""dirty"" reviews.  It was actually pretty pleasant inside.",1
J-c9f_geQDMcNiZSjJDDYw,"I never noticed the restaurant until a friend recommended coming here for dinner one night. I go down Lee road all the time, but somehow kept missing this place...silly me. 

I've eaten here twice so far, and had good food both times. Sometimes with Asian restaurants you worry whether they serve authentic Asian cuisine, or a more Americanized ""fusion"" version of Asian food. Luckily, this place serves the former rather than the latter. 

I came here both times with a group of friends. Their menu is quite big, so there are plenty of dishes to choose from. Some of my friends are vegetarian, and it's great to see a good number of options for them besides the typical salad! The servers are very nice, and if you have any questions about any of the dishes they are more than happy to answer them. I couldn't make up my mind about which dish I wanted this time around, fortunately, our server was kind enough to list some recommendations for me to try. We ordered the following: papaya salad (this has a good kick to it!), veggie rolls, seafood dynasty, samlaw korko- tofu (#61), samlaw machu kahti- tofu (#64), mi chha noodles- shrimp, veggie pad thai, and two soups- tom yum goong and mekong soup. We tried each others' dish, which is the great thing about dining out with a group of friends! My favorite was the samlaw korko! The sauce was delicious with zucchini and rice. With southeast Asian cuisine, it's a great mix of sour, sweet, citrusy, salty, and spicy  foods. They often use pungent fish oil, shrimp paste, garlic, and ginger etc. to make their delicious dishes...and I must say I love every bit of it! This place is worth a try if you haven't been here already! Warning, the portions are pretty big, so remember to share...sharing is caring!",1
J-c9f_geQDMcNiZSjJDDYw,"4 stars for our first visit to this hole-in-the-wall restaurant!

Mekong River was recommended to us by a friend who is Cambodian as one of the areas best Cambodian restaurants. Though I live really close to Mekong River, I've always been a little skeptical of it as a suburban, Americanized Asian restaurant. It turned out to be really good!

We asked the waiter what he would recommend as authentic Cambodian food, and he mentioned #59, Chha Kreoung. He also mentioned #63 and #64, Samlaw Machu Kreoung and Samlaw Machu Kahti as close favorites that had really good flavor. We ended up going with #59 Chha Kreoung with shrimp and tofu. The flavors were really good - sweet, sour, and spicy with plenty of basil, and the spices were right on. (The beau used to live in the Bay Area and ate regularly at a Cambodian restaurant.)

We also got the Cambodian Curry with tofu. I really enjoyed this one. It was more on the sweeter side and had lots of veggies - potatoes, yams, green peppers, onions, etc in a really good peanut curry sauce. Yum.

The portions were pretty big, and so we had lots of leftovers! Good stuff. We will be back.",1
JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g,Amazing place. Wonderful for a romantic dinner. Try their crÁEªpes! Very authentic and fresh French food.,1
JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g,"I was immediately charmed by Le Petite - it's a very cozy (read: small) cafe with an open kitchen and lovely patio.  The service is warm and friendly. The atmosphere feels very authentic and the menu is divine.  My friends and I had a hard time choosing what to order.

The best parts were the drinks - fernet and espresso (from local roasters Rising Star) and bellinis.  Le Petite boasts an impressive drink list - my friend is a national beverage director and he was very happy with the offerings.

We tried: cheese plate, French onion soup, and 2 savory crepes.  The food was pretty good overall.  Next time, I'm going to splurge on a croissant sandwich with eggs, jambon, and brie cheese with a side of potatoes.",1
JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g,"This place is awesome: food=excellent, decor=authentic, and waitresses=genuinely nice. I highly recommend spending lots of time in Ohio city and this place in particular. 


I'm still amazed that you can get crepes in Cleveland!",1
JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g,"A friend recommended this place to me since I used to live in France. Usually, I take these recommendations with a grain of salt, but I have to say, Le Petit has done a good job creating a mostly-authentic French restaurant. The atmosphere is very cute, and overall the food is great and the wait staff is really friendly, but a smidge slow.

I particularly enjoyed the pork shoulder and my friends all really enjoyed the quiche. Their crepes are also great! I would definitely recommend this to anyone.",1
JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g,"This is an adorable spot to get breakfast, brunch, or lunch with your family or gal pals! I love the ambience (feels very authentic), the giant jars of nutella, and tons of options. If you love crepes, this is your Cleveland go-to. Cute decor, too.",1
JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g,Tried this with a group for my high school. The food tasted as authentic as a girl going to a sperm bank to experience sex. It just isn't accurate.,0
JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g,"SUMMARY:  Food was ok; service was iffy.  Not a place I'm running back to.

FULL STORY:  Came here for lunch with a friend recently.  The place is small -- maybe 12 or so tables.  I guess the atmosphere fits with the neighborhood cafe idea... it's definitely an old building with tight seating, so I would come in expecting that.

It didn't seem busy the day we went -- there were 4 other occupied tables.  Our orders were simple -- a salad and a crepe...  but it took over 20 minutes for drinks and almost 45 minutes for any food, without an update.  That was surprising given the staff-to-customer ratio that afternoon.  

I thought the food was alright... nothing bad, but nothing outstanding.  I was at least expecting some great bread, but it seemed pretty average.  The coffee was good (Rising Star apparently)!

What detracted most from the experience was the negative attitude from staff members... it came off kind of passive-aggressive for no clear reason, which hasn't been typical of my experience at other local restaurants around Cleveland.  That was a bummer.

If you're ever around DC and love French food, check out Bistrot du Coin!  That place is amazing and very authentic!  

Note: street parking",0
JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g,"Fell in love with this place the first time I walked in. I went back last night around 8pm with a great friend and we had an amazing dinner. 

This petit french cafe is one-of-a-kind here in Cleveland. A great date-spot with amazing food and the most authentically french menu I've seen since moving back from New York. The ambiance is cozy, francais, cafe with seating for about 20 in the main dining room. There is also a banquet area in the back. The kitchen is open and right in front of you as you walk through the door! The chef and hostess are incredibly friendly, giving the cafe a neighborly feel to it. Soft cafe jazz plays in the background, with some french folk tunes accompanying. 

Food-wise, absolutely delicious. I had braised lamb shank, she had escargos' and frommage bleu salad. We ended with creme brulee and bananas foster. I accompanied my meal with a delicious treat, leftover Christmas Ale that was hiding in the cooler. She had a delicious Hot Rum Apple Cider. If you can't decide what to eat, go with a crepe, any crepe will do. They are all incredibly delicious.

We were the only two in the restaurant for a while. Single patrons came in for a quick dinner and drink sporadically throughout the night. 

I HIGHLY recommend Le Petit for any kind of cozy time with amazing food and equally amazing service.",1
JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g,"This place is so cute. I stumbled in for the first time on a very snowy Sunday morning, and this was like a tiny little cozy French haven. Everything you would expect from a great French cafe/bistro: great coffee, salads, CREPES, and other fun, well-executed dishes. I appreciate that the food is pretty authentic, and everything I've ever tried has been just right. 

For dessert, the Nutella crepe with strawberries and bananas is a must.",1
JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g,"I think I'm in love with this place.  Everything about it is absolutely adorable.  The cozy interior, the open kitchen, the cute little patio, the friendly servers...I don't know why I haven't been here before now, but I regret that so much time passed.  I had the Ratatouille Crepe with buckwheat flower and a side of roasted potatoes, both of which were absolutely delicious.  The flavors in the crepe were perfectly balanced and nothing overwhelmed or overpowered anything else.  There was sauce on top but it wasn't soupy or overwhelming.  I don't remember the French name, but my friend got the ham and cheese sandwich and was also very happy with his choice.  

There's also a fantastic cocktail menu with ample choices.  I started with the St. Germain and Champagne cocktail which was delicious (and I don't even care for champagne all that much, but I wanted to try something different) and also got a glass of the Sangria, which was phenomenal as well.  

Without the drinks, the crepe and the side of potatoes were only $12, so not bad considering the decent portion size.  Don't expect leftovers, but I didn't feel like I gorged either.  It was just the right size.    

I'll be honest and say that I'm not at all familiar with French food so I can't speak to it's authenticity.  But regardless, if you like tasty food in general this place is definitely worth checking out.  The only warning is that it's on the small side, so I'd make reservations if you're going to go on a weekend.  I'll definitely be back!",1

Called ahead the day of to get a reservation for early afternoon (about 2-3pm on a Sunday), our table was ready when we arrived. Service was good - one friend misunderstood the menu and mistakenly ordered something she didn't like (eyeroll). They brought her a new dish free of charge. We had a french press coffee pot for the table that was promptly refilled. Everyone was very pleased with their meals -soup, salad, and croque monsieurs were ordered. I had the croque madame (a croque monsieur with an egg on top). I spent a summer in France and had these several times a week, my favorite! I was very pleased with the quality and authentic taste. Delicious and perfectly filling. Served with a side of potatoes. I also had to get a crepe! I chose the lemon curd and it was amazing. The curd was perfectly tart and not too sweet. Great brunch experience here, my new favorite breakfast spot in the city!",1
JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g,"Absolutely one of my favorite restaurants in all of Cleveland. The food is authentic, delicious, and fresh - you can see the chef right when you walk in the front door preparing food. This place somehow manages to feel fancy and relaxed at the same time - you can show up in jeans or a ball gown and feel comfortable in either one. 

I ordered the smoked trout and lentil salad which is easily a 10/10. I've had other dishes here as well I'd rate just as high.

Everyone here is friendly and genuinely wants you to relax and enjoy a lovely meal.",1

They change their menu seasonally, so there's always something new to try which keeps you coming back. This is the perfect place in the summer for a nice outdoor brunch under the shady awnings.",1
JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g,"I had a lovely time at my recent trip to Le Petit.

To begin, I don't like pumpkin stuff, like, usually ever. But the gal sold me on their pumpkin steamer, which was made with their homemade pumpkin base. It was delicioussss. Not super sugary, and came served in this huge cup and saucer. It made me so happy. I would come back for that alone.

I also had the chicken croissant and hopped on their wi-fi to do a little work. Le Petit is as close to an authentic Parisian cafe as Cleveland will ever get. The menu is creative and inspired and the interior reminds me of a street French bistro. The service is a bit slow, but I think its because its more of a neighborhood gathering spot. The service is interlaced with a lot of talking and hanging out, with a lot of folks who seem like regulars. I can see how that could effect the review of non-regulars.

I would absolutely recommend stopping by if you're in the area. They also have a delicious list of sweet and savory crepes, which my friend kept constantly raving about (she had the peaches & blueberry). Don't miss out on this cute little gem!",1
JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g,"Walk through the doors of Le Petit Triangle, and you are automatically transported to an authentic Parisian Cafe.  And as a francophone who has been to ol' Paris more than once, I can vouch for the authenticity of the vibe.  

This place has been on my list of ""must visit"" locations since returning to Cleveland, and I was glad to find myself down in the Ohio City area near lunch one day last week so I could spontaneously pop in and peruse the menu.  

Incidentally, I had also been craving escargot recently (don't judge, if you've had a good iteration of this dish, you will, too).  My eyes made a beeline on the menu towards this particular appetizer and I put my order in right away.  

I was not disappointed when - about 15 minutes later - my sizzling hot, fresh escargot was delivered to my table with a side of crusty baguette slices.  I could smell the melted butter, garlic, and herbs wafting out of the piping hot dish, and started salivating in anticipation of my first bite.  Mmmmmmmm, heavenly!  The inner dragon that had been roaring for me to satisfy my escargot craving finally quieted as I knew I had a failsafe place to come the next time I got an itch for some baked snails.  

Food aside, everything about this place reminds me of Europe: the intimate tables, the large bar in the front, the tall windows facing the street, and decor that is warm and inviting without trying to be perfect.  The service was ""just enough"", with my server unobtrusively refilling my water and bringing me my food, while also allowing me to peruse the novel I had brought to keep myself company.  

Treat yourself to a mini vacation across the pond with a visit to Le Petit Triangle!",1
JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g,"Yum Yum Yum. This restaurant is a hidden gem in the Ohio City part of Cleveland. It is right across from the library and when we went, there was ample free on street parking. This restaurant has some really authentic french dishes but it also has some more Americanized options for people that are not as adventurous. 

We started our meal with 2 shots of espresso. I know this is backwards, but it was getting late in the day and I didn't want to stay up all night. The espresso was pretty smooth, but I wish it was served with a mini Biscoff cookie like in France. We had escargot in butter and garlic with massive pieces of bread as an appetizer. I personally love escargot this way. It is so buttery and delicious. Snails are very similar to mussels but slightly larger and chewier. For lunch I had a salad with balsamic lentils and smoked trout and my man had the croque monsieur. My meal was very tasty, fresh, and light. I normally wouldn't order this but I wanted something lighter and healthier. I did have a taste of the croque monsieur and by golly that was delicious and creamy. We finished our meal with a plain butter sugar crepe which was scrape the plate good.

I highly suggest going here. It is located in a slightly bizarre place, but the food is great and they have some pretty awesome options that you can't get everywhere.",1

My favorites have to be the pineapple upside down cake (amazing but seasonal), carrot cake, German chocolate, salted caramel (a little too salty sometimes), and the lemon.  The cake is moist, the flavors are authentic (hate when flavors taste like flavoring and not the natural flavor), the frosting is good (almost all buttercream or cream cheese based) and they are filling. My husband and I split one.

Suzy is always importing new and exciting things for the store, and is happy to give recommendations on anything from beer to chocolate. If you're looking for GlÁE¼wein, they also have it here -- the perfect German spiced wine, best served hot!

They said they could seat us, but we only had an hour and 15 minutes to have our table because then they needed it for reservations. Kind of awkward to put a time limit on our stay, but we understood and were well taken care of without feeling too rushed.

We skipped appetizers and each ordered a salad. I really loved my arugula salad. I also had a half portion of the gnocchi. It was alright, but considering we honeymooned in Italy and had very authentic dishes, my expectations weren't super high. 

The service was great. We never felt rushed. My party loved their dishes, I felt like mine was just okay. I'm giving 4 stars though because they took such good care of us!",1

The soup of the day was like a thick mush stew. Had a bite of my friends food. It was way too salty as well. They are trying to create flavor with salt as opposed to real, natural, authentic ingredients. I am absolutely not a fan. Go to Olive Garden. They have more flavor than this place.",0

JkQSLe_rBftbTJdZuQFlSw,"Chinato puts the same emphasis on decor and ambiance as L'albatros. But the overall feel/look is much different. Chinato feels modern, yet cozy and intimate, yet airy. I loved the openness and soothing color palette.

The menu carried the same authentic charm.

My friend Jenn and I wanted to sample of variety of Chinato's offerings. If you are trying out a restaurant for the first time and want to sample it ALL, go with my method: a little bit of this, a little but of that  

We ordered an appetizer, starter salads, a side, soup and a ""small plate"" version of a pasta entree (I love that Chinato offers this figure-friendly portion!) 

We started with Jenn's selection, the Suplee, pan-seared risotto balls with fresh mozzarella cheese. Balls of heaven. These crunchy morsels held cheesey, gooey goodness that had us saying ""mmmmmmmmmmm"" and ""nomnomnomnom!"" I tried to limit myself to just a two- we had a full meal ahead!

Next up, arugula with julienne of pumpkin, roasted turnips, pumpkin seeds, goat cheese and balsamic vinaigrette. One of the main things I was looking forward to in this salad was the PUMPKIN. Unfortunately, there wasn't much of it. I was expecting more of a pumpkin punch! Although I suppose others might find my typical love of pumpkin a bit too intense, so subtle may have been the right route to take.

For my main ""meal,"" I enjoyed the Ribollata, a dish explained as a ""minestrone-like stew."" This soup was delicious! I couldn't even count count all the veggies! Jenn and I both couldn't believe how much flavor was packed into each bite! I have GOT to try and get some details on this recipe next time I'm at Chinato. I think the key is cooking the pork and letting it get all nice and smoky before incorporating it into the soup with the roasted veggies.

Jenn was kind enough to share her main dish with me: Gnocchi with tomato, basil, toasted garlic, butter and parmesan. wowzer! Best.Pasta.Ever. No joke. And I live in LITTLE ITALY! This gnocchi was sensational. Each pillowy noodle melts in your mouth and sets your taste buds into overdrive. I'm quite impressed that I was able to stop myself from grabbing the dish from Jenn and inhaling it in all its buttery glory.

On the side, Jenn and I both loved the white beans I ordered. These were seasoned with parsley and were so simple and satisfying. I didn't think a side of white beans could be so delicious... And the presentation was adorable!

Jenn and I both agreed that it just wasn't right to judge a new restaurant without ordering dessert! The Tiramisu was fantastic! I loved the nutty layers of breading/walnut and how they complimented the light cream so nicely.

But as amazing as it was, it didn't hold a candle to the delicious Chocolate Hazelnut Mousse Cake. When angels cry, I'm certain it's because they ran out of this cake in heaven. Seriously.",1
JkQSLe_rBftbTJdZuQFlSw,"Today was the first day Chinato offered lunch, so I went there with a few friends from work. The menu is pretty extensive, and fairly authentic. The restaurant serves things like beef tongue, oxtails, calf liver, etc along with gourmet pizzas, paninis and pasta. The drink menu looks pretty good too. Next time!

For lunch, we tried some of the pizzas, the pappardelle pasta, the canneloni, and the mussels. The food was delicious! My only qualms with the place are these: they did not bring you a bread basket - and although it's nice to have a waiter come by and serve you bread piece by piece, it gets a little annoying if he keeps bringing bread to people who don't want more and then not bringing bread to people who do want more. They might want to rethink the bread basket-less idea. 

Further, the dishes were all pretty small - from the pizza to the mini canneloni entree! I might not have thought much about this, seeing as its an upscale place (which seems like it might tend towards the smaller, gourmet portions, BUT the waitress prefaced our food by saying that all the portions were ""pretty hefty"" and a good size. So we were all expecting a little more sizeable than the mini salad, mini canneloni and small, thin crust pizzas. 

Overall a good experience - just dont expect big portions for your money.",1
JkQSLe_rBftbTJdZuQFlSw,"I was really excited for my meal at Chinato, but it turned out to be a-ok. 3.5 stars for this restaurant. I would be interested in coming back to try other dishes if a friend really wanted to go.

We came here to treat a friend who was visiting in town. He is a lover of Italian food, and after one look at the menu, he knew it was legit. I hear Zack Bruell really tries hard to make his meals authentically Italian.

Service: 5 -- Bruell's restaurants are always run very well. Our glasses were never half full, we were offered bread whenever our plates ran out, and they were very interested in making sure we had a good experience. My one issue is that our server wasn't as knowledgeable about the menu as with Bruell's other restaurants. She had to go and ask others for more information.

Ambiance: 4 -- really great ambiance and fitting for E 4th St. Lots of modern lines and decor, and lots of fairly well-dressed people coming in for dinner after work.

Food: 3.5 -- I ordered the spaghetti with seafood - a simpler dish, but I was really looking forward to it. Very simple flavors with the seafood and tomato. I would say that the salt water broth was the best -- really great combination and good flavor, but it wasn't very deep. The pasta wasn't particularly moving or fresh. 

My friend got the gnocchi - very popular at the restaurant, and he was very satisfied. It was restaurant week, so my beau got the prefixe which included the tuna tartare (I think), the vegetarian cannelloni, and a dessert. It was very average. I would say go with the gnocchi.",1
JkQSLe_rBftbTJdZuQFlSw,"Authentic spirit, mediocre food.

The menu options are immediately eye-catching. Lots of authentic Italian dishes and jargon that will lead to most diners needing to ask questions or consult their smartphone. However, the food itself wasn't up to the standards the authenticity suggested. The fennel salad - which sounded like a traditional Sicilian salad but ended up being nothing like it - almost entirely fennel, only minimal olives, oranges and other goodies. The proportions were totally wrong. The arugula salad was ""fine"".

For entrees, it turned out less than half of the pasta dishes on the menu had fresh-made pasta, opting for boxed instead. This drove us to a cream-based pappardelle we didn't want in the first place - not big on cream sauces - and a pizza option that was underwhelming.

The service was fine, no complaints or celebrations here.

Not a bad place, but sets your expectations high before underwhelming.",0
JkQSLe_rBftbTJdZuQFlSw,"Chinato. Italian for too many god damn choices!!! 

Yeah I get it, Zack Bruell was inspired. He traveled to Italy to bring back examples of ""real"" Italian food that has lacked in this red sauce and spaghetti dominated city for all too long. But at some point, I think Chef Bruell bit off just a tad too much in his venture judging by his overaggressive menu. The menu is an encyclopedia of authentic Italiano cuisine broken into eight categories: Crudo, Antipasti, Salads, Pasta, Entrees, Pizza, Contorni and Dessert. An overbearing amount of choices.

I really think there's something to be said for simplicity. Pick a few things and do it well. Over-complicating the issue can lead to an unfocused product and an overwhelmed customer. I consider myself a fairly well-rounded diner with an above average grasp of cuisines of all types and I was dizzy after considering the nearly endless amount of choices on this menu. In the end, I surrendered to the hands of our waiter and his recommendations.

To start, we shared the SupplÁE¬ al Telefono which were stuffed rice balls with a tomato sauce. Next, I had the Zuppa di Pesce, a fish stew consisting of clams, mussels, shrimp and a red sauce broth. I found the depth in this stew lacking and probably not something I'd order again. For dessert, the Lemon Pollenta Cake, which was the star of the night. 

Overall, I don't think Chinato is as focused, nor is it yet the masterfully executed food haven as Bruell's other two well-oiled machines, L'Albatros and Paralllax. Perhaps someday it will get there, but the food and ambiance didn't blow me away at Chinato like it did at L'Albatros. If Bruell's three restaurants were the 1927 Yankees, Chinato would ",0
JkQSLe_rBftbTJdZuQFlSw,"Nice authentic Italian restaurant. We had the lamb with Brussels sprouts and roasted potatoes $24, and the Zupan de Pesce $30 ( which is a seafood dish with mussels shrimp and clams and a slightly spicey red sauce).  The bread is very good and the service is outstanding. The lamb is a smaller dish and the right size. My husband didn't care for the pasta dish and thought it was because of the slight spiciness. The desserts are fabulous and I had cherry gilato and the tiramisu is amazing. I will definitely come back for the pizza next time. I thoroughly enjoyed the authentic espresso.",1

So, I never have actually been to a Kung Fu Tea (as it's a chain), so I don't know how it compares to others. Sure, I still wish for like the 200 flavor places in Richmond Hills, but hey, this is CLE. However, I was happy an authentic tea place opened up in university circle!

With Kenko (a build your own sushi bar) right next to it, Kung Fu Tea is located in a great location for Case students. For those who work around the area, it's still good location as well. :)

I ordered the longan red date tea, regular ice, half sweetness, nata jelly. The tea was good, the jelly as well. I found it to be a tad too sweet to my liking (maybe they forgot the half sweetness?) but hey, I don't ever add sugar to my coffee, so I'm a different one.

We'll be back to try the different flavors. Good assortment of teas (citron, taro, oolong, white gourd, yogurt grapefruit), so it'll be interesting. And I'll probably order mine with less sugar next time too.. But overall, probably the best place in CLE to grab some Asian bubble tea most definitely!",1
jmTirQw-n4V_Z4g1-RE9iw,"Finally!! A place with REAL, authentic tasting bubble tea. I love that they have a quick to-go station for people and love that you can customize your tea to a large extent. 

I find that a lot of bubble tea places in Cleveland are extremely Westernized: tons and tons of sugar. Here, I got to pick 50% sugar as part of my order options and it came out PERFECT. Highly recommend doing the coconut milk tea with the bobas. I will be back!!",1
jmTirQw-n4V_Z4g1-RE9iw,"Well, I've been trying to get rid of this listing because Kung Fu Tea is basically part of Kenko, but Yelp won't take it off for me.  So now I need to review this too.

I don't have much more to say that isn't in my review of Kenko.  This is a chain that is very popular on the east coast and has finally, at long last, made it to Cleveland.  Heard they are going to have one in Columbus too.  It's bubble tea, as authentic and ""legit"" as can be, that fills a 7 year bubble tea void that I have had in this city.

For those of you who might be visiting from San Francisco (not that anybody would), this Kung Fu Tea is much better than the one in San Mateo.

For those of you who haven't tried bubble tea before, it's basically flavored tea (or plain tea), usually mixed with milk, and with sweet, chewy bubbles (""boba"") on the bottom that you eat with your tea.  You get a big straw to suck up the bubbles with.  If you are trying it for the first time, I would suggest getting just the regular Kung Fu Tea (not the flavored stuff), with bubbles, 50% sugar.  Quite honestly I usually go 25% sugar because bubble tea with full sugar can be cloyingly sweet.",0
jmTirQw-n4V_Z4g1-RE9iw,"Kung fu tea has all your basic needs in boba and is open pretty late which is a plus. Overall the tea itself is not authentic authentic, but does the job and their menu does better in their sweet drink varie-tea (ie milk teas and toppings) - I usually get their honey oolong milk green tea. The boba is surprisingly chewy, and flavorful. The only drink I'd warn against is the rosehip which is more like an artificial fruit punch than anything else!",1
jPrN8a-JW-wA52NPwE0VoQ,The owners are really nice and the gyro meat and pitas are good so I hate that I can't give a better rating. But the sauce is truly awful. It's not at all authentic: it has a gelatinous look and feel and a bland taste. It's as if they use cheap yogurt containing gelatin instead of authentic Greek yogurt. Very disappointing.,0
jQe-ZROYfR7dTgUhAtjvrQ,"I loveeee Angies.  It's a quick and easy opportunity to grab delicious home-cooked food for dinner.  

I almost always get something ""smothered"" because their various gravy's are absolutely delicious!  The mac and cheese is hearty and cheddery, the okra is crisp, the potatoes are smooth, I mean, honestly, all the sides are great!  

Lastly, I wanted to suggest that everyone try a jar of Kool-Aid.  It's glowing ecto colors radiate from their cooler.  It's a nostalgic way to wash down dinner (and for me at least, you cut it with a LOT of water so it goes a long way!).",1

JX1_mKHN38bjgQP0JB3fkg,"Tink Holl Seafood is the new Chinese restaurant in [Asia]town that now currently occupies what used to be space in the Tink Holl store that used to store novelty ""traditional Chinese"" wares that included sculptures, furniture, and the like. It pits itself against big boys of Wonton Gourmet, Siam Cafe, and Li Wah within a 5-minute driving distance....

Unfortunately, it doesn't really hold up all that well compared to the Cleveland Asian Standards. While they do have an Asian menu and they try for authentic dishes and taste, the restaurant falls flat. The tofu in the ""fancy tofu"" dish we ordered seemed to be old and stale, while the scallop dish we ordered had barely less batter to the scallops than scallop while being drowned in sauce which made the batter soggy and pointless (and who batters seafood in authentic Chinese dishes, anyway? -- OK, maybe shrimp, but you get the point). However the vegetables that came with the dishes were cooked and were quite edible. The food isn't horrible (I give that honor to the Cincinnati Chinese restaurants with broad brush strokes). It's just overall acceptable.

Upsides: Service is very friendly, and it's a good spot to grab a bite before or after shopping at the grocery store next door. I believe it's open until 2AM (unless I'm wrong), so it's good for late-night eats. Prices are reasonable. However, in terms of value, it falls way short, like compared to the likes of Wonton Gourmet around and down the street. I would like to give this place another try some time in the future to see if they improve, but it probably won't be any time soon, since I can just go to another restaurant in the area that has better food.

I would give Tink Holl 2.5/5 stars, if I were able to, but I rounded up, since there are cities that do not have restaurants that have quality at least comparable as Tink Holl.",0
JX1_mKHN38bjgQP0JB3fkg,"My fellow Yelpers friend Joyce P. and Rachael N. and I decided to try Tink Holl since we were all excited about trying a new restaurant together. 

I do like a feel of the restaurant. It has a homely Asian feel to it and there were a lot of space in the restaurant. The other good thing i like about this place is how many dish selections they have and the price of the food was very well priced. 

The 3 of us ordered a seafood tofu casserole, garlic eggplant, and beef pan fried noodle. 

Garlic eggplant: I'm not a huge eggplant fan but I heard garlic eggplants are really delicious so I gave it a shot. I didn't taste a lot of the garlic flavors to it. The texture of eggplant wasn't bad but the flavors just wasn't there for me.

Seafood Tofu Casserole:This was one of the better dishes we got. The flavors were there and there was a great amount of portion of it. But as much as I like it, they just don't make it the way Wonton Gourmet does (still my favorite yet). 

Beef pan fried noodle: the noodles were delicious! The veggies were delicious, but I thought the beef had a bit of a weird texture to it and i didn't know it was the amount of corn starch or what. 

Overall pros: good price, big portions, lots of varieties
Overall cons: scary neighborhood, flavors don't stand out enough

Either way, I think Tink Holl is a decent authentic Chinese restaurant. It does beat those crappy Chinese restaurants with americanized names but Tink Holl cannot compare to some of the best chinese restaurants here (wonton gourmet, pacific east, hunan east, etc...).",1
jXo3-D3fCzaQzLE0NRZlZw,"AngelaMia Deluxe was above par. Not your cookie cutter ""authentic"" frozen dough. Sauce slightly sweet and the flavor came through past the not-too-spicy italian sausage. Did the delivery, which arrived 65 minutes from time of order. Salad was good, fresh and not packaged. The delivery person was very nice. Ordered an apple cobbler, which I thought was slightly uncharacteristic for an italian restaurant.  The top of the container was dated 12.2.15. Today is the 13th. Either really old or frozen and reheated...didn't taste old. I would order again. Love that they have their own online ordering.",1

The only thing that wasn't super-stellar was the food.  The hollandaise sauce on the crab benedict wasn't authentic hollandaise (though yummy), and the burger didn't rock my date's world either.

They also serve mofongo, mangu, platonos al orden, sancocho (today was too HOT for that), pastelitos (also known as empanadas).  It's a small, humble restaurant w four tables, but the food is as real as it gets.  If you don't have your Dominican grandmother at home to cook for you, come here.

KB5iCfg8sW1NeNQV3HToCw,"I would like to first start out with a few positives...
 
The space is absolutely unique and swanky! The staff was attentive. The drinks were delicious. 

Now onto the full experience...

We were there on a Friday evening during what should have been a dinner rush, but we were one of only three seated tables, which would be fine if the space wasn't so vast. It was odd being in such a large space alone. It lacked intimacy. 

We ordered cocktails and h'ordeuvres to start. The cocktails were all mixed very well, but our first round of food was less than ideal. The chorizo queso dip tasted store-bought and lacked any authentic flavors. The lamb shanks were prepared well, but lacked inspiration. 

Our entrees were a mixed bag also, my partner's burger was phenomenal and prepared to the correct temperature and seasoned very well, but my filet was far beyond the point of ""rare"" and lacked in the taste category. 

We opted out of dessert.  

This place would be great for a quick cocktail with friends especially if you are seeking a different vibe than traditionally offered in Cleveland Heights.",0
kd4PwIjtWK2Lx0wUcovo5A,"If you're looking for really good Italian food in Cleveland Heights, you've found your spot. I haven't had pizza this authentic since I backpacked across Europe after I graduated with my Philosophy and Gender Roles in Postracial America degree from Case Western. 

The service here is amazing. My waiter Bradley was so attentive to my every need. And don't get me started about the ambiance. It looks like a romantic cafe straight out of Venice in the middle of Cleveland Heights. 

Now onto the food. In my world and national travels, I've had some good pizza. Personally, I think NY pizza, like everything else in New York City is overrated and not terribly unique. I've been to all of these places- Capri's needs to just turn into jeans. I've been to Santarpio's in Boston which was better than any NY pizza, aside from the fact that my car got stolen in that neighborhood. 

Stop in an try their margherita pizza and enjoy a glass of Chardonnay on the lovely patio!",1
kd4PwIjtWK2Lx0wUcovo5A,"My NYC pedigree has turned me into an over critical pizza snob who will usually only indulge when visiting family. Cleveland pizza is a weird variation and I don't enjoy many places even though I have become accepting of the Appalachian Hillbilly style. Crostata's is good although it is more of an authentic Neapolitan pizza. I prefer the NY style above all. Marotta's has flown under the radar for quite a while and when I heard that it is NY style I knew that I had to try. The only other NY pizzas I can think of are Vincenza's, Capri, Sweet Basil and Bucci Brick Oven and am not too fond of them. Vincenza's has awkward business hours, Capri is glorified mall pizza with a weird overuse of garlic, Sweet Basil and Bucci's both miss the mark somehow. Marotta's seems to be truest to the style and taste. If this were in NYC I wouldn't eat there. We are 500 miles away so it gets the pass. It reminds me of an NY pizza one may find in Florida. The taste is not exact. The sauce is decent and the cheese is good enough. My main gripe is with the crust. I am starting to think the whole idea of the chemical composition of NYC public water may play a huge role in the dough for pizza. The crust is a little too chewy and does not break easily when bitten. I also prefer the crust to have char without being burnt. It is a fine line to walk. Maybe it is the oven temperature. I will request well done next time and try my luck. Overall, this is a good substitute for the real. I encourage anybody who loves NY pizza to give Marotta's a try. People always gripe about the hours of Vincenza's and this solves that issue. $10 for a regular cheese pizza is the nice price.",0
kex_-dwIA1Ia5sDDje7beQ,"Very rarely will I give one or two stars to a local business because I realize they are just trying to survive. However, I spent a decent amount of money here for a terrible product, so I feel responsible to warn others of my experience.

Everything here looks great when you pass by and I had just got back from London and was sort of missing the terrible for you pies, pasties, etc. I couldn't resist stopping our group and insisting we did a little British style snacking. I regret that now ... and $40 later. What we got was dry, overcooked, microwave reheated food. Irish and British food is not the healthiest of fare and not known for it's overabundance of spices. Most authentic Irish pubs in Ireland I've been in use very little salt or seasoning and tourists gripe about the food's blandness. They at least got that part authentic here at Reilly's.

We had Scotch Eggs, which are a typical pub snack across the pond. These were made with no care and they used a hard boiled egg which was cooked again while frying, then again in the microwave which made it hard and chewy. Essentially, that egg is being cooked 3 times over a number of hours in that manner. Usually, you soft boil the egg before placing it into the sausage mix so it doesn't get hard and chewy. The sausage exterior was bland and spongy. The panko breadcrumbs on the outside were dry and added to the dryness. It tasted like a chewy egg wrapped in cardboard pieces. No gravy or mustard was served with the cardboard egg making it even worse.

The pasties looked fantastic but were also dry and bland. The ingredients didn't feel like they were mixed well and these too were heated in a microwave so the edges were chewy and overdone while the center was on the cool side. Not great.

To make things even worse, the clerk shortchanged me when I paid. At that point, it was only a few dollars and I never planned to come back, so I didn't push the issue. A few pasties and scotch eggs cost us almost $40. The prices here are what you'd pay if you were eating fresh food from a pub but instead you get cold, dry, reheated shortcut pub food. I hate to give a local business such low stars but really, it was a waste of $40 plus the extra we were shortchanged so be careful if you decide to eat here.",0
kf5vUoZTGedgydqce2e08g,"I just don't understand the hype about this place, other than the  jazz.  The food is ok, but nothing that I would call New Orleans-style.  

The food is mediocre at best.  Overseasoned and inauthentic.  I have had the Jambalaya, Gumbo and Etoufee, and neither are close to what I get in the south.  They tasted ""prepared"" and the fish did not taste fresh.  Cleveland used to have a more authentic New Orleans restaurant called Red Fish, over on 9th, which was much better and much more authentic.  

Drinks were ok and the noise-level was high.  Prices were not that bad but the food was.  

I have gone a few times when friends insisted, but this is not a place that I would go to on my own.  Definitely no ""wow"" factor.",0
kf5vUoZTGedgydqce2e08g,"We were recommended here by the staff at the Doubletree hotel during our one night visit. Being fans of Cajun food, my boyfriend and I were very excited to get some crawfish and gumbo! The restaurant was large and very festively decorated but seemed to be understaffed that night. It was a game night (Indians) so we thought there might've been more of a crowd at the bar but it was pretty dead.

I had a cocktail in a souvenir glass and my boyfriend had their beer special for $2. Both were very good! I loved the glass as I could take it home with me as a reminder of the trip. We ordered the corn bread, a large boil (with crawfish, mussels, shrimp, andouille sausage, corn, and potatoes) to share, and a cup of gumbo.

The corn bread was DELICIOUS! Being both southerners, we appreciate some good corn bread and this one was flavorful and moist. The boil was a tad dissapointing as it was dry - the crawfish tasted awful as if it'd been sitting around for ages. The mussels, shrimp, sausage, etc. was tasty and seasoned well. The gumbo had some good flavors but definitely wasn't authentic Cajun style.

All in all, if this place were in the south, I would've given it 2 stars. But for Cleveland, I'll give it 3.",1
kH8BdX2FEdREBXfeDsgjYw,Phenomenal!  Eccentric and authentic at an affordable price!,1
KHdYW6Wl4wWXW60by60P0A,"This restaurant has a very strong hipster vibe, with its wide variety of customizable drinks and food bowls. I really liked the drinks - I got the matcha tea with chocolate milk and it had some very unique flavors. Food wise, I would say overall it's like a more upscale Chipotle with better, healthier ingredients. I got the banh mi nachos which were really nice, though I wish it had come with some rice to be honest. My girlfriend got the bulgogi, which tasted honestly more like well done steak than bulgogi but it wasn't too bad. The rest of my friends all had the poke and did not like it, though I didn't have the poke myself so I can't really form an opinion on that. 

Rebol in many ways is similar to Noodlecat - it is an American establishment that has its own spin on Asian style dishes, while also serving unique coffee and tea drinks. Based on how my Asian friends reacted, it's not the type of establishment meant for people looking for authentic, traditional Asian food, but if you approach the restaurant with an open mind then it can definitely have its own appeal.",1
KHdYW6Wl4wWXW60by60P0A,"I wanted to try this place ever since it opened. They've got a really cool set up where the whole front of the restaurant is transparent glass looking out onto the center of public square. Decor is super hip and they have awesome outdoor patio seating with a ping pong table. 
Menu is small but everything sounds really unique.
I ordered the bulgogi steak bowl and my boyfriend had the REBol chicken. I didn't like either dish. The jasmine sticky rice was very sour and they gave you way too much rice and way too little meat. The slaw on the side was all vinegar. I've had authentic Korean bulgogi many times back home in NY and this is not that bulgogi. I'm not sure why they even call it bulgogi because it was cooked in curry sauce and I couldn't taste any traditional bulgogi marinade at all. The only tasty thing was the deep fried wonton chips, but how can you mess up deep fried anything. 
That being said, I did not try the any of the coffee or smoothies that a lot of the other people were stopping in for. I'll probably come back to try the drinks but will not be ordering the food again.",0
KhtmCNHqCH6cnxirsenndA,"Huge potential for a 4 star review except the last 2 times visiting had me wondering if a trend has started.  Both food and service was sub par.

I just love places like this, reminds me of home in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.  Just a cozy feel to the place, nice patio, bathrooms are big, and the service is spot on.

Food:  I liked the burgers but have other places to go for them now.  The mussels are good.  The alfredo, as Sam states, is really good.  I always make it a habit to get any specials a restaurant is running for the night (on the weekends only) and its been a fresh catch lately which they cook to perfection with just enough seasoning.  Of course they have a full bar and I prefer to sit in this area when eating.  A little older crowd but I've met some very unique-in-their-own-way people here which made for good convo.

They have a spicy shrimp that seems to only be sold on Fridays, and plantains are damn near impossible to get. Portion sizes are healthy. Pricing is moderate, but don't plan on leaving without spending at least $10.",1

KIanJQ6ZouQRQeaim8gZHQ,"I had been here during the week for lunch a long time ago, and we came in again for brunch yesterday.  It was pretty empty, though a few more parties trickled in while we dined.  Perhaps it was because it was brunch as opposed to weekday brunch, but there was no bread service this time.  This was a bit disappointing because I recall my son really enjoying the bread last time.

At first, the restaurant reminded me of some of the museum restaurants in NYC, like the Modern inside MoMA or Untitled inside the Whitney Museum, but less pretentious and with fewer offerings.  There is a nice clean look to the restaurant with a few tastefully picked pieces of artwork throughout.  We sat in the main dining area, but I believe there is another sitting area inside.  

While the feel of Provenance reminded me of the Modern, the food does not compare.  It is far from being of Michelin quality; other than being prepared well (technique and seasoning were spot on), there is nothing particularly special about it.  They do pay attention to the presentation though, which is only fitting for being located in a museum of art.  My mother-in-law's latke came with a few slices of smoked salmon, shaped into a pretty pink rose.  While tasty, the food is not Michelin quality like the Modern but is still very good.  Prices are a bit high and the portions can be small, depending on what you order.  I had the szechuan trout, which despite being the most expensive item on the menu was definitely the smallest and left me hungry.  The fish was cooked well, though it may have been overcooked simply because it was such a thin piece of fish -- even the server said, ""it's hard to see but the trout is in there"" when placing it in front of me.  I did appreciate the crispy skin.  To my dismay, there was nothing particularly szechuan about it, save for the light dusting of crushed szechuan peppercorns on top that one can barely taste.  A ginger tartar sauce accompanied the dish, but ginger is not a szechuan flavor.  I think it would've been better to have the szechuan peppercorn in the tartar sauce instead, or better yet skip the tartar sauce altogether in favor of a more authentic szechuan sauce.  A few more greens would've at least make me feel like I had more than an almost unfindable piece of fish and an egg with some vegetable garnish.  Out of the four dishes we ordered (trout, calabrian chicken and waffles, latke, and lamb burger), my favorite was the lamb burger, which is of decent size and quite tasty.

The place is beautiful, and it is not cheap, but it's a nice place to take out-of-towners or to go to for a special occasion without totally breaking the bank.  For a cheaper option with comparably tasty food, try the more casual Cafe next door.",0
km0bFbcjmggC-TfALhc75Q,"So you may drive past this place without appreciating there's a tremendous ethnic scene inside. Fortunately, if you have a taste for Jamaican or never had some supposedly authentic fare, this place is awesome. I also had the jerk chicken, large (really good size) which included 3 chicken breasts/wings that were well seasoned in the spicy jerk sauce, huge serving of brown rice with some bbq-style sauce on top, plus some rediculous mixed cabbage mix.

The atmosphere was simple but cool. Three guys with thick jamaican accents, accepting cash only, have a slew of made-in-jamaica sodas in the fridge and work listening to some cultural music overhead. Not many seats, like 7 or so, so take out or maybe you'll get lucky, but 3 of us at prime lunch time didnt have an issue. 

Would love to go back to this place as I left both satisfied and happy, and plan to try the BBQ jerk chicken special that's available on tuesday. Oxtail and fried plantanes are also on my list. Either way, you can't go wrong with this place and for 10 bucks, you'll be very happy getting a real taste of jamaica.",1

I stopped by about 1:30 and decided to get a large curry chicken and a beef patty.  There is not much seating to eat in, so you may want it to go.  The kitchen is open and can be seen and is very clean, good sign!

I ordered a large curry chicken and a beef patty.  Cost - $12.50. The beef patty looked a little smaller than I am used to but was really packed with meat. Not as spicy as I like, but very good.  This was authentic.

When I got to my destination I opened this huge dish of curry chicken, rice and beans and sauteed cabbage.  The only thing I can say EXCELLENT.  Just like I had in mobay (Montego Bay Jamaica)!

The only reason I took off one star is that they only accept cash.  In this day and age, that is a real deterrent.  But we'll worth stopping by a cash machine and getting cash for authentic Caribbean food!",1

The food is very fresh and authentic. I actually watched them cutting some cabbage and basting whole fresh fish while I was there. It's all made from scratch and you can watch the cooks while they prepare the food. It may be a small storefront but i was pleased with the quality of the food. 

Between my two trips I tasted the oxtails, jerk chicken, and stewed chicken. All of them were amazing. The stewed chicken was my favorite. All the meals come with traditional peas and rice and cabbage. You can also do white rice if you prefer. My family adored their meals. The meals are priced well and the portions are large. A small meal is around $8-10 while a large meal is $10-13. Make sure you grab a kola champagne and a beef (or chicken) patty as well. I got a ton of food and my bill was less than $15. This place will be a regular of mine.",1
km0bFbcjmggC-TfALhc75Q,"Who knew there's authentic Jamaican food in northeast Ohio?! I would definitely consider this place a carry-out, as the restaurant is very small, just a couple high top tables. The menu is pretty large and pretty traditional. They have a lot of dishes that I remember from my trips to Jamaica. I was especially happy that they had patties- kind of like a much more delicious hot pocket filled with beef, curried chicken, or veggies. 
We ordered the jerk chicken, the oxtail, and a couple patties. The portions are huge!! The large option, which comes with rice and veggies, is definitely big enough for two meals. The oxtail was awesome. Be forewarned that oxtail is very fatty and boney, but that's just the nature of the dish. The oxtail meat was so tender and delicious, it seriously brought me back to the island. 
The jerk chicken was a little subpar to what I was expecting. It just wasn't as spicy as what i wanted, much sweeter. But the chicken itself was very juicy and who am I kidding- we still ate it all. 
The best part of the meal was the patties. If you've never had a Jamaican patty, definitely try them here. They were awesome. 
Just an FYI, they are cash only. The nice man at the counter let us know that right away and also told us there's an ATM right next door. They also sell out of their popular items fairly early. We got there at 2pm, only two hours after they had opened and about 1/3 of the menu was gone. I'll just definitely get there earlier next time.",1

For example, he came to take our orders having not noticed that we didn't have menus. He repeatedly missed the mark, but never missed a chance to suggest a more expensive dish or use command language like, ""and what do you want as a starter?"" His tactics were offensive because it was obvious that he wasn't there to take care of us as much as himself. 

Lobster Mac n' cheese is not tapas, sorry guys. In fact, nothing on the Tapas section of your menu would be considered tapas anywhere else. 

There was no salt and pepper on the table and none in the kitchen. Food was bland and lacked seasoning. I didn't trust the authenticity of the dishes so I opted for something safe with the short ribs (Mediterranean?). The dish was tepid at best. The meat was tough for short ribs and not scored, leaving large fatty chunks for me to cut off myself. Clearly no one in this kitchen expedites looking at the dishes and considering if it looks like something they would want to eat. 

At one point the chef came out of the kitchen and asked how we liked everything. An awkward silence fell over the table as our party of ten was collectively not impressed. No one wanted to make the situation more awkward by telling him the many things that weren't good about the meal. The chef looked perturbed that we did not have anything to say so he crossed his arms and starred at us for a while. That was totally comfortable, way to check your ego dude! 

Then the waiter comes with the tab telling us that the house normally adds 18% gratuity for large parties, but he didn't add the 18% because he felt that he should only be tipped on what we thought was right. It couldn't have been more obvious that he was bucking for a larger tip than 18%. It was so obnoxious, I just wanted to tell him to shut up. 

I wouldn't return to this place to use the bathroom. The food is absurdly over-priced and the pretentious, pushy staff would ruin a meal even if the food was decent.",0
KnaIbUk-eQm_tEsENO1oFw,"This place is located in a little strip plaza in North Olmsted. It's nothing fancy, but they are consistent and have a good menu. I work out at the gym next door and a lot of people get take out. It's always ready on time. One of my complaints is that gyros are on the menu, but they aren't authentic gyros with meat being cut from the spit. The girl working was honest and did tell me this so I didn't order it. I also thought prices were a bit high given that his place is pretty low key.",1
KnaIbUk-eQm_tEsENO1oFw,Great food and the business owner is also really nice! Definitely worth stopping by for some authentic Mediterranean food!,1
KnaIbUk-eQm_tEsENO1oFw,I spent a great of time in the Middle East in various places and this is by far the best in Cleveland.  Everything I had is excellent.  Cooked perfectly and tastes authentic as can be.  I just love the salad as well.  Not a big salad guy but couldn't get enough.,1
KnaIbUk-eQm_tEsENO1oFw,"Absolute little Gem. The food was absolutely fantastic. Flavors were very authentic. Good spice. Excellent rice, tender chicken. 

What I loved more than the food was the service. Felt like I went into someone's home. The owner - I presume- took my order then said ok, give me five minutes and sprinted to the back. I was left there hanging with the credit card in my hand. Left wondering how I should pay, I hear- sit, sit, grab a drink, just pay after you eat.

Boy did I enjoy. Delicious.",1
KnaIbUk-eQm_tEsENO1oFw,"My friend I, who grab lunch around the North Olmsted area every Friday, went to Ohio Kabob Grill today for lunch for the first time. We ordered a chicken kabob, lamb kabob and a side of baba ganoush. We were totally blown away by the wonderful flavors. The baba had the strongest smokey taste, the homemade sauces were so exotic and flavorful. All item were incredibly fresh and authentic. I've only had Middle Eastern food at this level when I used to travel to The Detroit area. Skip Aladdins and try this place.",1
KnaIbUk-eQm_tEsENO1oFw,Great taste.  The salads and tabouli are always fresh and delicious. The meats are well seasoned.  The gyros are tasty.  The menu has some very authentic items you probably won't find anywhere else around here. So happy to have a healthy food option in the neighborhood. The chef and owner is really nice and always aiming to please.,1
KnaIbUk-eQm_tEsENO1oFw,"Wow, what a fantastic place... Glad that Yelp gave me the heads up on it.  Totally a hole in the wall kind of place. Came on new years eve and the entire strip mall was dark except this restaurant.  The Wife and I love Mediterranean food and this is a great example of an authentic restaurant.  We got the small sampler platter and it was delicious.  Best tabouli (sp?) I've ever had- wonderfully bright tasting.  Loved the samosas but sauces were probably unnecessary.  We had the Afghan chicken kabob and it was really delicious. I generally don't like ordering chicken because it tends to be overcooked, but this chicken was delicious.  Well marinated and perfectly cooked.  The rice that came with it was seasoned in a very unique way that we loved and the red cabbage salad that came with it was tasty and different.  Everything was made fresh and the owner came out afterwards to say hi.  Love this place, it definitely deserves more business!  I'll be back soon.",1
KnaIbUk-eQm_tEsENO1oFw,"Incredibly authentic and delicious food. 

Started with the hummus which was some of the best I've had in Ohio. The small size (16 oz) was enough to split between 4 people. 

The afghani chicken kebab came with perfectly cooked rice and a salad. The chicken was tender and seasoned perfectly. The portion size was not overly huge but was filling. 

Kunafe was also amazing for desert! Would come back again.",1
KnaIbUk-eQm_tEsENO1oFw,"Every once in a while you stumble upon a restaurant that really really surprises you. Sometimes it's the quality of the food, sometimes it's specific dishes you've never tried before or a culture whose food has somehow eluded you... in the case of Ohio Kabob Grill, it's all three and then some.

After the normal indecision that comes from a last minute search for a weeknight dinner, my significant other said, ""hey what about this afghan place... has great reviews"". ""Hmm"" I thought, how have I not heard about this place when it's relatively close, ethnic, and has pretty legit reviews. Why haven't I seen them in any of the normal hipster-y listicles like ""Top 10 ethnic gems in Cleveland"" etc.

After some quick deliberations, we decided to check it out.

I'll cut to the chase here- Ohio Kabob Grill is an absolute gem if there ever was one. Similar to a journalist getting the acclaim from breaking a big story, this is the place all of the ""foodie influencer"" types would dream of claiming credit for bringing attention to. It's just so great in every way- friendly people, authentic as can be, and food that is absolutely deserving of acclaim. After that first fateful trip we've already been back 3 times and each time we try something we can't pronounce but never fails to make us say ""wow"".

I highly highly recommend you go, and for a true Ohio Kabob Grill experience, just order the ""Mixed Grill"". You will be blown away by the food, the portions, and the price- the holy trinity of restaurant dining if there ever was one.

Oh and if this find/review is my journalistic ""big break"", tell the owner Al sent you.",1
KnaIbUk-eQm_tEsENO1oFw,"Our Uber driver recommended Ohio Kabob Grill for authentic Afghani food. I'm so glad we found this place, the food and service are nothing short of amazing. We love the lamb kabobs - they're served with rice and salad, but everything is so good. The owner is also extremely friendly and helpful.",1
KnaIbUk-eQm_tEsENO1oFw,"Great authentic food. The location is a bit off, but I'm willing to risk my life to have their food again OR do UberEATS.",1
knJh7agyWMdPyndI9dURjw,"terrible! was with a group of 10 for a bachelorette party. we had a reservation for 5pm. the restaurant was moderately busy for a saturday early dinner service. we arrived promptly at 5 and we expressed our desire to sit in the bar/patio area. the hostess told us that area was ""unreservable."" they sat us in the dark basement, right next to the kitchen. the server was friendly, but slow. he had a trainee following him too. he stopped back 3 times before even taking our food order. 
and then we waited for over an hour and 1/2 and still no food. four parties at the four- top behind us sat, ate and left before our food ever arrived. we asked manager if our food ticket had been lost. the server told us it was ""probably the steak that was holding us up,"" a medium rare piece of meat. conveniently sitting directly next to the open kitchen, we then watched the manager throw all of our 10 dishes together. once the food finally arrived, nearly an 1 and 1/2 after our orders were placed, the food was terrible.the beans were canned and under-seasoned. I ordered the
 ""Quesadilla traditionale"" for nearly 8 bucks, which was just a fancy way of saying small crispy tortillas with some shredded cheese, and a side of salsa. i am not a fan of unauthentic ethnic food unless it is fresh and innovative, and this was far from. the box taco kits i've made at home have rated better.
the manager gave us a discount on our bill for the wait.
had the server attempted to compensate for the poor experience, i would have felt better, but I think he gave up on us.
overall, quite a terrible experience with a restaurant in such a prime location.",0
knJh7agyWMdPyndI9dURjw,"Wasn't sure what to get when I arrived. Bartender mentioned the words chorizo, bacon, and burger and my search was over. One of my favorite burgers of all time now. You get chips and salsa but the salsa wasn't your average red fresh out of the can salsa. Legit, close to authentic greenish salsa, I almost finished the chips myself. Different but very delicious fries. I grew up on Mexican beer so that wasn't even an issue. Friendly staff. I will definitely go again.",1
knJh7agyWMdPyndI9dURjw,"Man, when did they change their menu? Wish I would have known. There used to be entree selections from three regions of Mexico and now  they've gone in a very different direction? Chorizo burger? Not exactly authentic Mexican. I tried it and it's just too much. So now there is one page of options, tacos, burritos, and salads. My wife got the burrito bowl and she said she had better ones from Moe's, the fast food joint. So, disappointing as I talked her out of going to Barrio, big mistake on my part. I have to say our server was very good, Patrick. However, we made a reservation and the hostess when I asked about the many open tables by the street facing window said, ""They're all reserved"". And of course by the time we left they were almost all still available. I guess my reservation wasn't important enough to get preferential seating. The bathroom was in bad shape and it was only 6:30pm. My shoe soles were covered in slime and were slipping across the tiles, disgusting. I will say if you just want to drink tequila and have chips and sit at the bar, it's probably okay, but otherwise, do what my wife told me we should do and go to Barrio. Oh, and their beer selection is lousy.",0
knJh7agyWMdPyndI9dURjw,"I went here last week on Taco Night and loved the authentic atmosphere-- you have to see what they do with tequila bottles! It was a little pricier than I expected, but I guess that has to do with the location and the celebrity chef that owns the place.

I'm surprised that there's such a low average of stars on here. The food wasn't spectacular, but it wasn't terrible. I sampled several tacos and they were all pretty good, and obviously it's pretty difficult to mess up margaritas, so if I were you, I'd definitely go to Taco Night if you're planing a trip there! If anything, I'd say the service was rather slow and seemed clueless. When I asked for a recommendation, they just laughed awkwardly and said that ""it's all good.""",1
knJh7agyWMdPyndI9dURjw,"I found myself walking past Zocalo on E 4th a number of times during lunch and at night and the majority of the time especially during lunch this place is packed. So I finally decided to go in and give it try, why not how bad can it be or good. So I started with a drink with tostadas and salsa, the waitress was very nice and on her ""A"" game. As I dipped in to the salsa and tasted it I found myself tasting a very bland, flat tasting, paste of marinara sauce. Yup marinara sauce not salsa marinara sauce. Very poor poor poor tasting salsa.

Next I ordered an enchilada plate with cheese inside them, refried pinto beans, and Mexican rice. As I took a bite of the red enchilada I have to say it was the worse enchilada I have ever tasted, the enchilada tasted like lasagna, the beans tasted straight out of the can, and the rice tasted like Uncle Bens instant rice with tomato sauce in it.

I have to say this is very subpar Mexican food and that's being nice, I now it's Cleveland and the restaurant has to cater to a different customer but boy was this poor tasting food. I make 100 times better Mexican food at my home kitchen then this place does. If this place needs some help when it comes to making salsa I can give them ideas, if they need some help in making better enchiladas I can help, and if you need help in finding authentic ingredients I can help. I know what real good quality Mexican food is and this isn't it.

Oh and by the way bar tenders Silver tequila is not good tequila reposado and aÁE±ejo are. Know you're tequilas and aging process.",0
knJh7agyWMdPyndI9dURjw,"Hands down worst Mexican cuisine I have ever experienced.  Fist off the margaritas. They had some decent flavors to choose from. Ordered the blood orange & 2 pomegranates. Like I said decent flavor but no booze. For $30 in drinks for my self I should at least catch a buzz. This was not the case. My wife had 2 margaritas and on the second one had to order a shot on the side just to make sure there was booze in it. I ordered the Chimichanga. I've had these many many times & loved everyone till tonight. It was very large and impressive. I have to admit I was excited unit I took my first bit. A Chimichanga I'd a deep fried burrito in a nut shell.  So it should be crisp. This was not the case. It was mush, like they only put it in the frier for 10 seconds.  I dissected the limp bland monstrosity in front of of me. Tasted the steak, it was OK,not great. Guacamole inside tasted just like avocado.  No seasoning.  Then I tried the rice. More disappointment.  Very bland. Tasted like white rice boiled in chicken broth.  Beans were OK. All in all the highlight of our meal was our glass of ice water. I will never be coming back to this establishment.  Go around next door to Barrio. Or Taco Bell. I guarantee you will get better, more authentic food there. Disappointment, frustration, & sober explains our $100 mistake of choosing this place.",0
knJh7agyWMdPyndI9dURjw,"I am disappointed to see all of the negative reviews for Zocalo. It seems that some expectations are a little misplaced. This is, after all, not a five star restaurant. For a dinner for two, including an appetizer and tip, I spent less than $40. For that price, I am certainly not expecting world-class cuisine. Although the food was not authentic Mexican food, it was certainly beyond the likes of a Taco Bell style menu where everything consists of a different arrangement of ground beef, cheese and less than fresh veggies. I thought the menu had some unique options that I don't see everywhere. My boyfriend and I both enjoyed our combination dinners as well as the appetizer and chips and salsa. We thought there was a great flavor to most of the food, especially the beef tamales. As a somewhat picky eater, I appreciated that the side condiments/ salsas came in a small, divided dish, so as to allow the guest to use them at his or her discretion.  Our server was attentive and competent. He was able to answer all of my questions about the menu and was on top of re-filling our drinks and chips. The atmosphere was appropriate for the price of the restaurant. It is a family restaurant, so I don't quite understand why anyone would compare it so harshly to something like Applebee's, as in my eyes, they are really along the same level of dining. For a casual meal at a great price, Zocalo has a lot to offer.",1
knJh7agyWMdPyndI9dURjw,"Are all the negative reviews a planned sabotage? I was in town for the Rock N Roll Museum and needed a taco fix. It was Taco Tuesday and happy hour at Zocalo and it was a lot of fun. The neighborhood of Fourth Street is real nice and the outside seating at Zocalo adds to the enjoyment. The tacos range from $1-$4 depending on what you get and half off margaritas during half hour are worth the price. My meal was pretty cheap and I don't think i would pay more than what I did for this food. As an Americanized Mexican cuisine it was good, the open faced tacos and selected ingredients bring rather close to the authentic feel. The food was moist and flavorful, the corn tortillas were warm and soft, however the chips were on the greasy side and the salsa was a bit bland with out adequate spice. 

I need to break down my review a bit: 
Food = 3 stars, Environment = 4 Stars, Drinks = 3.5 Stars

If i had to return to Zocalo i would do so on the same day of the week and same time. I am unsure if the place is worth the real price of the drinks (10 bucks for a margarita) and the food.",1
knJh7agyWMdPyndI9dURjw,"This place is under rated. Lots of healthy choices and opportunities to indulge.  Two pages of Tequila drinks and some authentic Mexican beer mixes.  I tried several and they were good.  Try the fajitas, quesadilla or the wide variety of tacos.  All delicious.  Definitely want to go back!!!",1
knJh7agyWMdPyndI9dURjw,"Stopped in here on  Friday evening without reservations, were seated promptly and waited on quickly.  This place deserves much better than 2 stars.  I did not find the food overly spicy at all, just flavorful like Mexican food should be.  Had sweet corn mole enchiladas and crab crusted mahi mahi.  Yummy all around.  Margaritas seemed authentic and not Americanized sweet.  Price was super reasonable for the quality.  They have managed to capture an authentic Mexican  restaurant without simply duplicating the menu selections, chips, salsa and margarita you have elsewhere.  Sure, you can get your American chimichanga here if you wish but there is so much better and authentic to choose from.",1
knJh7agyWMdPyndI9dURjw,"I was in town for the marathon this past weekend and following the race needed to get some ""real"" food before heading out to the airport to fly home.  

I was hoping to go back to the Irish pub across the street, where I had eaten lunch the previous afternoon and gotten great service (despite the fact that I had gotten caught in the rain on the way there and looked like hell) -- but, unfortunately, they did not open until 3 pm on Sunday.  So, since Zocalo's was open, and I like Mexican food, I thought I would give it a try.

Now granted, after finishing a marathon and still wearing my gear, I was not at my most attractive, but I think it was an improvement over my ""drowned rat"" look the day before.  But when I walked in, even though there was plenty of room to be seated in the main restaurant, I was told I could sit in the bar.  Well, after hours of running, I didn't relish the idea of balancing myself on a barstool to eat lunch, but luckily there was 1 booth available in the bar.

It took quite awhile for the server to stop by.  He took my drink order, and while I was waiting the host came over to see whether I had been helped yet.  I told him the server was getting my drink, but I still needed to see a menu.  He gave me one, and when the waiter returned I decided to order carnitas.

The beer (Dos Equis) was fine, but at $4.75 for a 16-ouncer, I felt the Murphys Amber I'd had the previous day at the pub across the street (for $6.00) was a better value.  

The chips were good/warm, and the salsa wasn't bad.

Although I had ordered refried beans with my meal, I received black beans.  The carnitas were good and came with 2 sauces.  The habanero sauce was OK.  I didn't care for the other one -- I can't even tell you what it was called or what may have been in it, I just didn't like it.

Shortly after I started eating my meal, a party of 4 was seated outside on the patio.  The weather that afternoon was sunny but very cool and windy.  After seating that party, the waitress decided it was necessary to open the entire patio doorway.  This caused a backlash among the other 4 parties that were seated indoors near the doorway, as the air coming in from the doorway was freezing.  One guy at a table across from me jokingly complained that he had planned to have 12 more beers, but not now!  In spite of eveyone's complaints, the door remained open.  

My overall impression:  The food isn't bad, but is more trendy than authentic, and seems a bit pricey.  The service is not so good -- I felt very unwelcome.  Initially, I thought I was feeling insecure because of how I looked, but after the patio door incident, I have concluded that the folks who work here don't particularly care whether you like their service or not.

I wish I had waited until 3 pm for the other restaurant to open.  I'm pretty sure it would have been worth the wait.",0
knJh7agyWMdPyndI9dURjw,"Yeeeah. Not often that I break out a one star review, and certainly not often I do it for a local place, but Zocalo is a scourge on the culinary scene of Cleveland, and it's unfortunately in a terribly prominent location. I feel sad whenever I see it full because it is not a good place by any measure. Whether you like authentic Mexican or cheese-laden fajita-driven faux Americanized Mexican, Zocalo can disappoint you. Good tequila selection. Decent happy hour drink prices. Abominable food.",1
knJh7agyWMdPyndI9dURjw,"Not what you expect or deserve.  The happy hour makes things seem not too bad, but if I were Aaron Sanchez, I wouldn't want my name associated with it.  The drinks seem not weak, but poorly made, and the food doesn't deliver on it's quality.  The choices sounds interesting and authentic, bit end up being bland, dry, or just average.  I have been here a couple times, but never reviewed it because I forgot I ever went there the second I walk outthe door.  That's about how memorable it is for me.  If it weren't in such a cool little area, I would never have gone after the first time, and doubt many would make their way out after getting their first try.  I could go on, but this place isn't even worth it.  Do yourself a favor: go anywhere around here that isn't HERE!",0
Ksk5cLav4OtbUtpRGp5b4g,"Very good tasting food.
This place is an example of ""hole in the wall"" type of restaurants, which generally serve great tasting authentic ethnic foods.
Ignore the shoddy tables, plastic cutlery and foam plates. Instead, focus on the food and service/hospitality.
The owner manages the front and his wife and few employees manage the kitchen. He has always been friendly and welcoming. His manner of treating guests is very casual but genuine and homely.
Food has always been good. From portions to flavors to prices.
Order off the menu - because of not enough traffic, buffet may not always be up to the mark.  We have had various curries, chaats and Samosa.  Everything was spot on.  Their pani-puri is very very good. The pani tastes pretty close to what I remember from india.
As someone else pointed out in review, their main business is take out and catering. So don't go there expecting Michelin star table service and ambience. The tiny place is good enough for those who want good food and don't mind simplicity.",1

Kuv-QSWUtOm5IjAxcFMl8A,"Luna Bakery Cafe started off as a small alcove on the Fairmount Hill that I never really paid much attention to. Since its beginning, they've expanded and turned into a bigger area that has a great seating area. Then I took the time to go in and see what they really had to offer. I have now been countless times, being a Shaker resident, it is just a short 5-10 minute drive from my house. I have fallen in love with the authentic tasting crepes they have to offer. There is quite a selection of different crepe makes as well as breakfast and lunch sandwiches available. When ordering crepes to go, they make it and put it in a to go box with all of your toppings on the side as so not to make the crepe soggy or mushy. Every time I have been, I have been completely satisfied with my visit. This is a must visit place in the Heights area.",1
Kuv-QSWUtOm5IjAxcFMl8A,"My experience with Luna Bakery was a recent stop-over for breakfast to go.  It a small little corner bakery offering a decent list of Panini and Crepe along with coffee drinks.  Its come in order and sit down or take out kind of a bakery.  The seating area is small, with a mix of cafe tables and seating at high stools along the back wall.

I ordered the Herb scrambled egg panini with ham.  I found this sandwich unfortunately soggy.  Although it was stuffed with quite a bit of scrambled eggs, ham, and cheese,  the typical crust factor to the panini was missing.  It almost seemed that the sandwich did not have enough time in the panini grill.   I was able to customize this panini with tomato and was offered other options like pepper, etc.  I noticed however each additional item lead to an additional charge to the price of the sandwich.  

The crepe that I got with nutella and banana was actually quite nice.  The crepe was thick yet airy and the portion of nutella and banana was well balanced.  I would definitely recommend the crepe here.   As one of the reviewers pointed out before the crepe are not authentic, then again, Luna does not seem to advertise themselves as a crepery but their offering of it definitely delicious.",0
Kuv-QSWUtOm5IjAxcFMl8A,"Prices are okay, but the crepes are NOT authentic.  The pastries are not French, they're Americanized French.  More sugar. 

I've ordered cakes from this baker, who operated under ""Flour Girl""-when she was a private baker working from her home.  Prices were reasonable and quality was decent (although the cake was a bit dry and the filling was incorrect).  Now the cakes are almost double the price, for something as simple as adding fondant (cheap) shapes cut out with a cookie cutter...like dots.  All of a sudden, the price is $80 plus for a ten-inch cake...frosted with butter-cream.  I got a more complex cake with the same icing/filling/with tons of fondant shapes from her before and it was $60.
Meh.
She's still better than White Flour Cake Shoppe, though.",0
Kuv-QSWUtOm5IjAxcFMl8A,"Quite a few crepe options have emerged I'm finding.  I'm a late adopter of this scene but I've been checking out a few. Crepes De Luxe at WSM, Le Petit Triangle in OH City, Kelly's Cafe in Brunswick (Owned by CH native), all great, but something seems so natural about Luna where it sits at the Cedar/Fairmount intersection in Cleveland Heights. There's definitely a market there, and if they could open up the storefront they would have recreated a Parisian cafe pretty authentically.

The menu goes well beyond crepes, although the crepe menu, and the ability to customize, makes it pretty lengthy itself. Add Paninis, pastries, coffees and teas, and it would be quite a while before you exhaust your options, or tire of your favorites.

And oh, this spot offers this ginger/molasses cookie that had me quoting a line from Jay & Ye's new single ""Paris""... That *ish CRAY!",0

Don't get the fried spring roll - it is not the authentic viet ones that come with the dipping sauce and lettuce. Reminds me of spring rolls from Chinese restaurants. 

Pho was ok- broth I give it a 3. Meat 3. Overall 3.

My parents never approve any places I choose when I take them out. So if my parents like it, it must be good!!! It's a must try, this place is a little hidden gem. Parking can be difficult bc it's in downtown, luckily I'm only 5 min walk away. Don't feel weird if you go there and it's empty around dinner time, it's a place that crazy packed during lunch.

kXIJwryYY2xDHNnI7jz-WQ,Yummy convenient and authentic restaurant. Wish they had more vegetarian options but otherwise nice spot,1
kXIJwryYY2xDHNnI7jz-WQ,"The vegetarian pho was not anywhere near authentic, sadly. Tasted like a vegetable soup, not like pho.",0
kXIJwryYY2xDHNnI7jz-WQ,"Pho Thang Cafe! After hearing about this new spot a couple of weeks after it opened, we made our way downtown to try it out.

It's a little hidden, but I usually can find parking by circling the streets and making sure it's past 6:30pm. But, being a pro at finding parking spots downtown, I didn't think finding parking was that bad. 

And as a disclaimer: I'm not Viet, so to be honest, I'm not sure what authentic Viet food should taste like. I mean, I've had the great food in Garden Grove, Vegas, and other highly populated areas with good Viet places....so, in my opinion, I think the food at Pho Thang was great! But yeah, I'm not Viet, so...take my review as it is. I must say though, all my Viet friends that have tried the place do say it is the most authentic they've had in Cleveland....so yeah...

It's a rather large restaurant- a big bar in the middle, a room to the side (for potential karoake! woohoo!) as well as a dining area. We were seated right away, which was nice.

First time I went, I tried B6- the grilled pork vermicelli. It was good- the pork was broiled and marinated very well, good noodles, and fresh ingredients. My wowza dish came with the second time I went though. Upon the recommendation of the waiter, I tried the beef noodle soup - B14. Now, this isn't your Taiwanese beef noodle soup you may be thinking about- it's a spicy beef noodle soup....that can come with pig's feet! Now, I LOVE pig's feet, so I was so surprised when they had mentioned the soup comes with it. I did a double ""what WHAT?"" and when I got the beef noodle soup, I must say- it's GOOD. The broth is sweet and tasty, and the meat and the noodles in it were great. By far, a really great dish.

Each time I've gone, I've ran into lots of friends that I have in the Asian community..which I think, is a good sign you've got a great restaurant. Thumbs up, Pho Thang- I'll be back...... especially for that beef noodle soup!",1
kXIJwryYY2xDHNnI7jz-WQ,"While in town for business/pleasure, some friends recommended this place for Pho. Pretty authentic, they were very clean and professional. Don't expect SoCal style with the cheap price and over stuffed bowls, the Pho here is neat and the portion is just right. Great place for business meetings, get together, date, and family. I couldn't believe they accommodated my SoCal request habit for: serving ribeye slices seperately, vinegar onions, and a separate bowl of scallion stems in broth. We stayed half past closing time on a Sunday night, and the owners waited for us without a mention of closing!",1
kXIJwryYY2xDHNnI7jz-WQ,"Entrance is located down a side street just before the Cleveland Federal Reserve truck entrance. While not familiar with Vietnamese, I'm going to go with 100% authentic. Had the garden spring roles and the Bahn Mi roasted pork sandwich with tai iced tea for lunch.  All of it was very tasty, though I could've eaten multiple orders of just the garden spring roles.  Note: Those with nut allergies will have to miss out on the dipping sauce ... and are cursed. Staff very friendly, too.",1
kXIJwryYY2xDHNnI7jz-WQ,"The food is super authentic. I had the bun bo hue, and it was so close to what my mom would make. The staff i prompt and sweet and i felt at home there.

kXIJwryYY2xDHNnI7jz-WQ,"Having lived in San Francisco for many years and been spoiled by the endlessly fascinating Slanted Door Vietnamese Cuisine as well as many smaller Vietnamese restaurants in the Bay Area, Pho Thang Cafe is simply the best Vietnamese one can experience now in Cleveland. 
With Pho Ha Nam in the Asia Town Center a close second, these two authentic Vietnamese restaurants are now far better than either the long established Superior Pho or downtown's Saigon. Bac in Tremont is a close third, but it can be a bit too Americanized in some of its offerings.
Pho Thang Cafe has the best Bahn Mi in Cleveland - hands down. 
And its tasteful Fresh Garden Rolls are actually that - fresh, delicious and plentiful!
Combined with an excellent balanced Peanut/Hoisin Sauce, these rolls are easily the best in Cleveland! (Pho Ha Nam is a very close second! Theirs are a bit smaller size.)
The Pho soups are fragrant, balanced, and tasty. And again, more than adequate portions.
The staff is friendly and professional and the overall restaurant is clean and well lit.
If you want to experience what folks get to eat on a daily basis in foodie/gourmet capital of America San Francisco, then you must go to Pho Thang Cafe. You won't be disappointed!",1
kXIJwryYY2xDHNnI7jz-WQ,"Park on Rockwell near the corner of Rockwell and E. 9th St.  Enter through the door on Rockwell.  Street parking is free on weekends.

The pho scene in Cleveland is extremely competitive, but I would say that Pho Thang stands up to the competition, and is one of the better places.  As for the pho - the broth is perfect, not too oily; the noodles are cooked well, the meat is a little tough; could be better.  The vermicelli was cooked well and had enough flavor for my taste.  Both seemed pretty authentic to me.  Looks like we have a new good pho option downtown.",1
kXIJwryYY2xDHNnI7jz-WQ,"They are not as good as the reviews. The ramen noodle was too dry, the pho was not the authentic Vietnamese pho.",0
kXIJwryYY2xDHNnI7jz-WQ,"First time in Cleveland and this place was next to my hotel.  Decided to give it a try.  I got the beef noodle special and the garden spring roll.  

I judge the beef noodle soup by the broth before adding any condiments.  The beef broth was good.  I dig it and enjoyed it without anything other than lemon.  Between light broth and heavy broth, I give this one a moderate.  The meat was good except for the meatballs.  While the meatballs are better than most I've tried, they failed in comparison to meatballs used in other pho joints, mostly in California.

The garden spring roll was good.  Has everything in it as expected.  The ratios of veggies in it was higher than I am used to but I enjoyed it.

Overall, it's a fairly authentic place for Vietnamese pho.  It is satisfying enough if you're from places with better food like California.  I would come back again.

Only one minor thing I didn't like.  The waiter only talked to me once.  He asked what I wanted to drink.  He didn't say another word to me afterwards.  I gave him my order then he grab the menu and walked away without a word.  Didn't say anything when he brought me my order.  Didn't stop by once during the meal.  Didn't say anything when he walked past and dropped the check on my table.  Didn't say anything when he walked by and grabbed the check.  I left him a bigger tip than I think he deserves.  I understand he was the only one there but I think service involves more than a shrug of the shoulders.

At the end of the day, food was good.  Service was meh.  Then again, it's a Vietnamese restaurant.  You should expect shitty service.",0
kXIJwryYY2xDHNnI7jz-WQ,Pho is authentic and always flavorful. They use great fresh ingredients and I am always impressed. Would recommend as a place to check out,1
kXIJwryYY2xDHNnI7jz-WQ,"So surprised at how authentic and delicious this spot is. Food is really affordable, great service.",1
kXIJwryYY2xDHNnI7jz-WQ,"Less expensive and more authentic than its downtown rival, this is a great spot for lunch. Their bahn mi is a positive bargain, and comes in three varieties. Pho is very good, and can be had with all the traditional cuts, including tendon and tripe. I could be wrong, but I think the place is family run - it definitely feels like it. Housed in a somewhat hastily converted cheesy nightclub (complete with a sparkly orange bar top), the decor isn't going to win any awards, but the food just might.",1
k-XN0KuOWPU5xZlfXOVSlA,"I got the pho here and it was REALLY good. The crew and I went in with low expectations, but I was blown away! To me, it tastes pretty authentic; the broth was flavorful, you are given the typical side of bean sprouts, jalapenos and lime, and they even put rare meat in like they do at Vietnamese places! Overall it was a very, very satisfying meal. 

The atmosphere is great, especially at night when the weather is warm and breezy and you're sitting at a table next to the open window wall. I was here around 10pm on a Saturday when there were not many people in the restaurant. Staff is very friendly and accommodated splitting our checks by order. 

I am definitely coming back here the next time I visit Case Western.",1
k-XN0KuOWPU5xZlfXOVSlA,"I've been to this restaurant 3 times since their opening mid-August and I really can't complain about the food. It's flavorful and I've enjoyed every bite. Granted that their ramen isn't as authentic as I'd like it to be but like one reviewer said, this is Cleveland and it's definitely better than what is currently being offered around town.

The reason for the 4 stars is their service (though the servers are all really nice). They just opened so I'm giving them time to iron out their kinks but I hope to God they smooth it out soon. I went to lunch with a friend today and after we were seated, it took the server 30 minutes to come back to us to get our orders. We had to flag her down repeatedly before she finally saw us and I could tell that she had forgotten that she had a table waiting for their orders to be taken.  

So by all means, make your way down to the restaurant. the food really is good but if you come during the busy times, be prepared to wait. I hope you figure out your service dilemma, ninja kitchen, because you have a good thing going there.",0
k-XN0KuOWPU5xZlfXOVSlA,"I was really excited to try this place as the idea of the restaurant seemed really cool. However, the food was a failure. You'd expect that the food would be better since an asian chef is cooking it. NOT. 

I tried the green papaya salad (hated it), bacon guacamole (eh it was interesting), chili garlic wings (could do without, didn't like the sauce), spring roll noodle bowl (so bland. this dish has some serious identity crisis), bacon and egg ramen (let me explain further). 

Do not try this ramen if you've tried authentic japanese ramen before. It's terrible. It has absolutely no flavor and the noodles are off. You would have to pay me money to eat this ramen. Luckily it's only 8 bucks. I just have a high standard for ramen noodles because I've tried restaurants in LA, NY, Chicago, and DC.",0
k-XN0KuOWPU5xZlfXOVSlA,"Fiance and I came here for lunch while walking back from Case Western to our hotel since it was on the way back. We were hoping for something light because we were planning on having sushi later that day. 

It seems like your typical bar downstairs, but they have some seating arrangements upstairs. Ambiance was super casual, but it was also really loud because the music echos throughout the place. The ordering system was a bit confusing because instead of a menu and placing your order with the server, you mark down what you want with pencils that are provided to you (as you would do in some sushi joints), and hand the papers over to the server when he comes by with your drinks. Otherwise, not much explanation.

Fiance got a bento box with Tom Yum Soup, the Spicy Shrimp Quesadilla, and the Bacon Guacamole. I got to try his Tom Yum Soup; he wasn't too fond of it because it was more sour (?) than than what he normally associates with Tom Yum Soup. He was expecting spice, not sour. I suspect it was too much lime in the lime broth. He said he enjoyed the Shrimp Quesadilla, but that the guacamole wasn't anything special. I got a bento box with the Pork Rangoons, Chili Garlic Wings, and the Shrimp Quesadilla. To me, the shrimp quesadilla was fine (mostly cheese, less shrimp). The Pork Rangoons were delightfully crunchy and stuffed full of pork, and the dipping sauce helped with the heaviness. Probably my favorite thing so far. I was a bit disappointed with the Chili Garlic Wings, because the description on the menu says it's crispy and jumbo, but I thought they were pretty typical and not so crispy. The way it was described, it seemed as if it would have the Korean fried chicken feel, but it definitely wasn't. Actually, that being said, none of the food really felt authentically Asian. Maybe that's their concept, but I wasn't feeling it.

That being said, prices were pretty reasonable. However, one disappointing aspect was that our food took quite a while. Maybe it was because it was after the lunch rush, but there was only one other party of four upstairs with us and we both waited quite a while for our food.

tl;dr average food, somewhat of a wait for service. Bento box lets you try multiple things on the menu. Favorite was the Pork Rangoon.",0
KXqOT3vyx8Ao7com4yST-g,"Food is good! But the servers are stingy, and everything is extra. It is not authentic indian food and i would like to see more options perhaps paneer. But overall decent stop.",0
KXqOT3vyx8Ao7com4yST-g,"This place used to be so good. I would frequent about 3-4 times a week bc it was so good. Over the last 6 months they have hired in management that is more than incompetent. They constantly don't have ingredients made and are unwilling to make them upon request. They've cut their portion sizes in half including all of the sides. I haven't had a warm meal there in probably at least 4 months. It's always like warm and mushy and just feels gross in your mouth. Everything they have on their board for you to order from is wrong and typically doesn't display the correct prices either. I'm not even cashing in my 200 belly points for two free bowls bc I don't want to eat there again, it's gotten that bad. I had to wait over 35 minutes for them to fry 1 veggie cutlet even though the board says two and I was charged for 2 and told that they were sorry about my luck. Don't go here. Find an authentic Indian place because this is terrible.  I've also tried to reach out to the management personally with no response at all to my issues.",0
l1ug2BtaafDvHpr3JEmbAQ,"When I first walked in, the restaurant was so cute and small that I thought I was about to get flawlessly tasty authentic Mexican food. My expectations were not met though.

I thought the food was just pretty bland and the meat was so tough that I could barely eat it. 

The pupusas were the best part of the meal, and I wish that I hadn't ordered anything else because they were really good.

l1ug2BtaafDvHpr3JEmbAQ,"La Casa Tazumal is right off Lorain on W 105th in a sleepy part of town with street parking. The outside isn't hard to miss, with a jungle creeping in the windows near the entrance. After entering the double doors, you're greeted to some Spanish Christian literature and a cozy dining area with plastic table clothes, food paintings and a booth selling herbal remedies.

Like others have said, the restaurant is run by an elderly woman with lots of spirit and seemingly fluent English. The menu is two pages, with a third page for dessert and miscellaneous a la carte items. Horchata and tamarindo is fresh and delicious, like dessert in a glass ($1.25).

I suppose the main draw here are the Salvadorean pupusas, which resemble Colombian arepas. Corn tortillas are split and stuffed with pork, beef, beans, cheese and other goodies. La Casa Tazumal's are slightly greasy, but definitely filling. For around $1.50 each, you can eat your fill of pupusas without denting your wallet.

We ate in the dining area, and the chef's daughter came half-way through and became our waitress in place of her mom. She brought out some pickled cabbage and other vegetables and a wonderful hot sauce. My boyfriend had a tamale, pupusas and empanada, although he had to pack up the empanada. Two pupusas and the horchata filled me up. We also ordered plantanos frito (fried plantain - $2.50). I thought it was going to be deep fried, sort of like yoyos or something, but it was a plantain, split down the center and caramelized. It was sweet and satisfying, but a little heavy for dessert. We packed it up for later.

La Casa Tazumal offers a lot of character and great, seemingly authentic Salvadorean cuisine. With many other menu options we didn't try, and a woman who's a triumph for opening her own restaurant and keeping a sweet demeanor the entire visit, we'll definitely be back again. This place could become a weekly staple.",1
l1ug2BtaafDvHpr3JEmbAQ,Great authentic El salvadorian cuisine. Best in town! Small quaint restaurant ran by an extremely friendly El salvadorian lady with an atmosphere that reminds me of San Salvador. I have been coming here for several yeas and will continue to come back every time I visit my parents in Cleveland.,1
l1ug2BtaafDvHpr3JEmbAQ,I love authentic ethnic food and I am so glad I found this place in my City.  This is like going into someone's house and having a meal from the soul.  The Pupusas are just so damned good!  I seriously think you are missing out if you don't have a meal here.  I had a tamale and just cried when thinking about how much I spent to have a designer tamale at El Carnicero.  A must eat.,1
L7txS44bvz862djgTOim9w,"food is decent but over priced. a bahn mi sandwhich ranged from 12-14 dollars. you seriously have to be crazy to pay that much for one sandwhich....really they cost at least 5 bucks. if you want authentic food, I spend money at a hole in the wall.",0
L7txS44bvz862djgTOim9w,"I went here with a friend from out of town and it was excellent. I've passed it a number of times and heard good things so I'm really glad that I finally checked it out.
We got the chicken steam buns and they were so delicious. It seemed pretty authentic and also very trendy- the presentation of everything was really great.

The cocktails are all really fun- I recommend the lychee martini. We got the pad thai and shrimp quesadillas, which were both good. I saw a bunch of people who got the huge bowls of noodle soup and I can see that happening in my near future as it gets colder.

This doesn't seem like the kind of place that you'd need a reservation at because it's not super fancy, but by the time we were leaving it definitely got pretty crowded so I was glad that we missed the wait.",1

I would recommend trying something different if you want it to taste authentic.",0
L7txS44bvz862djgTOim9w,"Just got back from Bac, it is not what it use to be anymore. I have been here 3x the last 9 months and was hoping I just had one bad meal. It actually been all terrible culinary cultural experiences.
It was bland, meat was smoky/charred.. like the grill or pan was burned and they continued to cook on that burned pan. Sauce was bland, I don't know what happened to the cook. It's not authentic anymore and the noodles are not even cooked well. They can't even get the spring rolls right. Noodles are hard inside the spring roll and the vegetables were not fresh.  The pad thai was bland, noodles were soggy, overcooked, and chicken tasted burned charr. The noodle salad was bland, sauce was bland, meat was burned/charred. The dinner tonight was inedible. The wait staff was slow even though there was only 3 tables outside with 2 waiters. They were inattentive. I'm sad that I won't be back here again because I live so close to Bac now.  


Bac use to be my go to.. not anymore. Very sad!",0
L7txS44bvz862djgTOim9w,"We came here for a date night yesterday, and it was quite delicious. The drink menu was neat, my fiance ordered a ginger pear drink made with whisky that he loved. We arrived at a weird time, it was not busy when we sat down, but as soon as we did, about 10 other tables (including a table of 8-10) all sat down within the next 10 minutes. And thats just what we saw from outside. So, it took a while to be served at first, but understandably so. After that, service was prompt and friendly. I like that this place has a lot of vegetarian options and modifications and they truly cater to dietary restrictions.  My fiance ordered a vegetarian pad thai and i ordered the lo mein. Both were delicious and a TON of food. We also ordered vegetarian spring rolls to start. All of it was delicious with good flavor. The only thing i thought was a little weird were the lo mein noodles. They were essentially ramen noodles. It was still delicious, just not the type of noodle i was expecting and craving. Maybe this is more authentic, I'm ignorant on that subject. Like i said, still really good and the tofu was done well. And i had enough leftover for at least 2 more dinners..",1
L7txS44bvz862djgTOim9w,"Vietnamese noodle salad is typically a light, flavorful, delightful dish, one of my favorite meals. Bac's version can only be described as aggressively bland. 

The restaurant is almost next door to my new apartment, & I was thrilled to have a new engine we go to within such close proximity. Unfortunately, they don't sell pork buns, another one of my favorites, on their lunch menu, so I grabbed pick-up one night for an early dinner. The pork buns, $9, were very good - fresh, complex, topped with some sort of spicy aioli. I was pleased - off to a good start! 

Unfortunately, the noodle salad - which I had been dreaming about since moving into the area - was a major letdown. It tasted like... nothing at all. The beef was thinly sliced, just the way I like it, & it appeared to be cooked in all the right ways, but just it didn't seem to be seasoned at all. The sauce, which had leaked all over the container & slimed the whole salad, had no flavor whatsoever - none of that light, salty taste that should top of salad like this. And though the dill carrots were a nice addition, they certainly couldn't make up for the lack of flavor in the rest of the dish. I considered saving my leftovers for lunch the next day, but it was so unappealing, taste-wise, but I just threw it away. Waste of food, waste of money, waste of an opportunity to make a really great dish.

In all, my meal cost me $28 (I left a smaller tip because it was a carry-out order). I'd much rather go to an authentic, hole-in-the-wall Vietnamese joint where I can get noodle salad that tastes three times better for one third of the price. 

If Bac sold pork buns on their lunch menu, I would probably go back for those - but they don't, so I won't. Bummer.",0
L7txS44bvz862djgTOim9w,"The food is definitely not authentic, but I loved everything about this place. I came here with a group for my friends birthday. It was a larger group so we had a reservation and were seated right away. It was a Saturday night and they were really busy, which made the restaurant very loud, almost annoyingly so. 

The service was great and the waiter was really knowledgeable about everything on the menu. I got the basil fried rice, which I loved, and almost everyone else got pad thai (I know, how predictable) which they raved about. The portions were huge but everything was priced very reasonably. My favorite thing about this place is how many options there were for each dish. I'm vegetarian so having options like tofu is always appreciated, and delicious.",1
L7txS44bvz862djgTOim9w,"If you're looking for some authentic Asian food, it's definitely not here. However, this place has some very delicious Asian fusion food! 

Here are some things I tried: 
- The sweet potato fries appetizers are one of a kind! Rather than being your typical crispy fries, these have chunks of fried flour on them. I know this sounds kind of weird, but it was really good! The sauce that came with it had a hint of ginger and tangerine. Yummy! 
- The papaya salad appetizer was very, very delicious! It had a sweet and sour flavor, topped with some chunks of peanuts. Very refreshing! The portion size was also very generous.
- The kim chi noodles dish was very unique! The dish came with glass noodles, which perfectly accentuated the taste of the kimchi :) I ordered it with the chicken, and the taste was simply perfection. The portion size was also humongous! Definitely worth the $14 I paid for it. 

Overall, I was very pleased with this restaurant. The servers were very friendly. The cook/owner (?) even came around our table to make sure everything was all right :) You can also tell that they put a lot of effort into making their restaurant unique, with the many interesting decor. I think this place is definitely worth a try! Be prepared to drop at least $20/person though! The dishes can get pretty pricey.",1
L7txS44bvz862djgTOim9w,"Ok my extreme bias is going to show because this is a family member of mine and I'm so proud of what he's done.  However, if I didn't think the place was up to standard I just would not review it.  Bac is an Asian Fusion restaurant with lots of Vietnamese influence.  Vietnamese food is what I grew up eating and is my comfort food so this place has everything that I need.  The coconut crepe is crispy on the outside and filled with mung bean, pork and mini shrimp on the inside.  Served with that Vietnamese staple, fish sauce, it's delicious.  Same with the green papaya salad with fish sauce, pickled veggies and lime... delicious.  The banh mi contains just enough of those unidentifiable ingredients to make it authentic and is served on a thin, toasted French baguette.  The crab cakes taste mostly of crab and non of that unwanted filler.  The pad thai is sweet and full of flavor.  
The drinks are also amazing, each containing some sort of Asian flair like the lychee-tini or my favorite the saigon latte, with a base of the french pressed coffee and condensed milk (which is ridiculously good on it's own) and liquoring it up, delicious.
The space is bright and calming and the servers extremely friendly.  Friday was opening night so it's not perfect yet and everyone's getting used to each other but with time it's going to be a Tremont staple and a good place to go for some Vietnamese comfort food.  (Yes they do have pho but I have  not had a chance to try it yet, but I can tell you  at family functions it's always delicious)",1

Fresh authentic flavors, it seems like the chef really puts his heart into this place and it shows. I tried the Pad Thai, was so delicious, it was flavorful, and like i said this was my first dive into a new food and i was thoroughly impressed by how good it was. Also tried the KImchi noodles, again it was a flavor explosion in my mouth! Service was a bit slow, and there was not too many people when i visited so im not sure what the hold up was but all was forgiven when i actually got my food. Great bar and cocktails, perfect for a date night. 

its a little on the expensive side, but i totally get why, the seasonings and ingredients BAC uses in their food is authentic which must be costly for them so all in all its worth the price hike. I recommend this place if you're in the mood for some good vietnamese/pan asian food.!",1
L7txS44bvz862djgTOim9w,Pan asian fare in Tremont.  The chicken wings were great.  The delicious walnut shrimp were breaded in tempura.

L7txS44bvz862djgTOim9w,"Bac Restaurant is a new asian bistro and bar that has a lot to offer for all palettes from the vegetarian to the meat lover. To start off, I ordered the gyozas, which I enjoyed alot because they were handmade, while most asian restaurants use frozen dumplings. For my entree, I ordered the curry has a very authentic flavor and spice, and they offer a variety of meats. It has a very chilled out atmosphere perfect for hanging out with friends or taking a date. People I had dinner with could not get enough of the lycheetini and tokyopolitan (I believe that's what it is called). The layout of the place also allows for you to enjoy yourself in a relaxing bar (big too), and the subtle hints of greens brings a very southeast asian flair to the place. The dining area was relaxing and presented very well. Overall, Bac is a great place with a bright future.",1

It's an easy choice because it's casual, fast and inexpensive and there's something on the menu for everyone. The service is always good and I have never had a complaint about the food except for the fish tacos I ordered last year, which were a disappointment. I try to get something different every time I'm there . Si Senor provides generous portions and the food is to the table quickly. This is not authentic Mexican food.

It was very good but the menu stated it came with 4 tortilla shells but you only get three and they are half the size of a normal shell about 4 in in diameter and you only get 3. When I asked for another , I was charged 1.50 extra for it ! Also my boyfriend asked for a little extra sourcream and was also charged extra for that!.  They say its authentic but their rice has little flavor. When we received our bill it was just a old adding machine tape with numbers. Nothing was itemized and no customer copy available.  So ridiculous.  We will think twice before eating there again.",0
L-Go77QiXmXsYt9dYULPww,"Hate to be a party pooper, but this place is very run of the mill Tex Mex.  It's not bad. I have had much worse Mexican. But by no means is it authentic or exceptional here.

L-Go77QiXmXsYt9dYULPww,"I love 'authentic' Mexican - better known as cheap and quickly served Mexican.  But this place is below par to it's competitors.  While there is never a wait which is really nice, I think there is a reason for that. 

So it's Mexican - of course when I go I want a Margarita.  I would say they are just average?  I barely taste the tequila and I barely taste the flavor I choose of the day?  And there are never any pitcher or daily specials.  *(maybe they are but then my server never tells me about them). 

Then the food.  It's not bad, but I have definitely experienced better.  Things seem to be flavorless and WAY OVERPRICED.  I order a la carte items a lot because usually it is a night before the bars or I am more going for the drinks, chips and the company.  The a la carte taco's are huge!!!! but again flavorless.  

If I have a choice I would pick a competitor but if I am going out in West Park I can deal - I just wish the staff was more fun and friendly and the food and drinks gave me a little more flavor.",0

The smell of pee from Kilbanes is gone wich is a nice touch!  The food was OK, margaritas had very little booze in em.  Service was super slow but salsa was good.

L-Go77QiXmXsYt9dYULPww,"By far my favorite local Mexican restaurant on the west side!  I love that Si Senor is local, and family owned, that's what makes extra delicious.  The food is fresh and authentic.  

Specials are their specialty!  Whether you want Taco Tuesday or Tortas on Monday, they have something for everyone.  I love that I can still order off the lunch menu for dinner, only a $1 upcharge.

Tonight we had margaritas and daiquiris, chips and salsa, guacamole and dinner...too much food as usual, but you are always served like family at Si Senor.  I always go for the huevos rancheros, I'm a sucker for the ranchero sauce!  My husband ordered the quesadilla special, it was as large as the plate.  

Sometimes there is a wait, but it's always worth it. Did I mention they have a patio, just wait until the weather breaks in the spring.

My Philly steak sandwhich was just okay.  The beef was seasoned well, but there wasn't enough of it.  I know authentic Philly cheese steaks DO come wit Cheese Wiz or wit out it, and this Philly is true to that heritage.  However, I don't really like Cheese Wiz and I love mushrooms, onions, and peppers.  Wish this sandwich had a different cheese and more veggies.  Otherwise, pretty good.

the restaurant contacted me and asked for a second chance. It's been about 3 years since my first review, so probably a lot had changed. To be clear, they offered me a gift card to come back and try them again

Stopped in there today around 1:30 and the place was packed.  I sat at the bar and was just one person, so can't really make a judgment call on table service.  I will say the bartenders were very busy but they were friendly, quick to serve and very attentive despite that.  There were only one or two open spots at the bar.  The food was good.  I had the order of 3 chicken tacos on corn tortillas.  Unlike a lot of other places, the corn tortillas didn't soak all the way through and come apart by the time I got to the last one.  They were pretty wet at the bottom, but still held together.  Served with an order of home made tortilla chips and some salsa.  They also had some sort of Mexican flavor I recognized as authentic from my trips to Mexico but couldn't put my finger on what it was.  On the way out I cruised by the crepe station.  They looked pretty awesome.  Apparently at least on Sat. afternoon they have that going all afternoon.  You walk up, look at all the great selections of stuff they have out in small bowls on the table to put on your crepe and they will make it up to order.  Bottom line, I would go back again based on this experience.  In addition to their beer list being quite extensive they had 3 flavors on nitro.

old review from 2013 - was at 2 stars then

Stopped in this new place for a couple of drinks this afternoon. Cocktails were pretty mediocre, kind of watered down tasting. Service was a little frosty too. Other people's food looked good (entres), but the cupcake and bar nuts (croutons and sugared nuts) were pretty meh.
the shakes looked pretty killer though.
To the other reviewer that says this is as good as it gets in Cleveland, go across the street to the Beer Markt (we drive up from Buffalo just for the sunny side pizza and amazing beer menu) or down the street to the Black Pig. The Flying Fig also has much better cocktails than here.
The decor and vibe are really nice though.",0

LNsZJP6jZ11e0tDljOLPiQ,"When I told Lauren K that I was in the midst of Whole30 her plans for a delicious, authentic pierogi lunch were squashed. Good thing she's quick on her feet and we re-routed our hangry pains for Townhall. 

I'm not surprised that this modern, hipster place does so well. The menu is deep with options for any taste preferences. Whether you're vegan, gluten free, or just angling for an incredible lamb burger and fries, there's something here for you. The servers were also very friendly and helpful, being sure to ask about any dietary restrictions/modifications even after ordering. 

After perusing the menu, I went with the tuna poke cold bowl and the greengo juice. The tuna itself was just ok, I've had far better raw tuna, but the flavors combos with the sauce, zucchini noodles, radishes, and avocado were nice and bright. My greengo juice was the star of my lunch, though. It had just enough heat to pack a punch without being an inferno. The spirulina, pineapple, jalapeno, and cilantro melded into one hell of a fresh juice. 

I applaud Townhall for catering to those with strict dietary preferences/requirements...it ain't easy eating clean!",1
LNsZJP6jZ11e0tDljOLPiQ,"People who love Town Hall are wrong.  It's a gross, artificial, poorly executed approximation of authenticity.  It's a bro bar disguised as a craft experience.  
I ate breakfast there when they first opened -- kitchen had no idea what it was doing.  Rubbery bacon and horribly overcooked eggs arrived after about 35 minutes of waiting (which followed a 20-minute wait to be acknowledged by our server), even though the place was nearly empty.
Had to go back for a lunch meeting a few months later... the ginger in my fried rice dish hadn't been properly chopped, so there were long, cat-hair-like fibers throughout the dish that caught in my throat and literally choked me as I tried to eat.  AMATEUR HOUR.  
If you want a better version of what this restaurant purports to be, go to Plum on Lorain.  If you want to go to a bar that just has good food and good beer, go to Stone Mad in Gordon Square.

Lo_kU1f3Jd1qCQNrUVeo_w,Savory crepe was delicious. Sweet crepe was overmixed and tough like a quesadilla. Such a shame because the attitude was authentically French but the food was not. I would not recommend waiting 45 minutes like we did.,0
Lo_kU1f3Jd1qCQNrUVeo_w,"The Crepe deserves 10 stars - it's as good as street crepes in Paris. It's the only one in North America which is.

The service deserves minus 10. They're about as joyous as Thom Yorke Radiohead trapped in a Medieval Torture Device during a family bereavement.

""Crepes"" by Radiohead

When you were here before
The servers wouldn't look you in the eye
They don't act like angels
And they make you cry
They ruffle your feathers
They live in a gloomy world
They think they're so special
They're so f***ing special

But they have crepes!
And you're a weirdo!
That's why you keep coming here!
Even though they treat you wrong here

I sang that out loud last time I was here. You should have seen the dirty Luxe I got.

I'm giving them a 5 star rating despite them having the worst service - perhaps that I've ever experienced. And if you have a problem with that, I don't give a crepe.

It's one of the worst customer service experiences of my life, but it's also the best crepe in North America, so I'm giving it a 5 when they deserve a huge 0 (a zero, not an O, no way) for the enormity of their attitude problems.

What to get: Crepe with sugar and lemon. That's it. Nothing fancy. Trust me bae.
What not to get: Angry when they treat you like a pile of horse sh**.

These kind of Luxe might not be for Lorde, but they're absolutely for me. I'd say (and there is some decent competition in Philly and Indy among other places) that this is the best Crepe I've had in the USA. It's the most similar to France. Shame about the sh** service though.

What a contradiction. We're talking about probably the best crepe and found in North America. I would know. I love this sh**. I go to France for this sh**. I know which alley in Paris the very best and most moist (moistmost) can be found in. I am the sh** when it comes to knowing sh** about which crepes are the sh**. Most Americans (I'm British, and we like talking sh**) grow up on sh** bland sh** crepes so they wouldn't know the sh**ting difference, would they? Like sh** they would.

So these are the most authentic and traditional and true to the style of France. I think whoever started making these must have visited France a good number of times because this is almost the way they taste on the streets of Paris. Get it with nothing but sugar and lemon. That's the French way. In addition to being hairy and thin and making out a lot. With more than church tongue.

On the other hand, we're talking about some of the worst service imaginable. I mean I've had so many bad service experiences here I don't even want to go into most of them. I can think of 5. I'll just tell you about one.

Most recently I stood in line for about 10 minutes - about 5 minutes before closing - and they refused to give me a crepe. They weren't remotely nice or apologetic. I explained I was only in town from Buffalo once every 6 months, and that I'd just stood in line for 10 min, and there were still 5 mins to go. And they were passively aggressively complaining about people being in their line close to closing time and saying things like (loudly) such as ""I hope those people don't think they're actually going to get served"" and ""don't you just love when people feel entitled to get served after we're closed.""

It wasn't just one or two comments. They were loudly giving sarcastic crap to their customers (particularly me) for a good few minutes, all the way not actually telling me directly, sorry, we're closed, come back tomorrow. They waited until the clock had ticked to closing time for that. Hmm, how convenient.

I've written what, 5,000 reviews? Near enough. I don't think I've ever been served by people quite this rude. And consistently so. It's definitely in my 5 most offensive and ugly customer service experiences.

So They get -5 stars for massive customer service problems and horrendous attitudes and treating their customers like sh**.

On the other hand I'm basing my actual rating only on the taste of the wonderful Crepes so it gets 5 Stars although I do so with a heavy heart because they are absolutely awful to their customers particularly me but it's happened so often that it probably happens to others too and I bet they'd have way better ratings if they were even remotely nice or fair to the people paying for their products run on sentences ftw amirite.

Anyway if you read this far, thanks for giving a crepe.",0

LtDYRcMJbJPhXPEklT29Fw,"Best Cleveland restaurant to open in a while! It sits in Shaker Square, and is staffed by ""front of the house"" and ""back of the house"" workers, some of who are transitioning from incarceration to a career in the food industry.  Heading it all up is Brandon Chrostowski, well known from L'Albatros, and his knowledge of food and service clearly shows! The food is supposedly ""Industrial French"", and while I don't know what that means, let's just leave it at this: exceptional cooking in traditional French style with an authenticity that is hard to beat! The lobster bisque is a delight, the braised artichokes are yummy, and I loved the strip steak and frites!  My steak was cooked perfectly and the pepper sauce was excellent. Mild complaint was that the fries were not as crisp as I normally like. My friend had the ""Paupiettes de poisson"", a grouper wrapped in crispy, thin sliced potatoes in a delightful sauce. I had a delightful bite of that as well, and the fish was moist and the dish succeeds. 
The restaurant has just opened so there were some rough bits to iron out; however, the overall sense that one gets is that the staff is well trained, and the kitchen is well run. My only quibble is with the ""by the glass"" wine list, which seems to be a work in progress. 
The decor is very refined and they have done a great job with the space. A cheese cart paraded by a few times and looked to have a varied selection.
Finally, I should add that the restaurant is part of an ""institute/foundation"" so that your bill comes as a contribution to a 501 (c) and is tax deductible!!!
I'll definitely be back!!",1

We made a reservation the day of, and were seated near the fireplace, which we particularly enjoy, as we equate the ambiance with many of our home-cooked dinners enjoyed lengthily, fireplace side. I ordered two appetizers for dinner in order to be able to fully appreciate a diverse plate of cheese. The delicate taste and texture of the escargots, which I only ate at my grandfather's table when I was a child, brought me back years. Memories of foraging in the woods, looking for snails under certain plants' leaves after the rain came back with the aroma of the dish. The perfectly cooked pan-seared duck foie-gras with a pear and armagnac sweet and savory accompaniment was both original and classic. My husband very much enjoyed the pappardelle with ox tail stew, daube  la Provengale style. The cheese platter is astoundingly well composed. The wine list is very personal, yet extremely flexible to allow  pairings with any dish combination. The wine-by-the-glass list surpasses any I have seen in restaurants with a very savvy taste in wine and suggestions of astute pairings. Last but not least for the gastronomic side of things, the bread is simply delicious, plain and fresh with a beautiful dark crust and slightly caramelized crumb (pain de campagne style). My highest compliments to the baker who does not rush the rising process.  
Concerning the service, the pride and delight servers and table attendants take in making your experience as enjoyable and unique as possible is heartwarming in the highest degree. The atmosphere is relaxed and joyful, yet wonderfully a propos, as it is devoid of the borderline stuffiness one could expect in this country anytime French food is involved.

While the service was great and I got my food quickly, it just didn't taste up to par. I can't say the interior decor did very much for it either. The bright whiteness of it made me a little uncomfortable; this could be a ""judge a book by its cover"" situation, but I kind of expected and would have believed in this place a little more if I had found some authentic looking decorations. I do support the whole ""industrial"" and ""modern"" look, but it felt more like a frozen yogurt joint than a sushi restaurant.

LWk7Q5CTjpK-k_TfXdbApQ,"Similar to cafeteria food on the salad bar, nothing really to talk about there. The meat smorgasbord was overwhelming in volume and very underwhelming in flavor and preparation. Most all of the meats were overcooked. A few that had a chance were not seasoned. This was my first visit to a place like this and while the service was excellent, we felt shorted on value for price. The sides served on the table were rice, a vinegar salsa, and fries with breaded and deep fried bananas. Plantains would have been more authentic and not hard to prepare. Save your money.",0
LWk7Q5CTjpK-k_TfXdbApQ,"All-you-can-eat grilled meat for ~$50 including tip, without dessert or drinks.  I've been to a few Brazilian steakhouses in several big cities.  The experience at a Brazilian steakhouse is always amazing, but compared to the other places I've been to, I would say that Brasa is average.

Meat choices range from chicken legs and pork sausages to various cuts of steak.  I thought the leg of lamb was particularly good.  Lamb served in cheaper restaurants often has a gamy taste, which often keeps me from ordering it.  The leg of lamb at Brasa was seasoned and cooked well enough for me not to notice any gamy taste. In terms of steak, you have your choice between cuts of filet mignon, flank steak, and sirloin. I feel that I've had higher quality cuts of beef at other Brazilian steakhouses.

There could also be some improvement in terms of the salad bar and side dishes.  While the fried plantains were good, they were accompanied with french fries.  At other Brazilian steakhouses, I've had other more authentic sides to go with the meat.  The bread served was mediocre. I thought the salad bar could have had more variety, considering that you can have the salad bar only for a slightly lower price. On a positive note, there are quite a few seafood entrees available in the ""buffet area"", including an abundance of crab legs, stuffed mussels, and cocktail shrimp.

All in all, if you've been to another Brazilian steakhouse before, you may not be wowed.  The experience will still be enjoyable though.  If you haven't been to a Brazilian steakhouse and love meat, you will definitely have a good time.",0

Mb4V2aPneclZZ8BfZUjWGA,"A two-star review for Ken Stewart's East Bank may seem harsh, but given the price tag for what may very well be the current most expensive restaurant in Cleveland, the sub-par grade is more than justifiable.  I gave Ken Stewart's a chance to reach for the stars, getting the ""True Japanese 100% Wagyu Beef from Kagoshima, Japan.""  (With that many guarantees of authenticity in the title, how could you go wrong?)  I've only had imported steak from Japan once before, at Jean-Georges Vongerichten's Prime in the Bellagio Las Vegas, and it remains one of my fondest steak memories to date.  Ken Stewart's failed to provide even a shadow of that previous wagyu experience:  While the fat content is there, the marbling was not nearly as evenly spread throughout the cut.  And instead of that unreal feeling of the dispersed fat melting on your tongue, you're left with just sad, thinly-sliced cross-sections of fairly fatty but rather unremarkable meat.  Similarly disappointing, while the menu lists a lobster add-on for $20, the server politely explained that the add-on was simply some cut-up chunks of lobster put on the plate, but a lobster tail add-on was available for $40.  I would strongly discourage any future diners from taking up this offer--the tail came out overcooked, destroying any of the delicate sweetness of the lobster meat.  On top of that, the tail was served without any clarified butter, a pretty glaring omission for a high-end restaurant.

What makes the Ken Stewart's experience even more egregious is that less than two weeks later I visited the new downtown Red location ordering many of the same things (substituting a USDA Prime aged ribeye for the Kogashima wagyu).  In every respect, with every dish, Red was superior--particularly with the larger, tastier, and substantially more reasonably-priced poached lobster tail add-on--at what amounted to two-thirds of the price of Ken Stewart's.",0
Mb4V2aPneclZZ8BfZUjWGA,"ken stewart goes north
to awaken the east bank
river renaissance

The Powerhouse is on the west bank, but the east bank stirs to life after all these years with none other than its own powerhouse, Ken Stewart, veteran restaurateur throwing down hard with a new spot in the flats.  And it takes a veteran pro to come out this strong from the gate. Personally, I have a lot of respect for that, as opposed to places that open with excuses of being ""new"" and still charge full prices.  For those, I have no tolerance.  

Walking in, we were greeted by the entire Stewart family.  Nice!  Ken, big personality and consummate professional, showed us to the bar area.  The bar is a stunner.  Colorful, comfortable, and a solid inventory.  No soda guns, but small bottles of soda, ginger ale and the like. What a HUGE difference that makes.  A very nice cocktail list, and well trained bartenders to make them. A hat tip to bartender Molly, who made me a perfectly balanced bourbon/lemon/basil cocktail that was truly a delight. Full flavor spectrum, with the basil top-note being a nuance, and not a hammer. Also, the herb was not muddled into an oblivion that gets all caught up in your teeth.

We had a few appetizers that were exceptional, along with a small, cast iron pan of traditional ""Parker house"" rolls that I could eat all day. Our mussels came in a light curry broth that those rolls proved a perfect vessel for.  Very, very good.
We also had Hamachi sashimi that was fresh, and all in all, outstanding.  I wished for a few more slices, but it is perfect example of quality over quantity.  Actually, it was just the right amount.
My personal favorite was the steak tartar.  Actually, a simple dish that when properly executed is beef heaven. If it is on the menu, I usually order it. I've had it in NYC's Le Halle, and it made me sad.  I had it in various Chicago restaurants, and when I found a good one, I could not get it made the same way twice in a row. The Greenhouse Tavern here in Cleveland does a rock solid tartar, and that makes me happy.  
But the tartar at East Bank is special. Coarsely ground prime beef topped with a perfect egg yolk, served simply and traditionally, with toast points, capers, and onions, this was, by far, the best tartar I ever had. 

I'm looking forward to dinner here.  I don't think I'll be ordering a steak anywhere else, as the beef here starts with U.S. Prime, and works its way up to Japanese Wagyu, complete with individual steer certification. Get this.  The certificate of authenticity includes a nose print.  On the certificate. And probably a full DNA profile as well.  

This place is a game changer for Cleveland Steakhouses, and can hang with any of the heavy hitters anywhere. 
Bravo.

Carry on...",1
mbk0WvEjeVXUEckUq5D1BQ,"I work within walking distance, so I have been here many of times. Located in the Hyatt Arcarde, there are several other choices close by but this is my favorite. I'm not being byass because I'm greek, I'm being honest because they are friendly and authentic. The owners do operate this business and they are always eager to assist and happy to help with suggestions. 

The gyro's are pretty good. Their not from the shawarma, but they are still good in their own right. I do enjoy their tahini sauce, I get it on everything. Not too garlickey, which is a nice touch since I go on my lunch and wouldn't be able to eat it if it was. The salmon (Friday lunch special) is good also. The chicken kabob is all white meat chicken, I get the spicy and then have them add curry sauce and tahini sauce and load it into my pita and I'm in heaven. The rice, not my favorite. I substitute for the greek salad with real feta, which makes everything betta. 

Based on the low $5 price tag, the quality of food, the friendliness, cleanliness and the quickness, this place is a five star establishment all day. Thank me later.",1
MBpTl3womA9RRX4ruce78w,"Really has a mom n pop, family owned feel to it. The employees are always friendly and helpful. 

The fresh produce is excellent. I really enjoy their selection of quality lunch meats and cheeses in the deli too. I have also tried several of their prepared soups and hot foods which are like tasty home-cooked comfort food.

Chuppa's is quite a gem in Parma.",1
Md6NWl54ny8hA-NVaYZuew,"Nighttown could be a better place only if they had better servers. We usually take away from Nighttown and also sat there to eat a couple of times.
You may have an impression that I dislike this restaurant but all I am going to write is a honest truth, my own experience and actual events. Afterall, I do like this restaurant.

1. Dine in or Pick up?
Definitely Dine in is better. Ordering for pick-up can cause you a little trouble.
Let's say, out of 2 times I ordered for pick up in last 2 months, it didn't go smoothly.
One time, we ordered steamed clams and Bloom'd Burger for pick up.
When we got home and opened those boxes, we saw everything was incredibly wrong.
We clearly asked for clams over the phone,(because one of my family members have an allergy by eating mussels) but they gave us mussels and also charged us $3 extra for the mussels. 
For the burger, all I got in the box was buns, patty, cheese and french fries.
There were no lettuce, tomato, kechup, mustard or any kind of condiment. And the burger was $11.95. 

As soon as we called them, the waitress/bartender told us that they had run out of clams so cooked with mussels. 
Then, why didn't she say so when I showed up at the restaurant for pickup?
Not only they did not have a decency to tell us, but also charged us extra $3, which I did not ask for.

Another time when i got to the place to pickup the food, the waitress told me they had run out of the dish... Not again!! really. So my order was not ready.  

***All they have to do is knowing what is available what is not in the kitchen. All they could have done is to take customers phone number to call us back in case like such.
It is little too much since I've never experienced such thing from any other restaurants. 
Obviously the kitchen staff and the servers are not communicating well and also they are not doing good job at inventory management if they have to tell customers ""we ran out"" so many times every time.

2. Food quality
When we dined in the restaurant, it was exellent. 
($5 Burger) They have this burger deal for $5 if you sit and eat at the bar. It is incredibly worth your money. You can even add grilled onions with extra $1.5.
(Pancetta Shrimp) is very very tasty, loving this dish, although it is $13 for an appetizer.
(Quiche du Jour) is a real mediocre dish. Don't expect an authentic french quiche, because it is not. It simply lacks in basic knowledge of what quiche is. It is big in size, loaded with crab and cheese and its flavor falls flat. This is more as a big cheese egg ""quiche alike"" american tarte. = mediocre. It is not worth of money.
(Dublin Laywer) is a very rich full flavor dish. But it is not like they use the best/freshest ingredients. Rice pilaf is ""Near East"" supermarket quality.  This dish is so dreamy creamy and  gets you sleepy like you want to retire for the rest of the week! You can get this dish almost for a half price during lunch and Sunday Brunch instead of paying double during a dinner time. 
(Lobster Benedict) on Sunday Brunch is great if you are willing to pay $14 for an upscale breakfast.
(Hot Fudge Sandae for lunch) A big dissapointment. This sandae is $7 in a nice restaurant, I expected something great or at least decent. It comes in a regular white coffee cup with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream and hot fudge syrup. That's it. $7? no way.
 
I like Nighttown. Having $5 burger with beer at Bar in the evening are blast. Outdoor patio on Lunch and Sunday Brunch on a sunny day can be a real joy. It is beautiful and spacious during summer time.",0
meXjqyhTNLFmknY39y2sMg,"The funny thing is that I go to GLBC for the beer and atmosphere and always leave most impressed by the food. The beer is good with a nice seasonal variety. The old wooden bar right when you walk in, which is from the 1860s, and the stone walled pub in the basement create such an authentic feeling like you are back in time 150 years ago. During my last visit there were a group of guys at the bar singing some song in German. Very cool. The servers are typically very cool and knowledgable. But the food is outstanding.  One of my favs is the butternut squash ravioli with Swiss chard and walnuts. Prices aren't bad for the quality you are getting.",1
meXjqyhTNLFmknY39y2sMg,"Tonight, I tried the smoked pulled pork sandwich and it was AWESOME.  As I was walking up to the brewery, I smelled two things: hops and BBQ smoke.  I was hoping it was Great Lakes that made some authentic smoky BBQ and it turns out they do!  So I looked for smoked menu items and I ordered the Bon Mi, which has authentic smoked pulled pork.  They also make a Cubano sandwich which is also delicious with smoked meat, but it was not on the menu tonight.  The waitress was perfect and the food was delicious.  The beers were great tonight too.  We tried 8 different beers and most of them were yummy.  Tonight's favorite beer was the Blackstout, which had hints of coffee and hops.

We had to wait 45 minutes to get a table, but they'll call your cell phone.  So we went next door to Bier Markt and had some of their brews before getting our table at Great Lakes.  

On the way out, I bought a nice metal bottle opener.

Recommend!",1
meXjqyhTNLFmknY39y2sMg,"Great Lakes Brewing just does everything right. Their fleet of beers excite me for my annual pilgrimage and the catacombs and service keep me coming back. Their corporate culture and commitment to sustainability should be emulated by all other businesses.

The beers are usually excellent, especially the Lake Erie Monster, Blackout Stout, and Ladder 20. The only beer of theirs I don't like is the Doppelrock, which is good considering they make about 15 different beers throughout the year. The brewpub specials are always surprising. 

The building that houses the brewpub is truly one of a kind that has an authentic feel to it. Nothing is better than enjoying an excellent beer in the catacombs. It just makes you feel special like drinking in a speak easy or a classic ratskeller in Germany. Just amazing.

The best part of GLBC is their efforts to promote sustainable business practices. From the installation of solar panels, the water reduction efforts in the pub, and my favorite, the recycling of cooking oil for the Fatty Wagon that you can take to Jacobs Field or Quicken Loans Area for a $1 round trip, they really set a great example to follow! A slogan on the coasters says ""Enjoy our beer and save the Earth"". Whenever says I've been drinking too much, I simply say ""I haven't drank too much, I simply care about the planet more than you do"". It makes my drinking habits justifiable!

I can't wait to go back to GLBC and I hope to for some time to come!",1
meXjqyhTNLFmknY39y2sMg,"Bier is outstanding - from the Christmas Ale to the IPA.  You can actually smell the brewery walking from the parking lot across the street; authentic.  

Unfortunately, service could be much better - I visited on Monday night at about 8 pm, it was crowded, so I went to the bar.  It was about ten/fifteen minutes before I was even greeted and served!  

Food is adequate; service could be better.  

Again, bier is outstanding, able to purchase in stores - brewery has a concession in the airport in Concourse A...

Will have to visit again to see if my experience was an exception and not the norm.",1
meXjqyhTNLFmknY39y2sMg,I stopped for a beer with some coworkers while in town on business. The atmosphere was great and the crowd was lively. We sat downstairs and enjoyed a couple. I had the smoked maple porter and thier standard porter. Both were very good. And I love the authentic beer cellar feel. Great place!,1
meXjqyhTNLFmknY39y2sMg,The menu here is small but fierce. I recommend going with their specials. Plenty of space with an outdoor patio and covered patio with a fire place and an expandable roof. Then a bar upstairs and downstairs. If you have not tried Great Lakes beer I recommend getting the sampler. This is what this place is known for! The Admiral Perry and Cleveland brown are my top favs! Food wise try the pizzas they are original and very tasty with a thin crust and authentic taste.,1
meXjqyhTNLFmknY39y2sMg,"I heart Great Lakes beers.

I lived in Michigan for nine years, and during that time, I was spoiled by ready access to Great Lakes brews on draft and in the bottle. While all of their beers are excellent, their Edmund Fitzgerald porter is out of this world. It ruined, absolutely ruined, Guinness for me. When I moved to MA and discovered I could no longer obtain Great Lakes without boarding a plane, I was bereft.

So of course on a trip to Cleveland I had to make the pilgrimage to the mothership. I came here for lunch and was thrilled to discover the beers weren't only amazing in my memory, but also in my mouth. The Christmas Ale was new to me but quickly became beloved, and of course I enjoyed my favorite Edmund Fitzgerald.

The food was only ok. I ordered a pork bahn mi, and it was the least Asian bahn mi I've ever seen. I don't really care if food is ""authentic"" as long as it's tasty, but the bahn mi title was actually misleading here. The sandwich was smoky barbecued pork on a soft bun with some pickled veggies, and much closer to a southern-style sandwich than a Vietnamese one. It was ok, but not what I expected based on the name and would have been improved by more sauce. A side of Brussel sprouts allowed me to pretend I was being healthy as I sipped my beer.

If I were rating only the beer, I'd award Great Lakes five stars while petitioning Yelp to let me add a sixth. Since this review is really for the location and all it includes, I've got to be honest and say it was only a four star experience. The food here doesn't seem to merit a trip, but the beer is so worthwhile that I for one would dine on Denny's while drinking it.",0
meXjqyhTNLFmknY39y2sMg,"I am reluctantly here to give this place 3 stars as much as I had hoped for better. Had this review but solely based on our beer, atmosphere, and experience, it would easily be pushing 5 stars.

We arrived after a trip to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and were hungry and thirsty for a full meal so we ordered the ramen, the vegan burger, and the nachos with chorizo. Both the vegan burger and nachos were very good and I was happy and surprised to find a vegan option on the menu at this kind of place that was actually super flavorful however, this review starts going down drastically because of the ramen. 

UGH, the ""ramen"". Had I been a more proactive Yelper before visiting I would have known that the ramen is a disgrace to Japanese cuisine. Can we get a PSA that this ramen is closer to the 15 cent package from Walmart than a brothy, flavorful ramen?? We asked our server how it was and she refrained from mentioning that it was less than authentic and not would your average foodie would consider ""ramen"". Expectations did not meet reality. Anyways, we received ramen, ON A PLATE, like not in a bowl.......with barely any broth. We were honestly so confused. The overall flavor was okay but lacked the general depth of flavor of traditional ramen. My boyfriend has never sent anything back in the history of us dining together but we ended up sending it back and getting it removed from our bill. Our server was less than thrilled about accommodating this request but she inevitably did remove it. We explained to her the situation and that our expectations did not match what we received. It looks like other Yelpers have had similar reactions to this dish. If I was to make any recommendations to Great Lakes, I would remove the item or offer a heads up under the description that this item isn't what you may necessarily expect. 

*Jumps off soapbox* Overall, our experience was really great and we loved the vibe inside and the pub downstairs. We came in the first place because we are extremely big fans of Great Lakes brews! I would definitely give this place another shot if we are in the area again.",0
MHxce6ztMkbYHR8z3Z1q3g,"Went to Jack's on the recommendation of a friend who grew up in Cleveland Heights, and the homegirl was right--the food was good and so satisfying. Had a trio of sliders with corned beef, pastrami, and chopped liver. The serving was so big, I took it home for dinner shared with dear husband ( I noticed everyone at the checkout ahead of me had a take-home box, too.) The meats were lean, tender, sliced authentically thin, and the pastrami had just the right amount of spice. Maybe the best pastrami this side of Katz's in NYC. The chicken liver could have used more diced onion and chicken fat. And the borscht is rich with cabbage, but as sweet as cotton candy. Their grill is not just an afterthought, as son had a well-cooked burger.
My only complaint was the service. Once we were seated, the waitress was right there, took our order, and the kitchen was reasonably fast. But when we arrived, there was a line out the door to be seated. We waited for 40 minutes behind 3 parties of 6 (hey, they gotta eat, too), but when we got to the dining room, there were at least 10 empty 2-top to 4-top tables and booths. They could have easily seated the small parties, instead of making us wait in line behind the large parties. What's up with that? I thought maybe they were short staffed on wait help, but there were bussers and waitresses standing around, waiting for tables to fill up.Not the way to turn your tables! I'll go back to Jack's, but maybe not on a family-brunch Saturday.",0
MHxce6ztMkbYHR8z3Z1q3g,We frequent this place often. We have tried just about everything. IT IS ALL EXCELLENT and authentic deli food. I love the bright green fresh pickles but the vinegar brined are also good. The sandwiches are piled high with lean meat. The egg and tuna salad are tasty. Breakfast is a delight. Homemade challah French toast?  Yes please. Nova lox and bagels?  Yum. This place is the real deal. Eat here.,1
MHxce6ztMkbYHR8z3Z1q3g,"Jacks is awesome, so authentic. It's like sitting in the Seinfeld coffee shop. Last time I was there funny Yiddish translations on all the TV were streaming. 

Best corned beef on the east side. Best bread anywhere!!  The crust or the soft bread jeez Louise!  Best potato salad too. 

Love this place along with slymans, joes & Tal's u got ur corned beef fix covered. I took a pic of the sandwich but it's gone I didn't post in time!!

100 stars go there for lunch!!!",1
MHxce6ztMkbYHR8z3Z1q3g,"Wow, what a find! Our friend brought us here tonight for a quick, casual and inexpensive dinner. It was all of that and more. This place is a throw back in time. It's been run by the same family for 30+years. When you walk in you cn tell it's authentic just by looking at the patrons. It's divided into two sections a very large dining room and a delicatessen counter in the back. The worst thing that hit the table after we sat down was a plate of real garlic kosher dill pickle spears.

The menu is very straightforward. Nothing complicated, nothing fancy and fully appropriate for the place. They have daily specials and today's special for Tuesday's was corned beef. So on a chalkboard they had about five different corned beef items that were on special 
sale. But for me there was no hesitation on my part. I wanted pastrami so I had it on rye bread and a side of potato salad it comes with it. I also ordered onion rings. My wife was not very hungry so she had a cup of Cabbage  Borscht and one single cheese blintz. Our friend had the same thing I had - pastrami on rye with potato salad.

The pastrami was great. Enough fat for plenty of flavor but not so much that it was overloaded and greasy. The rye bread was fresh had a great flavor. I put deli mustard on mine. My wife really enjoyed her cabbage borscht and the blends. The portions were very large so she was stuffed even though she had designed it to be a light dinner.

I can't say enough about this place. I just wish there was one like this within 50 miles of our home. Maybe I can sweet-talk them into opening hey West Coast version of this place!

MjAuGkgPjNLyMrN74_0YbA,My wife and I eat here every time we are in Cleveland. love the piano bar. The steaks are fantastic  and the Italian dishes are authentic. We love our daughter Danielle for bringing us here,1
MjLRxNBuFR9DvA2XzQAXIA,"The corned beef here is all I ever order. I had to try it for lunch after walking by the place and smelling corned beef every morning on the way to work. East 17th is a great place to check out some of the cool homeless of the city. They are always partying it up, drinking Wild Irish Rose from the corner store Grossmans. The corned beef is good. If you wish to avoid the fatty cuts off the brisket, you can opt for extra lean meat for an extra 50 cents. The sandwiches are expensive ($8 or $9) but it is a five inch thick mass of corned beef. It is a real authentic Cleveland deli. Just bare bones inside with a nice bar style row to watch the grill cooks get busy. My friends ordered the chicken philly and something else and said it was good.",1
MKCbZC6KR4oxA4LOQAVdhw,This place is really good Greek food! I wasn't sure what to expect because it's a little pricey compared to other fast casual. However make no mistake it's authentic and made to order. The only thing I wouldn't recommend are the lamb sliders - Flavor is good but portion size is not worth the price point.,1
MmHg20VupqMSQXL0jLNFmg,"Fantastic food, good service, and authentic Lebanese Dishes. This is by far my favorite Lebanese restaurant in the area. If you go you have to try the combination platter. It comes with a skewer of chicken, lamb, and kefta (ground lamb/beef and spices). All served on a bed of rice with a side of garlic mayo which is delightful.

I've eaten at the Cedarland many times and have never been disappointed. All the appetizers are fantastic especially the hummus. The fatoosh salad and the kibbee are also great starters.

You should give this place a try if you like Lebanese or Arab food. Much better than Aladdin's. The food is much more authentic and the staff is much friendlier.",1
MmHg20VupqMSQXL0jLNFmg,"Had the chicken shwarma today which was not even close to authentic. It seemed to have been fried it oil and there was not enough tahini and no pickled turnip or anything in the sandwich. Drippin oil an pretty gross in my opinion. Service was horrible, never got refills on drinks. They didn't even bother to tell us they don't bring your check to the table oh also they don't accept credit cards under $10 and said that I was making them lose money.",0
MPioAPoOmQPts89sBSiFog,"Authentic Italian pizza that is a burst of sensational flavors in your mouth--and the decor and ambiance of the restaurant provide a most enjoyable and relaxing space in which to eat your happy pie.  

We went on a Thursday night and ordered a Margherita pie with pepperoni, sausage, and spicy salami.

THE PIZZA
         The crust.  The base starts with the magical hands of the pizza chefs and with their hilarious dynamics and magnetic personalities.  As they knead and stretch the dough and throw it in the air to give the pie it's shape and consistently thin crust their energy, humor, enthusiasm, creativity, and kindness gets infused into the crust giving it its authentic Italian flavor.  The crust is thin, light, and slightly crispy on the edges but wet/flimsy in the middle--you'll have to use a fork and knife if you don't fold the center back and then fold the pie in half. The edges are dry and slightly charred that gives it a nice flavor and texture. 
         The red sauce.  Rich and sweet.
         The mozzarella.  Creamy. Delicate flavor. 
         The toppings.  Like an Italian flag. Spicy. Premier flavors. 
          Balance.  A good balance of crust, sauce, and cheese.  You don't see the sauce through the cheese but it's not over powering.

THE SERVICE
        The wait staff were casual, easy going, genuine, kind, prompt, helpful, and a delight to engage.  I follow Il Rione on Instagram and the pizza chefs are a two enjoyable guys.  I just had to get a selfie with them 

THE SPACE
         I really appreciated the adequate space between the tables.  I didn't feel like I was eating with my neighbors or have to worry that I'm being overheard by the couple next to me.  The rustic, classy, casual decor and music enable me to feel relaxed and complimented the pizza.  Going to Il Rione feels like going to a neighborhood pizza joint.

This place gets my ""best in Cleveland vote.""",1
MPioAPoOmQPts89sBSiFog,"When I heard Il Rione was going to be making Jersey-style pizza, I started Garden State Fan-Girling long before they opened. These guys got it all right: the decor, the cozy neighborhood atmosphere, the simple - but simply perfect - salads and the bar that is the hub of the hub-bub that gives Il Rione the 'everybody wants to be here vibe'. Their crust is something you can't describe - but it is the exact taste and texture of the shops where I formed my opinion of what makes a perfect pie. I love recommending this place, because everyone should enjoy authentic Jersey pizza. And because the Brians work hard to make Il Rione the best neighborhood pizza place we all want to come back to again and again. It's a simple menu, but, if you don't know what to order - ask - they love sharing their passion with their customers.",1

This place never disappoints and I would recommend it for anyone who is craving pizza!",1
MPioAPoOmQPts89sBSiFog,"I can't believe we have pizza this good in Cleveland

This is an authentic pie - freshly made and not some midwest pizza. It's a cross between New York and New Jersey style with a really good crust and sauce. 

The Margherita and Green Pie with sage and pesto are phenomenal. 

We are lucky to have them in town !!",1
MPioAPoOmQPts89sBSiFog,Now this is the best most authentic New York style pizza in Cleveland. Everyone else's pie is over rated and or ignorantly favored.  This is a great date spot to impress your date on your fine tuned taste as you watch her eat more than she thought she would bc the pie is so damn good.  Everything is fresh including the sausage and pepperoni definitely a hidden gem and off the radar.  If you're feeling clever try the clam pie.,1
MSc5pybthcvHa0g_lg5wuQ,Great place - large variety of pies that are tastefully made. I had a couple of different pizzas that were tasty and not too heavy. By no means authentic pizza but still worth a try. Very nice staff and good place for the whole family. Will be going there again very soon.,1
MSc5pybthcvHa0g_lg5wuQ,"Dewey's is one of my favorite pizza places.  It's definitely one of the best in Cleveland.

I have never eaten anything at Dewey's that I didn't like (salad, pizza, calzones, and dessert).  The staff is extremely attentive, but never annoying.  I feel like this is also the least greasy pizza I've ever had, which I really like.  The crust is excellent and it never gets gross or soggy from grease.  Most importantly, it reheats really well at home!

The waiting area gets cramped because it's a pretty popular place on the weekend, but there are big windows allowing you to watch the kitchen at work, making the wait more bearable.

I consider Dewey's to be more of a gourmet pizza restaurant though; if you want an authentic and/or Italian experience you should look elsewhere.  This also isn't the most inexpensive pizza around, not that the prices are unreasonable.  The cost does prevent me from eating here more often, but I still highly recommend Dewey's.",1
MVIthKWqwkQz0dai7LkVzQ,"Vegans and vegetarians--there are TONS of options here (kind of overwhelming, tbh). Tommy's is in an awesome location and the atmosphere is cute. It's connected to a cool bookstore, too. If you're a burgers and fries/massive salads/milkshake kind of person, this place is for you. I've been here quite a few times and while there are many things I can eat, I haven't found anything that was particularly ""amazing."" The prices could be knocked down by a buck or so, too ($7.75 for a small portion of french onion soup? $7+ for a tofutti ""milkshake""?) seem a little steep for Cleveland area pricing. Other menu items, like the salads or fries are massively portioned, so it really depends on what you get.

Note: non-vegan shakes are much more reasonably priced. I had them many a time before I converted to veganism and I definitely enjoyed them!

There are a lot of dishes that offer variations on falafel, hummus, and baba ghanouj. These tend to be decently good but not amazing/authentic tasting. Why not go to Aladdin's or something of the link for this sort of fare?

That all said, after trying a lot of menu items, the ""tofu salad"" is actually really good.",1
mXaqyzYTqiTc-LrTFAm0Yw,Just amazing. Found it on Yelp and it won't disappoint. Quaint little place with authentic cuisine and food. The staff was very friendly and spoke to us. Everything on the menu looks good. We were told the food was never frozen and made from scratch. Worth a visit.,1
mXaqyzYTqiTc-LrTFAm0Yw,"I LOVE this place!! As a native Floridian from the home of the Cuban sandwich (Tampa) I had been looking high and low for a real, authentic Cuban. When I walked in I immediately felt like I was home. The decor, the music, everything screams Miami and Cuba...Love.

The owner and the other lady working with her were wonderful. Delightful to talk to and very customer service oriented. 

Of course I had the Cuban and the owner forewarned me that it might be different than I was used to. Thing is, when I travel, in most places I don't expect to find REAL Cuban bread which if you don't know, makes a Cuban sandwich. 

The sandwich was amazing, exactly what I had hoped for. Perfectly marinated pork, just the right amount of topping and cheese and perfectly pressed. She also brought out a chipotle style dip that she made to go with the sandwich that gives it a little extra something. I dipped into it a few different times and it was awesome but for the most part I stuck with the original because that's what makes me feel at home. 

One more thing....the owner is by trade a graphic designer and has lots of cool art and jewelry for sale as well. 

MUST TRY spot in Cleveland!",1
mXaqyzYTqiTc-LrTFAm0Yw,"So, i thought i had reviewed this local Cleveland gem... But It apparently it was when they were at their old location. The new location is even better, it's adorable and colorful, and features tropical like decor and the owner's very own artwork. I absolutely adore this place. The food is authentic and extremely fresh...not greasy at all!  They have something for everyone. I highly recommend the Huevos with tortillas with pico and refried beans. The tostones (fried plantains) are to die for...and you can get them smothered in cheese! I also love the vegetarian rice bowl with sweet plantains and avocado...they dont always have it but when they do it's perfect! They also have a variety of empanadas, including a yummy breakfast one. My boyfriend who is Cuban-American loves their Cuban Sandwich...and that is saying alot about the authenticity. Oh, and they love dogs! So in the summer bring your pooch and sit outside! My only recommendation is to add more vegetarian dishes, but otherwise you can't miss this local gem!!",1
mXaqyzYTqiTc-LrTFAm0Yw,"This was on my Staycation Foodie List since I've read so many great things about this place. After almost passing it I walked in & INSTANTLY felt like I had traveled far away & walked into someone's house. The atmosphere was just that good, From the artwork on the walls to all the authentic items in the 'living room' area & the music being played. The server was very polite kind & helpful. The food was AWESOME. I ordered the Iced Mayan Mocha which was chocolatey & sweet with a flavorful whipped cream topping.  Cubano Sandwich with a spicy sauce the owner recommended. The bread was crunchy soft with perfectly cooked flavorful pork & thin ham. Last thing u ordered was the Key West Breakfast Empanada. This was my 2st time eating a fresh empanada & the crust was great but the egg on the inside was something special in its scrambled seasoned texture. My only regrets were that I forgot to drink that last few sips of mocha in which the whipped cream had melted into the Iced chocolate goodness. Also forgot the sauce for my leftover Cubano sandwich. LOVED this place ^ will be returning often.",1
mXaqyzYTqiTc-LrTFAm0Yw,I just had lunch here with a few of my friends. The food was super fresh and authentic. The service was top notch and friendly. Make sure you save room for the churros- you won't be sorry.,1
mXaqyzYTqiTc-LrTFAm0Yw,So yummy! My co-workers and I love trying new places. And this spot is amazing! So authentic. We definitely will be trying this place again! Can't wait!,1
mXaqyzYTqiTc-LrTFAm0Yw,"1st time here and we got the Cuban colada. Small but very good worth it! I ordered the turmeric latte excellent! The food here is definitely authentic. Thank you! I will tell everyone and will be back for more coffee, and food.",1
mXaqyzYTqiTc-LrTFAm0Yw,"Outstanding. Friendly people. Fabulous authentic  foods. The best Cuban sandwich I've ever had, and I had many. 

I will return, and I will bring friends and family, as they too deserve to experience this little gem of a restaurant",1
mXaqyzYTqiTc-LrTFAm0Yw,"Small place with big flavor! We stumbled across this Cuban gem and will definitely be back. We had chicken and beef empanadas, which were to die for. And when another dish we wanted was sold out, we were provided a generous sample of their Spanish paella special for free. It was fabulous! We topped it all of with a couple of tasty Mayan mochas.

The only thing better than their food has to be the atmosphere. A family owned and operated business, we were greeted warmly and fussed over when they learned it was our first time. The mother-daughter duo was just as friendly and helpful to a group of obvious regulars, such a great community feel. We felt like we were among friends. The authentic Cuban decor completes the scene, with art from the owner throughout.

Definitely give this place a chance to impress you! We look forward to coming back.",1
mXaqyzYTqiTc-LrTFAm0Yw,"I learned about this place from a fellow foodie. This place is tucked in the middle among a few lack luster businesses so it is very easy to drive by and not even know it exists. But what is lacks from its outside looks is far shadowed by the quality of the food and service, like a million times over. God bless Mariela, just a Cuban angel from heaven who opened this place and personally painted/decorated the place. She is so humble, genuine and invested in her craft. She is an artist as well, so the front of the restaurant showcases her work. I will tell you that half of my love of this place comes just from my experience with her. She did not seat us nor serve us, she simply came out to assess our satisfaction and despite the number of people in the cafe, spoke with us for at least 20 minutes.

But I came for the food, which was excellent as well. The place was so authentic, I really felt like I was in Cuba with respect to the decor and the heat (I will say poor AC or ventilation....even with the door wide open, still quite warm and sweaty inside when I ate there this summer). So i started with a cuban colada for $2.25, which is a cuban espresso, but felt more like liquid cocaine in a 4 oz cup. Like most Spanish coffees it is already sweetened, it was not burnt at all. In fact the flavor was smooth like silk and the energy hit me like an upper punch. I got the Cuban sandwich for my entree for $8.99 (pork roast, sweet ham, swiss cheese, pickles, mayo and mustard). What a deal, I could easily see this priced as like $12 at a normal place. I was pleasantly full at the end.

Please check the website for hours as the closing time seems to vary between 2:30 and 8pm. However they faithfully open at 11:30 am daily.

Enjoy and tell Mariela hi for me!",1
mXaqyzYTqiTc-LrTFAm0Yw,"We came for lunch here today with friends. The coffees were excellent. The food was excellent. We love Cuban food, and this place seems to be authentic. The service was very friendly as well.  Looking forward to returning.",1
n_UlhRNcv9dm04NbUNBrFQ,This place has nice variety for burritos. I like that they take multiple ethnic foods and turn it into an awesome tasting burrito. Great stop for food and it's somewhat healthy- however for someone who likes more authentic flavor the tikka burrito was on the mild taste for flavor and salt.,1
n0NH0FW8NU3zfeJY3QluMQ,"Downtown Irish pub across the street from the Cavaliers stadium. Had the usual Irish dishes plus American deli sandwich staples, salads and a few hamburgers. Chose the Colcannon soup--something I hadn't had before so no idea if Flannery's is authentic. Potato-based with chopped kale, cabbage and leek cooked in, it was tasty though the potato abundance made it as thick as oatmeal. 
My shepherd's pie was more like a hamburger gravy with a thin layer of mashed potatoes atop. 
Chose Guinness chocolate cake for dessert. The small brick of cake had a heavy cocoa flavoring and rather dry taste, with a paste of chocolate icing that didn't quite mate with the cake. 
The meal was just lackluster. 
Turned up here as the Cavs were warming up and commented on missing the Tuesday rush. ""Yeah, but we weren't very busy,"" the hostess replied.",0
n0NH0FW8NU3zfeJY3QluMQ,"Good: Love the authentic Irish pub feel. The taps and pouring of a Guinness stout is perfect. Wood bar is respectful. Great overall atmosphere. Great bartenders. 

Bad: I'm shocked - people can't even have a conversation with the annoying banging noise of ske-ball right off the bar. Seriously?  Is this an Irish bar or an arcade?  Might  as well peddle Cotton candy and stuffed giraffes. Disappointing. Time to find remember your Irish roots guys. 

Also - where is the music?",1
n0NH0FW8NU3zfeJY3QluMQ,"An excellent Irish pub without a lot of frills, but with a whole lot of heart. The staff are attentive, the beer is relatively cheap, and the food is authentic. There is a nice room in back to play pool, which I appreciate. What happened to good old pool halls being ubiquitous in Cleveland? Truthfully, Flanney's is a throwback in many ways beyond the pool table. Take out a TV or two and this could be a Dublin pub circa 1925. A quality downtown bar for those look for something a little less high brow than the major contenders at the heart of E. 4th.",1
n0NH0FW8NU3zfeJY3QluMQ,My husband and i stopped in cleveland for a night and looked for a place open late and flannerys was still lively and kitchen was even open! They had authentic irish dishes and drinks it was really cool. Id reccomend to anyone into this style of food and spirits.,1
n0NH0FW8NU3zfeJY3QluMQ,"I love British and Irish pubs.  I have spent time in both countries, mainly England for several years, and so I have a base to compare things to.  So is this what I, or most folks would think of as an authentic 'pub'?  No.  But then again, there are actually very few of those in the UK or Ireland these days.  They have all started to go a little more urban and upscale as it were.   There are still a few of the classic ones around, don't get me wrong, but the majority are starting to look and feel like Flannery's.  So that is the POV.

I have been here twice.  Either before or after some thing we were doing downtown, House of Blues....  We have never had to wait in a line, although the place stays pretty busy and has a lot of folks dining ot drinking. 

The place is open and comfy, great long bar to sit at or tables and booths. If you are a sports fan, lots of TV's at all the right angles.  They are happy to tune in to something if you cant see what you want.

They have a great beer selection although I would like to see more items from the UK and Ireland.  But lots of the typical local and micro brew.  They have a full bar, but I believe no frozen drinks.  I might recommend they invest in a blender.  It is only two pours and two buttons to a frozen Margarita.

So the food is not bad.  I would not make this your 'special' evening dinner spot, but for a bar, it is pretty good.  They do some things that are traditional, then they try to do some things 'Irish'.  The Irish is not 100% authentic, but if you have not had authentic, how would you know.  :-)

If you consider this a place to hang out, spend times with friends before or after some other activity, I think you will be happy.  It is just a really good casual spot.",1
n0NH0FW8NU3zfeJY3QluMQ,"I find it rare in American to find a truly authentic Irish restaurant. A truly authentic Irish restaurant must have an Irish atmosphere, traditional Irish menu and pour a perfect pint of Guinness plus have other Irish beers. This had all of this but the menu was slightly limited hence the four stars and not five. I highly recommend this pub to anyone looking for the above mentioned. Cheers!",1
n0NH0FW8NU3zfeJY3QluMQ,"This is another ""American Irish"" bar. This does not resemble a traditional Irish pub, and the food isn't authentic either, for example: Shepherd's Pie is made with ground lamb not beef. And since when has Chicken Marsala been a traditional Irish dish? I know I'm being picky but still... I opted for the fish and chips, and was disappointed with the quality of the fish and the over-cooked FRIES, not chips. The reuben was ""just ok."" The service was good, and the place had a nice atmosphere. Extensive beer list too.",0
n0NH0FW8NU3zfeJY3QluMQ,"I hadn't been here in years, but the remodel looks great. It is was more open, and I know Irish pubs are supposed to be authentic and cozy and dark; it still had some of that feel but just much more accessible and appropriate for downtown. They had great beer selection, a nice combo of Irish selections and american craft beers. Their new menu which wasn't super expensive but a decent variety and options. We started with the poutine which was delicious. Their gravy is phenomenal! I wish they actually had a bigger option to share with a whole table, the size a bit more 2 people friendly. For dinner I ordered a second appetizer, the Guinness mushrooms, I expected it to be a handful of small mushroom caps battered, but it was 4 HUGE mushroom caps stuffed with a cream cheese veggie dip w/ broccoli and then battered with spicy dipping sauce on the side. Very yummy but a bit too much or too thick of batter/breading for my personal preference. My boyfriend ordered the chicken sandwich as did his brother, it looked really good, both devoured them. Their dad ordered the arugula salad AND the salmon entree. Both looked amazing. The salmon was cooked perfectly and served with mashed potatoes and seasonal veggies. It looked healthy and delicious. Another table near us ordered mac and cheese and next time, I NEED it. It looked so decadent.",1
N5nB7bt89WYvobTGIP1vPA,"Authentic Ethiopian food with, sadly, authentic Ethiopian service.  

The good news; the food here is great.  You can eat at a small hut, and have the bread spread over the table like pizza dough, and eat little bits of spiced vegetables and meats by tearing off the bread and then scooping it up with your hands.  It's phenomenally tasty, even though you should be warned that the bread WILL expand in your stomach.  

When you're done, you can have genuine Ethiopian coffee, which is like thick Turkish coffee but a little more cinnamony.

The only problem?  Don't come here unless you have some SERIOUS time to kill.  We spent two hours, and the coffee took - no joke - another hour to get.  It was delicious, but every time we've thought about going back, we asked, ""Do we have the time?""  And we've heard from friends that the situation hasn't improved.",1
N5nB7bt89WYvobTGIP1vPA,"Wow!  Talk about a unique place.  The ambiance is like nothing else in the city that I've experienced.  If you want authentic, then this place is for you.  The staff are extremely nice and the food was great.",1
N5nB7bt89WYvobTGIP1vPA,"Despite the neighborhood which leaves much to be desired, this restuarant is authentic and lovely.

I am tall, my date, also tall. We sat at the traditional basket tables underneath the thatch hut-like roof. We looked like Will Ferrel in Elf, and felt a bit silly, but it would not have been the same without the table designed for the food.

I seriously can not tell you what we ordered, we got an appetizer sampler and a meal sampler. 

All of the bread is delicious and unlike anything I had ever had. I LOVE bread and was delighted to try a different kind. I may even purchase the flour used to make it. 

It was definately not a first-date kind of place. You should know the person you are eating with pretty well considering the lack of utensils. 

I really like the warm towel they provided to cleanse your hands before the meal.",1
N5nB7bt89WYvobTGIP1vPA,"YES. Hidden gem of a place nearly 30 years in business. If you're looking for a chill spot with twinkle lights under an indoor bamboo tent, dope Ethiopian art, and a like-minded, diverse crowd, this place sets the mood. As I'm newly gluten intolerant and a deep lover of American food, I've now made a point to eat more ethnic flavors. Empress Taytu made all of my GF dreams come true. They have GF bread that is perfectly sour along with the Combo Meal (I had veggie/meat combo). And their lentil soup is to die for. It's very clear that every dish is a family recipe, handed down from years ago -- simple but bursting with flavor. 

Other highlights: friendly service, fun seating, authentic coffee & Ethiopian beer!",1
N5nB7bt89WYvobTGIP1vPA,"Seriously the best service and most authentic food I've tasted in Cleveland. My good friend and I went there after he raved about how good it was. Relaxing atmosphere, great good, and fun music. It's a great getaway for date night and an opportunity for those who want to be more adventurous and eat with there hands.",1
N5nB7bt89WYvobTGIP1vPA,"Are you looking for a new exotic place to eat with healthy food options? Look no further. The empress Taytu is very authentic, delicious and an overall experience that you will want to have again. Don't forget to have the tea ceremony experience under the indoor hut ceremonial area. Injera bread was never more tasty. Get in there, eat with your hands, have a true Ethiopian experience. Awesome place to eat, don't think twice about coming here.",1
N5nB7bt89WYvobTGIP1vPA,"Very nice and authentic place. Would recommend getting a traditional table setting, than just a table and chair. Very authentic decor. 
As for food, very eclectic taste. Would definitely recommend the mushrooms and chicken dorawat. If someone's in a brace mood, would definitely recommend the raw beef. 
Try the traditional ""their own specific"" drink too.",1
N5nB7bt89WYvobTGIP1vPA,"Moving from NYC to Cleveland has caused for search for a great Ethiopian place.  The empress feels fairly authentic especially when you see the cooks in the kitchen doing their magic and again in landlocked Cleveland ingredients need to be imported or substituted.  Like Mexican food there is nothing like sitting down in Mexico to eat a meal and I believe that would be the same of Ethiopian food.    I give them high marks because I see they care and are doing their best here.
  The staff are  friendly and when we bring our now 8 month old, he is greeted with warm smiles and waves.",1
N5nB7bt89WYvobTGIP1vPA,"Try it for the sense of adventure and discovery. Try it for the genuine warmth and kindness of the people. Try it for the delicious food that you eat with your hands. Just try it.

The dÁE©cor is cozy, island-y, authentic-feeling, and pleasantly dated. My table of four split four vegetarian entrees and it was more than enough. Airy pancakes are used to scoop and eat the food. The pancake texture is really odd -- but in a good way; you'll see what I mean when you get your own paws on them. Each entree was $9-10.

The people working here couldn't have been any more warm and friendly.

I want to go back and share it with more friends. Soon!",1
N5nB7bt89WYvobTGIP1vPA,"My first, and so far best, dining experience at an Ethiopian restaurant. This is the place where I first discovered my love for injera (Ethiopian bread), beef tibs (cubes of beef marinated in an Ethiopian blend of spices), and tej (Ehtiopian honey wine). The food was truly amazing. The above mentioned items are must tries. 

If you can't consume alcohol and cannot compliment your meal with the tej wine, the mango juice should suffice as a good alternative. 

The vegetable combination is also delicious. The common vegetables, prepared with specialty spices in a uniquely Ethiopian fashion, provide a good balance to the meal when eaten with the meat dishes. 

Also, if time and budget permit, try the authentic Ethiopian coffee ""ceremony."" It is a bit pricey but it is one of those things you must try at least once. You sit on little footstools while the server performs the ritual coffee roasting ceremony basking those partaking with the wonderful scent of fresh Ethiopian coffee. The server then adds a tiny bit of butter into the coffee (instead of milk or cream), which is apparently how it is served in their country. 

If and when you do come, try to sit under the hut in the corner of the room on the little stools and eat from the large communal plate on top of the traditional basket table stand - this will make the experience more enjoyable.
 
This restaurant is the most authentic Ethiopian establishment I have eaten at thus far. The ambiance is more authentic than any of the Ethiopian/East African restaurants in my hometown of San Diego, despite the much larger population of immigrants from the Eastern (Horn of) Africa region. 

In fact, I enjoyed Ethiopian cuisine so much that one of the first things I did after I moved back to San Diego after college, was look for Ethiopian restaurants and try the ones I found. My friends and I enjoyed Empress Taytu so much that we made the 1+ hour drive from Wooster, just to come to here, numerous times after discovering this restaurant. 

Keep in mind, this restaurant is not located in the best area of Cleveland. Nonetheless, this place as a must try even though the outside of the restaurant and surrounding neighborhood is less than aesthetically pleasing, to say the least.",1
N5nB7bt89WYvobTGIP1vPA,I really like the experience at this restaurant.It's very authentic - the food takes quite a bit of time to make which could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on the person. I was pretty relaxed at the time so I was not in a hurry.,1
N5nB7bt89WYvobTGIP1vPA,"My brother and I planned going out to dinner for the last month. We finally got together and he recommended coming here. He said it is his favorite place to eat in Cleveland. He is a vegan and they have plenty of options for him. We arrived shortly after 5, right when they opened. The asked if we would like to sit in the authentic seat, which is low seats with a table that has a bowl in the center covered with cloth. The interior is pretty cool. There are a few huts that you can sit under. The bar table is actually a hut also. The lighting was dim and inviting. The server was beautiful and the service was excellent. They bring steaming, hot towels to wipe your hands with before you eat. The appetizers were delicious. They bring out a bunch of these pancake type things that you use to grab up the food with. They look like sea sponges smushed into flat cakes. The bean dip side was good. So were the greens. My brother got a bean dish entree and the server recommended I try the beef cubes. It was great food. The experience was fun. I am going to start coming here on a regular basis.",1
N5nB7bt89WYvobTGIP1vPA,"YES 100% YES to this amazing restaurant. This is not just dinner, this an entire experience. My family opted for the traditional table setting which I highly recommend for the experience. The food was delicious and fun to eat. I myself had the Chicken Tibs which were juicy and deliciously spiced. I also tried a bit of my mother's Bozena shiro which was delicious. After dining, we partook in the coffee ceremony and it was an unforgettable event. The coffee was so aromatic and tasted absolutely delicious. The coffee ceremony was an amazing end to our delicious dinner and I definitely recommend trying it if you can!


I must admit that I have never had Ethiopian food before dining here, so I am unable to speak to the authenticity of the food. I can speak to the deliciousness of it though. It was a unique experience eating with my hands and creating what basically amounted to little burritos with their injera (flatbread-type food) and my chicken. It was fun to create my own food.


The waitress was amazingly nice and definitely willing to recommend food to those who are not familiar with Ethiopian food. I often times find myself recommending Empress Taytu to friends who want a nice, interesting night out. If you haven't tried it yet, you should!",1
N5nB7bt89WYvobTGIP1vPA,"If you're looking for Ethiopian food north of Columbus, this is the only place in Greater Cleveland where you can find it.  That being said, everything here - from the wall decorations to the food - has a degree of uniqueness that cannot be easily duplicated from those not intimately familiar with it!  Having been to Ethiopia (2007) I can attest to the authenticity of this establishment and the cuisine that it serves.  

Being a vegetarian, I usually order the Bayanetu (vegetable platter) which is served on a round platter with enjera (Ethiopian flatbread), a bread made from teff flour that acts as both a utensil and a food item. It already goes without saying that the coffee is a must have, if you can appreciate the best tasting coffee in the world.  Now, the only reason that I omitted a star is due to the high prices of menu items. If this restaurant were in the D.C area, which is home to the largest Ethiopian community outside Ethiopia, it would have a difficult time staying in business as the prices would be considered too high compared to the dozens of other Ethiopian establishments in the National Capital region.  Here in Cleveland however, it is a lone fixture on an otherwise barren landscape that caters to a predominately non-Ethiopian customer base. Still, the quality of the food is excellent and the portions are generous, which is why I would recommend it to anybody!",1
N5nB7bt89WYvobTGIP1vPA,"When I want Ethiopian food with a beautiful ambiance, Empress Taytu is where I come! Their private parking lot is super convenient, and offers plenty of space. Stepping inside, you are quickly greeted by a friendly hostess, and given the option for a typical table, or one of the traditional Ethiopian tables which is lower and gives a more authentic dining experience. The food comes out relatively quickly after ordering, and the portions are plentiful! I love the cabbage, the kale, and beef tibs! The bread provided is spongy, soft, and has a mild flavor. It goes so well with everything, and is intended to be used as your eating utensil. Ethiopian cuisine is such a flavorful treat and a must try! You won't be disappointed!",1
N5nB7bt89WYvobTGIP1vPA,"Great authentic food, spectacular service and a welcoming staff. My first time eating Ethiopian food and I was stunned! The meat and veggie combo was superb! It was so flavorful and delicious. The ingredients they use are fantastic! The coffee ceremony was a once in a lifetime experience. Definitely one of the best restaurants in greater Cleveland.",1
N5nB7bt89WYvobTGIP1vPA,"From my personal experience,  people either like Ethiopian cuisine or don't care for it.   The aromatics and spice combinations used along with the eating with your hand aspect could be somewhat intimidating to some.   However,  the chances of anyone enjoying this cuisine can be ruined by poor service and long wait times.  I used to frequent Empress Taytu some years ago and recently went back after a lengthy period of break.  I'm very sad to have to agree with some of the recent reviews on the very poor quality service here. 

I can clearly understand how for a first timer, the poor service can completely make the experience unworthy of time and price at Empress Taytu.  This can happen to even repeat customers like myself.  The taste of food hasn't change here from when I remember.   However the service quality has significantly degraded here.  Our drinks came out almost 30 min after the order, in stages and sometimes wrong. Our food came out almost an hour and forty five minutes after our order.  We were one of 3 other parties in the restaurant - where one party had 2 people and the other only 4.  The restaurant was only probably 15% capacity during the whole time.

Being the only viable option of Ethiopian cuisine in Cleveland,  Empress Taytu could  resurrect its past glory of excellent food paired with excellent service.  They can also consider updating their interior decor while still maintaining an authentic cultural flare to the space.  Some of the dated aspects could be replaced with some of the modern cultural items.   The service quality most definitely needs to be re-planned.  The kitchen needs to be better staffed with more quicker turnaround without sacrificing quality - they did it before, I'm sure they can do it again.   The attentiveness of wait staff needs to be significantly improved and if some menu items or drink items need to be reduced to increase the efficiencies in other areas then such could be considered.

At present the price to quality ratio is far too imbalanced for Empress Taytu to be considered a 'must-go' or even 'good-to-go' recommendation in my personal opinion.",0
N5nB7bt89WYvobTGIP1vPA,"Now this is some REAL Ethiopian food! 

Empress Taytu is a gem. It's authentic, and family run. The minute you enter, you forget about the fact that you are in one of the shittiest neighborhoods in Cleveland! You can hear the women speaking ... well, Ethiopian, I guess! When you walk in the entire staff is dressed in traditional Ethiopian clothing, and they welcome you warmly. They even have a grass-roofed hut to sit under for dinner, which makes you feel you are enjoying your meal outdoors. You sit on low African seats around a woven basket table, and the waitress brings you hot cloths to wash your hands with right away. 

When your food comes, it is laid out on a large round serving tray which is lined with Injera bread. The food is served in neat little piles on top of that. Each person gets their own basket of fresh injera to tear away, and ""pinch"" the different meat and veggie dishes with. Of course, you eat with your hands. 

Empress Taytu has a few beer, wine, and mixed drink selections. They also have a coffee ceremony to end the meal with. 

Now that I live in San Diego, I sure do miss Empress Taytu! It was a first-rate experience at a super reasonable price!",1
N5nB7bt89WYvobTGIP1vPA,"Wonderful experience!!! The food was authentic and delicious, our server was from Ethiopia and was very nice and friendly, the environment was authentic, and the coffee service was great! I highly recommend this restaurant. It takes a little time, as many good things do, and it is worth it. I also suggest you try the traditional tables.",1
N5nB7bt89WYvobTGIP1vPA,"I don't like to hand out 5 stars to anyone. I generally believe that there is always room for improvement. I was expecting the same old Americanized Ethiopian food, with locally sourced semi authentic ingredients. To my astonishment, from the very first bite I knew I was eating something special. The Restaurant's patron makes a journey once a year to her home country to have her village help prepare her berbere spice mix. It is not just the amazing mix of spices and herbs that go into its making. It is also the process and time and effort that goes into the preparation. You can taste the care and hard work that has gone into these amazing recipes. They really work hard to create this authentic flavor. If you know how to taste and love complex savory dishes. Then I highly recommend this place. It isn't impressive from the outside but the staff are great. The service was good, and the food outstanding. This may not be your cup of tea. But it is definitely worth a try. It is a great experience. I will be going back if I ever get the chance. I sampled everything I could. From the injera, to the lentils, from the fit-fit to the kitfo. It was all delicious. I cook, and since I started at 5 years old I have been trying different foods from every country and nationality possible. I honestly appreciated the hard work the cooks did to make this meal. The difference between a critique and a complaint is actually knowing what the food should taste like! Enjoy.",1
N5nB7bt89WYvobTGIP1vPA,"The environment is very authentic to what I would imagine to what an Ethiopian eatery would look like. The service was good, they worker are beautiful and the food was amazing and very well seasoned. I would definitely go back and would suggest this place to anyone who would like to expand their taste palette.",1
N5nB7bt89WYvobTGIP1vPA,"Absolute pleasure coming back to Empress. The Injera is the best I have ever had and that lamb, my gosh, I dream about it. Love the family atmosphere and authentic flavors. You must absolutely get the tasting menu, with different meats and vegetables. Don't by afraid to let go your comfort and try something new. It is sure to make you coming back for more.",1
N6qraRI63OZgrCAmWRX92w,This is one of my favorite Mediterranean restaurants in Cleveland. I just moved here from Chicago and I heard about the restaurant near my office on Superior.  When I heard about the new location I went there for breakfast and it was to die for. The hummus and Shawarma sandwiches are one of the most authentic Mediterranean dishes i've had at both locations. The food is great and the workers are one of the most friendliest people I've met.,1
N6qraRI63OZgrCAmWRX92w,"Really good authentic Mediterranean cuisine. Great falafel and spinach pie.
Great food 
Great service",1
N6qraRI63OZgrCAmWRX92w,Amazing food and amazing people!!! I am always satisfied with the food and service. The food always makes me full and satisfied and the price is good too! If you want authentic Lebanese food come here!!!! I'm here every week!,1
nbFAn60OmDt9reIRk8vilA,"The only thing that makes this place even close to authentic is that I SHOUT.  MY.  ORDER. SO. THEY.   CAN.  UNDERSTAND. ME.  But seriously, it's good, hot, local, well portioned and I don't go anywhere else for my take out Chinese food.  General Tso!",1
NBfhphIUcOgUpdf_QdDWvw,"I finally made it to Jezebel's and I must say... I'm glad I did!
I'll definitely be coming back to this place. I've never been to New Orleans, so I can't personally speak to the authenticity, but everything we had was delicious, stick to your ribs creole soul food!
Fried Green Tomatoes: Great! Good flavor, crispy but light batter, and the spicy sauce was delicious.
Alligator Voodoo: Worth a try. I'd never had gator before. It kind of tastes like chicken, but it's tougher, kind of like calamari. For obvious reasons, it's a bit pricey though. You don't get very much for $10. I'm glad I tried it, but probably won't get it again.

For my entree, I ordered the shrimp, crawfish, and redfish etouffee. I CANNOT say enough about this dish. It was very delicious. Spicy, but not overwhelmingly so. All the seafood was cooked to perfection. The roue was delicious. 

I also tasted the jambalaya and the paella. Both were excellent.

The service was also very good. 

I only gave 4 stars for 2 reasons: 1. The dessert was just so-so. I tried the bread pudding, which was very dense, although it had a good flavor, and the beignets, which were also fine, but denser than I'd like them. 2. The ambiance is more casual than the food. You feel like you're in a mardi gras themed TGI Fridays (with fewer decorations). Compared to the personality of other restaurants in the area, they would do well to spruce it up inside. 

Overall, fantastic food, and I can't wait to eat here again!",1
NBfhphIUcOgUpdf_QdDWvw,"Just the scent of the SAZERAC took us right back to NOLA, and the taste... well it was spot on! We loved our dinner at Jezabel's and will definitely return very soon. I had the SWEET & CRUNCHY PRALINE SALAD and ate every single bite. The combination of the flavors in the salad were absolutely delicious! My boyfriend had the Seafood Paella and enjoyed every bit of it. For dessert we shared Beignets and the Bread Pudding, both of which were scrumptious. To finish off the evening, an authentic cup of CafÁE© du Monde coffee was the perfect end to a great experience.",1
NBfhphIUcOgUpdf_QdDWvw,"We were really looking forward to trying out this restaurant.  We were in the mood for some creole food.  Too bad what we got was not authentic creole. It was like fast food creole, at best.   Although the server was very nice, that didnt make up for the very poor quality food.  The jambalaya that my husband ordered was missing most of the meat (no sausage and just a few TINY pieces of chicken) but mainly was a dry rice dish.  Very disappointing.  The P-Boy alligator sandwich was terrible.  VERY chewy alligator that had light breading falling off of it.  I didnt each more than 2 bites of the sandwich.  The fries that came with this dish were soggy.  Although the server saw that I didnt eat my alligator dish and I told her that I didnt like it at all, she didnt take it off of our bill or notify a manager (if one was even there).  The place was mainly empty on a Saturday night. That should have been our sign to turn around and find another place.  We will not be returning...",0
NBfhphIUcOgUpdf_QdDWvw,"Disclaimer:  I have never been to NOLA. So I suppose I've never had truly authentic Cajun/Creole cuisine, NOLA style. BUT damn. I really hope that this was it because it was SO good! 

Fake boyfriend and I went last night and we both thoroughly enjoyed our meal. 

We started off with a beer and a cocktail. I tried the Cajun Lemonade. Very interesting (with hot sauce!) and refreshing -- I'd definitely drink that again. 

For an appetizer we chose the pecan-crusted catfish -- delicious and you could tell that the fish was super fresh. We also got a Caesar salad because FB likes to try them almost everywhere. It was good. 

Entree was the Classic Cajun etouffee. WOW. The flavor of that dish was simply incredible. It included country shrimp, crawfish, and redfish ""seasoned w/ Creole spices and vegetables then smothered in a rich crab stock with red-brown roux and served over steamed rice."" I typed that out and a little bit of drool fell onto my keyboard. I can't recommend this dish enough. 

I really wanted to try a po' boy but I just didn't enough room in my stomach. Next time, for sure! 

Service was really great. Our server, Jake, took care of us splendidly. 

Only negatives were:  it was really loud inside, even though it wasn't overly crowded. Bad acoustics, I think. However, the dining room had cozy lighting and overall nice ambiance. 

We opted to sit outside on their street front patio. It was nice and they pipe music out there. Plus, you can sit and watch all of the yupsters who are out walking their dogs. 

LOVE Jezebel's. Can't wait to get my happy ass back to try more of their menu!",1
NBfhphIUcOgUpdf_QdDWvw,"We went to Jezebel's on a Sunday afternoon in August. Three sisters out to celebrate one sister's birthday. The decor is simple and really pretty, we took pictures of the New Orleans masks they were so gorgeous, we never take pix of decor. The restaurant was 3/4 full. The staff was VERY friendly, the owner came over and shared the story behind his place and he is clearly proud of it. 
The food was really good, having been to New Orleans many times I found it very authentic. I was disappointed that they were out of Jambalaya, since this is a staple I think I might have been at the store at 6:00 AM to pick up the supplies but we found other things to have. The salads were healthy and full of several types of lettuce which isn't always the case in Nawlins.We shared the mac and cheese which was delicious so creamy and thick! The alligator appetizer and fried green tomatoes didn't disappoint. I've had alligator that was greasy but this was perfect. I had the grilled chicken breasts with beans and rice, very good and so much I had the other half for lunch the next day.
The service was a bit slow but we weren't going anywhere and it was so friendly. If I were in a time crunch I would definitely mention it to the wait staff.
As we were leaving the owner came out and said goodbye. Wow! It's been a long time since someone cared that much about their customers. I will definitely be back, there's so much more to try!",1
nCSWoRbJnfhC9kEH5r1AXA,"Have been waiting for this Amazing venue to open. All I can say is WOW. SOO impressed by the food, drinks, service , all the above. The food was authentic, freshly prepared, and served by such friendly restaurant employees. The bar as well was amazingly knowledgeable about the hand crafted margaritas they were serving. Purely hand crafted!  And so delicious! Definitely will be back.  Barrio has nothing on this place",1
NgioF61Bs9YNLBg0o9I-Uw,"If you want original tasting asian food, this is definitely not the place to go. HOWEVER, if you want fresh tasting food, then give this place a try. You can mix and match your meat and vegetables and sauces.

A buffet comes with a endless salad bar as well. They are really busy at night. If you want authentic asian food, then maybe this is not where you want to go.

Overall, I would give it a 3.5 star.",1
Ni26IoQqRCy9iVeNV4vNFg,"I really don't understand all these stellar reviews. The grapeleaves I gave a second try and they were hands down the worst I've ever had. Mushy with no taste whatsoever. Their rice isn't even close to pilaf, its cheap. None of their ingredients are fresh or authentic. Its Aldi's. So considering that, its actually not a good price at all. The salads are good. We tried the big plate, the one on the front of the menu for 16.99, thinking that's their specialty it would be good. Nope, very underwhelming. No flavor at all in the grapeleaves and the shawarma was both confusing and tasteless. 

I would recommend making your own grapleaves or find a friend with a Lebanese grandma, see what good leaves really are.",0
NI75svhUpw1u0ClzrPFPCQ,"I like Grand China! It is by my work and sometimes we get take-out off the lunch menu. I always like whatever I get. I'm kinda partial to the kung pao chicken. Co-worker get's the egg foo yung. The lady is sad like is said, but sometimes she is happy. One time they forgot the egg foo yung gravy. If you want, maybe check everything. If they didn't forget the gravy I would have given it 5 stars cause I think it is good Americanese food. Obviously it is not delicious fresh authentic chinese food from China. This is your classic take-out ""chinese"" food, which we all know we like now and then. LOL and I like the egg roll.

Give 'em a try on your lunch break! Yeah she is hard to understand.",1
nIJr76IGIGS3nkmieY3Vow,"Delicious homemade Italian food served in very large portions.  The staff is welcoming and friendly.  The cannolis are a great way to wrap up dinner, if you still have room!  Cozy, authentic, and worth the wait.",1
nIJr76IGIGS3nkmieY3Vow,"We had a 6:30 reservation and did not get seated until a little after 7. The place was packed and while we were waiting in the rather crammed front area (that candy machine could not be in a worse place) I was starting to get a wee-bit concerned hoping that the questionable way things were going was not going to reflect on the quality of the food. When we were finally seated at first our waiter seemed somewhat curt, but he warmed up quickly. His name is Lenny (only works on the weekends) and I have to say by the end of the meal I was a big fan of Lenny's. Before I talk about the food I will say the only problem aside from the questionable reservation policy was the noise factor. As I mentioned above the place was packed and the volume of all of these voices some at the table found difficult to deal with especially if you are trying to hear what the person sitting across from you is saying. Here's the thing though the food is so unbelievably good that nothing else mattered once the food was served. The portions are beyond generous and the food arrived at the table hot which i am really a stickler about. For an appetizer we ordered the Breaded Calamari and it is the best I have ever had (don't be shy squeeze a little lemon on it you won't be sorry). It was not at all greasy and it was perfectly cooked and what a generous portion. For my entree I had the Eggplant Parmigiano and even before digging my fork into it I understood why it was a House Specialty. The eggplant was cooked to absolute perfection and their tomato sauce is to die for. You know how some tomato sauces immediately give you heartburn well you will not experience that with this otherworldly tomato sauce. I also love how the Eggplant Parmigiano is lightly breaded so it does not feel heavy. Every one at the table loved what they ordered and trust me when I say this is a table where if people do not like something they are not afraid to say it myself included. One person even commented it was the best meal they had ever had in Murray Hill and would go back again. To be fair the person also said the noise was a problem though at this point I am not sure what could be done about that. There is a patio in the back that is enclosed in winter and open in the summer and perhaps that is quieter. I have not been to an honest to God Italian restaurant in a long time nor have I been to a restaurant in quite some time that had its own personality and did not feel like another chain until tonight. I really felt like when my family used to go to The Spaghetti Company up on Som Center when I was a kid except that the food at Trattoria Roman Gardens was so much better. If you want authentic Italian do not hesitate to come here and if you have to wait to sit down know that it is more than worth the wait. And if you're lucky maybe you'll even get Lenny as your waiter. Trust me once he warms up you could not be in better hands.",1
nIJr76IGIGS3nkmieY3Vow,"Dear Little Italy, 

I officially give up.  I have eaten myself to death up and down Mayfield Rd in search of a *good* Italian restaurant that makes a great tomato sauce.  Fortunately (or unfortunately) I had high hopes for Trattoria on the Hill.  The cavatelli with extra tomato sauce was just plain mediocre.  So there you have it.  I'm officially done with settling for mediocre Italian in what is reported to be the most authentic Italian neighborhood in Cleveland. 

Sadly, 
Jen",0
nIJr76IGIGS3nkmieY3Vow,"the smell upon walking into this place is good enough for the 5 stars. the food is amazing. i grew up w/ authentic italian food and am quite picky when it comes to something as simple as marinara sauce. but this place is delicious and gets no complaints from me.
the atmosphere is cute- maybe a little crowded- but it's little italy so what else would you expect?",1
nIJr76IGIGS3nkmieY3Vow,"This is a truly authentic Italian - American eatery. If you're looking for the Olive Garden, go elsewhere. Everything here is incredibly fresh, homemade, created with care, and delicious. The fresh Italian bread and tomatoes that come with it are fantastic. I had heard from multiple people that their Eggplant Parmesan was amazing. Whereas, eggplant is not something I personally enjoy, my dining companion absolutely loved it.  It looked great, and I almost asked to taste it, but she was in such a delirious feeding frenzy, but I was afraid I would be bitten if I tried to steal a bite. I had the Chicken Piccata, which was also tasty.  Also, the portions were large, and I felt that the prices were fair considering how fresh and the size of everything.  Make sure to not skip dessert! They have Tiramisu that is by far the best I've ever tasted.",1
nIJr76IGIGS3nkmieY3Vow,Chose trattoria  for a birthday dinner did not care for it at all we ordered calamari and it was not fresh calamari that most authentic Italian restaurants serve it was the frozen type I don't think anything was fresh the eggplant we both ordered was swimming in sauce and was a layered mushy uncooked mess the service was poor as well we could have used more than one glass of water to wash down the disgusting food the only good thing was the fresh bread therefore I am giving a thumbs down,0
nIJr76IGIGS3nkmieY3Vow,"First let me say OMG!!! This place was Italian heaven! I was so thrilled with every choice we made! We got in a little after typical dinner time and just grabbed seats at the bar because the Tribe game was on. The amazing bartenders were so attentive and sweet, I wish I had gotten names, but the one woman was just the sweetest! We ordered an Eggplant Crostini app and I was a little nervous to try something listed as ""sweet and sour"" outside of Chinese food or candy but my boyfriend urged me to leave my comfort zone, and I am so thankful I did! It was delicious!! They also brought us the bread with this brushetta like tomato sauce, also amazing, but at this point I'm already close to full and my entree is still coming! I ordered the Shrimp Gnocchi and it was the largest plate of pasta I have ever seen and their cream tomato basil sauce was so good, I would swim in it! (Do you guys jar it for sale? Because I'll get in line!) My bf ordered the Chicken Piccata which he really enjoyed, he said it has to be the best he's ever had and he grew up eating it once a week! So what a compliment! And the portions are just so huge, I'm happy for that totally affordable price I am getting 3 meals. Also super thankful we had a long walk back to the car to walk it off! But even in my most stuffed and full state, I ordered 2 cannolis to-go because I'm in Little Italy and authentic cannolis are my weakness, I just ate it, just now, for breakfast (my birthday is tomorrow so stop judging, its basically the same as eating a donut for breakfast only wayyyy better) and it was perfect. Zero disappointments. No problems. No waiting (except on my bf to make up his mind). It was just a relaxing perfect meal!",1
nIJr76IGIGS3nkmieY3Vow,"This is a great little authentic Italian restaurant in the heart of Little Italy. We have been here a number of times, and it never disappoints. 

If you are an eggplant fan like I am, do not pass up the Eggplant Parmesan. Their version looks like a square of lasagna, and is thin layered slices of eggplant-- delicious from the first to the last bite. Planning a trip next weekend as we speak:)",1
nIJr76IGIGS3nkmieY3Vow,"Stopped by Trattoria last night with my daughter while my wife and son attended a Cavs game. I let my daughter pick the restaurant and I told her she could choose from steak, Italian, seafood, or Cajun. She chose Italian. Of course, I was thinking of the restaurants in Little Italy when I was offering Italian as an option. When we arrived in Little Italy, I played the parking game. When I finally finished the game, I hadn't won and we had a bit of a walk to get back to Mayfield Rd. We weren't sure which restaurant we wanted to visit, but we agreed on Trattoria because neither of us had visited previously. When we walked in, we were greeted and seated. Within a minute, we were given water, bread, and some crushed tomatoes with basil. Soon after, our waitress arrived and took our drink orders. I wasn't sure what to order, so I went with Chicken Parmesan, which I generally love. My daughter opted for beef ravioli. In a record setting three minutes, a young woman arrived with two plates of food that matched our order. I made the weirdest surprised face I could muster and said, ""Wow! That was fast!"" Since our food was not made to order, I wondered how good it would be. It ended up being very average - nothing special. It seems Trattoria takes the Mexican approach of advanced food preparation in feeding its patrons. The waitress mentioned that it wasn't as busy as most Saturday nights and they had three cooks working. Still, nobody can make an authentic chicken Parmesan in three minutes. It was tasty and I would eat it again, but if I'm going to drive to Little Italy for some scratch made pasta, I'm going to Valerio's or Mia Bella. I'm glad I visited though because my curiosity has been satiated.",0
nIJr76IGIGS3nkmieY3Vow,"With Trattoria, you really can't go wrong; considering the location as well as the dozen or so other Italian restaurants in Little Italy, the prices here are fair, the portions generous, and the service is attentive and efficient! I've tried practically everything on the menu, and have yet to be disappointed with the quality or taste!  I recommend sitting out on the patio during the warmer months, or on colder days you can find ample seating in the retro interior, which evokes images of 1940s era dÁE©cor.  ",1
nkubaPIxnt6ZYhjKsAe3yg,"-Delicious, fresh, authentic Thai food (we ordered the summer rolls w/ tofu as an appetizer and for mains I had red curry and my boyfriend had the mixed grill)
-Quick/friendly service
-Easy to use Groupon
-Full bar
-Would suggest they play music to improve ambiance (it was pretty quiet)

Overall a really good experience",1
nkubaPIxnt6ZYhjKsAe3yg,"Often when I read not-so-great reviews of a place I've loved, I wonder if I actually went to the same place the other reviews are about. 

On a Monday at 5:45, there was no one else at Lotus Thai House - so the service was quite superb. I guess when you're the only people in a restaurant, it's hard to get that part wrong. 

And the food... so it's been about 10 years since I've had actual Thai food (Because Pad Thai from Rocky River Brewing Co. can hardly be called real Thai. Umami Moto and Phnom Penh are probably closer, but I've always been seduced by their other dishes.)  -- so maybe my authenticity meter is lower, or maybe some of the other reviewers went on a bad night? 

Maybe we just got lucky -- because my boyfriend and I had a very tasty Thai dinner this early Monday evening. 

We started with the Lotus Curry Puffs -- two large and flaky, flaky, flaky deliciously fried pastries with ground chicken, sweet potato, cilantro, onions, and curry powder, with a sweet sauce - and a small bowl of Kuai Tiao (Don't let ""small"" fool you - it was easily enough for one meal really - even split between two of us there should have been some left over. [But there wasn't, because we were pigging out a little. Ok, a lot.].) Their Kuai Tiao is a lot like pho, and just as yummy. 

The boyfriend got the Pumpkin Curry - a little strange presentation I think, as it's served in a fried tortilla bowl (think taco salads) - but the contents (chicken, shrimp, and veggies with yellow curry) were delicious and prepared with care (yay for shrimp that isn't tough and rubbery!), and almost hot enough for him at the extra spicy level. (I sometimes think there's no such thing as too hot for him.) My Masaman Curry, medium spicy (I could have gone a little hotter) was even better - though I think it would have been better with beef. My own poor decision to go with chicken, as far as taste. The chicken was good chicken though - not the gristle laden chunks you end up with in so many Americanized Thai places. 

The only complaint I had at all was that the main dishes came out a little too fast on the heels of the soup and appetizer... we weren't even close to being done. I'll chalk that up to us being the sole patrons the entire time we were there though - I suppose the guys in the kitchen didn't have much else to do.

We stuffed ourselves thoroughly, and enjoyed every second of it. And though I have to admit there is a selfish part of me that enjoyed having the whole place to ourselves, I really hope that isn't the norm - this place should be packed for dinner. I know we'll be back for more! (Though maybe we'll stick to the early dinner to have it to ourselves...)",1
nkubaPIxnt6ZYhjKsAe3yg,"We had high hopes for this place, because we really wanted to be able to take applicants here for inexpensive Thai food.  But, we were, unfortunately, very disappointed.

So first of all, the additional star is because the waitress here was really friendly and attentive, filled our waters, and took good care of us.  When we did not finish our food she even asked us if we thought the food was okay.  We didn't have the heart to tell her what we thought of it.  

For appetizers we had the shrimp in a blanket (a fried shrimp dish with a crispy shell).  This is only restaurant that has ever served me shrimp in a blanket with mayo inside.  Frankly, the additional lumps of mayo inside killed the authenticity and made it taste like a stereotypical, westernized dish - crab rangoon.  We also had a pad thai, which was soggy and had a very strange flavor to it that quite simply turned us off.  We ended up not finishing it.  Also had a Lotus Thai fried rice - the rice was undercooked, but it was okay (luckily, because otherwise we would've gone home hungry).",0
nkubaPIxnt6ZYhjKsAe3yg,"I live in the Cleveland Heights area and have eaten at Lotus Thai House multiple times (both dine-in and take out).  The food here is always amazing and very authentic.  Portions are huge (leftovers always make for a great lunch the next day).  Prices are very reasonable.  This is a family-owned business, and we have always received the most kind and thoughtful service from the staff at Lotus Thai House.  Highly recommend!",1
nkubaPIxnt6ZYhjKsAe3yg,Wanted some good Thai food and had a groupon so I tried it. I've had better and probably wouldn't go back. It seemed authentic but I was disappointed. Food wasn't as flavorful.,0
nkubaPIxnt6ZYhjKsAe3yg,"Walked into a balmy dining room with an odd smell (like moldy wall or something?) Definitely not a fancy place, but definitely felt that authentic vibe. Had a very attentive server who was not too pushy or looking over the shoulder all the time. He was very patient when taking our orders and had a few good suggestions. Thumbs up to you my boy for suggesting those Curry balls as an appetizer.

These tasty morsels are about the size of palm, fried and flaky sort of like an empanada. Inside, curry stew with chicken, potato and aspirations of ordering seconds.

We ordered two dishes: minced basil chicken and classic chicken/shrimp pad thai. For the basil chicken, I felt it was quite lackluster in taste. Hardly spicy but nothing some good ol' uncle sriracha couldn't fix. The vegetable to meat ratio was like 50/50, never had bell peppers in this dish before. I thought could have used more meat.

Hard to go wrong with pad thai, but I thought this particular entrÁE©e was sweeter than I've had in my lifetime. 

I grew up eating rice with all my Asian dishes, and for the two of us, we were given a cup of white rice...a cup?",1
nPyYW0YymDzs8fqMnyO1fg,"We went in for lunch and we're very pleased with how things went.  Service was very polite, friendly, and fast.  We shared the Zoma Sampler with an extra order of mild chicken.  Ordering this kind of arrangement will get you all of the vegetarian dishes included (about enough for all 4 guests to have several bites of each).  The seasoning was very complex and fresh and from the the handful of times I've had Ethiopian food, authentic and not tweaked for domestic tastes.  Be prepared for a lot of flavor.  All 4 of us were full at the end of the meal, but not uncomfortable.  Everyone enjoyed the food, the service, atmosphere, and end result.  

A few notes.  Zoma is not priced well for lunch, just one menu for lunch and dinner.  They are very well priced for dinner.   This is not a silverware friendly restaurant, but if you feel uncomfortable eating food with your hands and injera (use your right hand), they will bring you forks/spoons.",1
nPyYW0YymDzs8fqMnyO1fg,"My first time having Ethiopian food, and it was quite the experience! I like how the restaurant tried to keep it authentic, and did not provide us any silverware other than for the coffee and tea. My friend and I were expected to use the injera bread to pick up the various stews and dishes, and we thoroughly enjoyed how the soft, spongy injera bread absorbed all the flavors of the dishes. My friend and I split the Zoma Special Combo, which came with beef tibs, spicy beef stew, mild beef stew, and 5 other vegetarian dishes. The spicy beef and cabbage were particularly good, while my friend loved the beef tibs. As for drinks, I got the Ethiopian tea whereas my friend got the Ethiopian coffee. The tea was very minty, and did not require any additional sugar. My friend loved the richness of the coffee, though it was way too black for me personally.

I love how the decorum is very traditional Ethiopian, right down to the tables we sat at. It was an excellent experience, and I would not mind returning in the future.",1
nPyYW0YymDzs8fqMnyO1fg,First visit to this fantastic restaurant. Incredible tasty food. We have combo dinner with 3 items. Enough food to share for 2. Also was tempted to order stuffed JalapeÁE±o and I did. Just great. Real authentic Ethiopian food. Best of all service from a ever smiley Tishita. What a pleasant person! Lee Road has many choices but this one we would go back to.,1
nPyYW0YymDzs8fqMnyO1fg,"The food at Zoma is just as good or better than any Ethiopian I've eaten across the country. 
The service was superb! 
Our food arrived quickly after ordering. We sat at one of three basket tables for the more authentic experience.  We had mild beef, spicy beef, red lentil, and cabbage. All were outstanding, but the spicy beef and cabbage were my favorites. The Ethiopian honey wine was a nice pairing with the spicy food. Will definitely be back to this nice addition to the Lee Road dining scene.

The TVs displaying an Ethiopian channel didn't add much to a Saturday night dining experience. Might be better suited to a lunch crowd. Based on food and service alone, I would have rated this restaurant with five stars but dropped one for ambience.",1
nPyYW0YymDzs8fqMnyO1fg,"The staff here is so kind, friendly, and thoughtful, and the food was delicious! The atmosphere feels authentic to the culture, and it is just a place where you will feel good, welcome... and full. Highly recommend!",1
nPyYW0YymDzs8fqMnyO1fg,"I've only had African in NYC and in DC.  I didn't think I'd be able to find an authentic one here, but I did (thanks to Yelp!)!!!  The only qualm I have is that the injera isn't *quite* as sour as it should be, possibly americanized, but it is still very good, and the texture is spot on.  I have only ordered on uber eats, but I do hope to actually go one day!",1
nPyYW0YymDzs8fqMnyO1fg,"When I lived in D.C., I loved getting Ethiopian food. Admittedly, this was my first time getting Ethiopian in Cleveland! I went with a group of Yelp friends and had a great time.

I had the mild chicken stew, which is served with injera and a house salad (not a real salad, more of a zesty tomato salsa). Injera is a thicker, sourdough type bread that you use to pick up bites from your entree. The portion of injera was very generous, and they even put extra on the table. I enjoyed the more sour taste to this injera, as it wasn't bland at all. The mild chicken stew, thought advertised as mild, still had a little kick to it and was cooked with egg. Overall, I was undoubtedly full and happy with my choices. My meal felt really authentic and comparable to the restaurants I would frequent in D.C.

The highlight of Zoma is really the beautiful set-up they have to recreate a traditional Ethiopian coffee ceremony. I'm not familiar with the exact cultural descriptions, but they have a lovely area set-up specifically for this ceremony that is built out of a live indoor tree. Once the ceremony is live in action, the restaurant fills with a smoky haze and delightful smells. 

Other observations: you really can't beat the prices here, especially for the portions and experience. Also, if you have a food allergy or restriction, you may want to ask quite a few questions, because I recall the menu descriptions being a little short. 

Bottom line: super authentic and enjoyable for adventurous eaters. Choose carefully on the menu!",1
nPyYW0YymDzs8fqMnyO1fg,"I have never had Ethiopian food before. Will I be coming back? Heck yes!

I loved the interior, bright and fun without being overly overwhelming. The service was fast. We got our waters and hand towelettes right away. 
The server we had was new but she brought over someone else who could answer our questions. 

My friend is gluten free so we wanted to make sure the injera the dishes come with was gluten free, it didn't say so on the menu. I did my research before hand and authentically injera is made from teff which is gluten free but some places mix teff with flour. The kitchen said they could do gluten free injera for an extra $3, sold!

I was excited to try all the things and so my friend and I ordered the Zoma Special Combo (32.99) which says it feeds 2-3 people. It definitely feeds more than two because both of us got to take home left overs! I highly recommend getting this particular combo if you've never had Ethiopian food because you honestly get to try so many dishes. Sadly we missed the coffee ceremony they have on Sundays 3-5 but I'd like to come back for it.

I loved most of the food! The one I wasn't a big fan of was the tomatoes but that's on me since I'm not a fan but I will say that did cut the heavy sauce taste nicely. The food seems simple and it's not like the flavors are immensely complex but there's something so delicious and satisfying about it. If I had to pick a favorite I think I'd go with the spicy beef stew, the chicken stew and the split yellow peas. The homemade cottage cheese cut the heavy sauce nicely as well.

I loved the injera, soft and spongy with a sour taste that goes perfectly with the food. The fact that the food is also on it makes it more delicious after the sauce has had time to soak in. 

The entire time was spent happily attempting to eat the food with our right hands. I found it difficult but being that I've never done it before that would make sense.

Would I come back here? Definitely!",1
nPyYW0YymDzs8fqMnyO1fg,"GREAT!! Ethiopian food at this restaurant. Service was on point from our waitress and the food can out quickly. The flavors of everything we had was rich and authentic. Can't wait to go back to Cleveland ,Ohio . and eat at this place again!!",1
ntkeyTQNc735Dr-yjGd_IQ,"This place always has the longest line at any food truck event, but the hype is lost on me. I tried three tacos. The traditional, the original fired up taco, and the big shrimpin taco. The traditional was supposed to be an authentic taco, but it didn't taste anything like it. I got it with beef and the marinade was super salty. The fired up taco had too many things going on for me to really enjoy it. The big shrimpin was the only one that I liked, but I don't know if I'd go again just for it. 

Can just one of these taco trucks make real Mexican tacos, please?",0
ntkeyTQNc735Dr-yjGd_IQ,"Born and raised in Southern California, I tend to have high Mexican food standards. I was really craving Mexican food so tried the Fired Up Taco Truck. The shrimp taco was sadly disappointing! Overbreaded popcorn shrimp, cole slaw (this does not belong in a taco ever!), cold corn, cold tortilla, and too much sauce. I loooove Mexican food, and sadly, my cravings were let down. If you're looking for authentic, keep your expectations realistic here.",0
NVC1MFGTobWxYcuo_z7BGQ,"An excellent meal all around.  We came late on a sunday night, so it was just us and another table, and some regulars at the bar.  The waiter was very knowledgable and gave us excellent service from start to finish.  He did a great job making reccomendations and describing certain dishes to us, and provided seamless service. The food was great too - we had a variety of pastas and all were fresh, authentic, and delicious.  At the end of the meal the Chef greeted us and asked us how our meal was, which I appreciated.

I would definitely come back here and reccomend it to anyone!",1
NVC1MFGTobWxYcuo_z7BGQ,"This places just breathes Little Italy.  When you walk in the door it looks like a small mom and pop Italian family restaurant.  Pasta smells fills the air and the wait staff is yelling directions in Italian to each other.  We really enjoyed the cozy restaurant environment.  

We arrived on a Friday night around 10:15pm and the place was bustling, it ended up taking around 30 minutes to get seated, which is surprising for a restaurant after 10pm.  If you have a larger dinner party be prepared to wait for a seat as the space has limited large tables.

Started the meal with a house recommended super Tuscan, sapaio, it was very very good.  If you like an Oakier wine you will love this wine.  Ordered the grilled calamari for appetizer.  I would definitely recommend the grilled calamari.  It is not the breaded style you see every else, instead it is fresh and grilled over an oven - it is much lighter and you can actually taste the calamari.  For the main entree, I ordered the squid ink seafood pasta with the whole lobster.  Having travelled to Italy multiple times, I can say this was one of the best pastas I have had.  Perfect al dente and the sauce was flavorful.  The seafood flavor did not overpower the overall pasta - right on point.

For dessert, we ordered the tiramisu.  Very good and would recommend for hose who enjoy a creamier dessert.  

Overall a great authentic Italian dinner experience.  I would definitely recommend - especially the squid ink seafood pasta.  Only downsides was the wait for the seat and no valet at the restaurant and we had to park a few blocks away(was not that comfortable at that time at night).  Will be back!",1
NVC1MFGTobWxYcuo_z7BGQ,"I I have been to etna over and over and have never been disappointed. Eli, Carlo and chef peppe are extremely courteous and professional. Not to mention the food is authentic as being in Italy. If you want a good authentic Italian meal you must try this place",1
NVC1MFGTobWxYcuo_z7BGQ,"If this is authentic Italian, then apparently my hubby and I are not fans of Italian food.  I ordered the mushroom risotto and received a perfectly cooked risotto that tasted like it had been mixed with Kraft powdered cheese!  It was just weird.  My hubby had the special...a spinach ravioli with an osso bucco sauce/topping.  It was tasty, but not great.  We ordered a dessert that was similar to tiramisu with a berry topping...I was expecting some fresh berries over mascarpone and lady fingers like the menu stated...what we received was fluffy cream over a lady finger with a day old strawberry slice on top...ok, but nothing special.  The best part of the meal was the heavy pour on the wine.  The wine was a great value...everything else totally over priced.  Hubby's review?  There was a place... with food ...and service and a great wine...that's it.",0
NVC1MFGTobWxYcuo_z7BGQ,"All around very very good. Pasta excellant. Service excellant. Bread excellant. Excellant homemade tiramisu. Small quaint authentic italian atmosphere. Reasonable prices. Good portions, not oversized, but enough for most appetites.",1
NVC1MFGTobWxYcuo_z7BGQ,"Best authentic Italian in NE Ohio.  Charming little spot.  Peppe, the chef/owner hand prepares everything in his tiny kitchen.  Friendly efficient staff.
A star above all the other restaurants in Little Italy.",1
NVC1MFGTobWxYcuo_z7BGQ,"One of the best Little Italy restaurant. If you want really authentic food you need to try this place. Real italian Chef From Sicily means real italian food.
A lot of places in Little Italy are Italian-american food. At Etna you can't find Alfredo sauce. So don't even ask.",1
NVC1MFGTobWxYcuo_z7BGQ,"We waited until we lived next to Etna for two whole years before trying it out...and now I'm wondering why we did! The chef is Italian and the food is  authentic. I had tortellini in a meat sauce which was actually more like meat with sauce. (That's definitely a good thing!) Overall, the food is okay; I don't feel like I have been made a regular. The prices are a bit high for the mediocrity that we were met with on our plates. 

The only thing that's a little weird about this place are the hours. I'm never sure when they will be open, but that seems to be the way a lot of Little Italy is. 
Our server was pretty fantastic as far as the whole recitation goes. He must have a steel trap of a memory to have all of those specials nailed. They were just hard to remember when he was done...I felt like I should have taken notes.",0
NVC1MFGTobWxYcuo_z7BGQ,"Etna is amazing. It's adorable and quaint. It can also seem very romantic without being even remotely stuffy feeling. I've been here a number of times and have always been incredibly impressed.

Etna is very small, and the space seems authentically Italian. The service has always been wonderful.

The food is always amazing! Their pasta is perfectly al dente, and their ingredients are fresh, of high quality and are used flawlessly. the servings are large and incredibly affordable. 

The have an excellent and affordable wine list as well.

I've been here with many people and have never heard a single complaint. 

I have spent time in Italy, and some of Etna's dishes are the closest I've ever had to authentic Italian. Be sure to check it out. It's fantastic!",1
NVC1MFGTobWxYcuo_z7BGQ,"Many good choices in Little Italy, but don't overlook Etna. Small but not cramped. Very authentic from the fresh seafood entrees that were the specials to our server who was very professional and born and raised in Sicily. Server was very knowledgeable about menu and wine list and was attentive but not overbearing, never rushed us although it was clear in such a small place tables are at a premium. We enjoyed the wine we ordered, blanking on the name but it was a Sicilian red. Now here is where you need to listen carefully, they are going to bring a basket of bread, and you may be hungry, but do not eat it all (although they'll gladly give you more) you're going to want to save it to mop up the sauces of whatever you order. This isn't a short review and Italian meals aren't meant to be short either. We started by sharing huge New Zealand mussels in a light sauce that was tomato based and thoughtfully seasoned. We then shared the spinach ravioli for our first plate that came in a tomato based cream sauce. Solid homemade pasta as you would expect in Little Italy. For my second plate I got squid ink spaghetti with a split lobster. My wife got a grilled swordfish in lemon herb butter and asparagus. Everything was delicious and all the seafood was obviously very fresh and perfectly cooked. Nothing worse than tough or rubbery lobster or overcooked swordfish especially when you're paying market prices. It was not cheap but the kitchen really respected and expertly executed the ingredients. At this point I wish I would have gotten a tiramisu to go or espresso but my wife got a 20 year old port and I got a Perroni (I tend to drink my desserts). Very cozy and well run establishment and a credit to the neighborhood.",1
NyMBCCwughxU_DeUj3MS3w,"So happy to finally have a tiki bar without having to drive to Cleveland or Pittsburgh! Spend time looking around and you'll notice so many great, authentic, retro tiki details--from the numerous Witco pieces to the pendant lamps from the original Kahiki in Columbus (R.I.P). Food was good, bar food yes but good bar food. The onion rings were a favorite among our table. Drinks were very good, with house-made syrups and authentic recipes that did not disappoint. Really looking forward to spending more time here!",1
NyMBCCwughxU_DeUj3MS3w,"So apparently there is a Tiki bar thing. Like...this is not just a themed bar, but one of many such themed bars. I always pride myself on writing reviews based on what the establishment claims to be. Meaning...I judge a Taco Bell based on how it does at being Taco Bell and not on the quality or authenticy of the Mexican cuisine. So, I did a bit of research on the whole Tiki bar thing and here are my thoughts. 

Environment
The whole Tiki/Polynesian nothing is pretty weak  at this place. There  is a little loung when you walk in with someone's old deck furniture and then a few lights  and tiki heads and such. My daughter and I stopped here because we were on the Hike and Bike trail and this is the only place to eat. Honestly, after walking in the door I wanted to head back outside. The inside is very dimly lit and she kept mentioning it.  Were it 9pm and karaoke in full swing, I would have expected this. But all of the blinds were pulled on a beautiful sunny day. Per Wikipedia, Tiki bars need not be dim and scary. The decore was more  like being in a dive bar on a pirate ship. We we're consistently bothered by several pesky flies that added to the experience. It seems like this place is intended to  be divey - sticky tables, silverware in fancy bins on the table, all gross things that make up a dive  bar
 Now this is all opinion, but not my cup of tea. 

Staff
The staff was great - all one of them. The greeter was the bartender was the chef...and I think probably the owner as well. He was nice, but in that sort of way that wasn't genuine. I think he worked really hard to make my daughter feel not so freaked out. It seemed a bit forced, but he did his job well. 

Drinks
The draft list was honestly really nice for a divey place like this...Rhinegeist and Great Lakes both had a tap. My Dortmunder, however, was not on point. I'm not sure if the keg had been there for too long or what, but it didn't taste right. And believe me....I know Dortmunder. Our server/chef/greeter was nice enough to swap it out for another option which worked out well. I did not try any of the super fancy drinks that Tiki bars are known for, but the menu of their pictures looked good. 

Food
All of that said, the food was really good. I ordered a chicken sandwich and it was perfectly cooked. The fries were fresh cut and crispy. The only odd thing was that the marinara for the cheese sticks tasted boozy....like someone spilled beer in it. My daughter actually tried it and said, ""what is this?"" I explained that it was dip for the cheese sticks. Her response, ""are kids allowed to have it?"" Odd, right?  The only down side was that an order of fries was $6. A little hefty in my opinion. 


All in all, I know there are specific people that will like this sort of place, but I'm not one of them. The food being cooked well saved the day, but the rest of the place was weird enough to ensure I won't be back.",0
NyMBCCwughxU_DeUj3MS3w,"As a tiki enthusiast, I was excited to check out a new-ish tiki bar somewhat close to where I live. I travel for work and try to visit every tiki bar I can find, so after Tiki Underground celebrated their first anniversary in business, I figured it was time to give them a try.

The decor is...interesting. Tiki meets sports bar? I was sitting near a big Carona sign promoting taco Tuesday and there were beer signs scattered throughout the bar. There were also signs promoting Keno, which took away from the tiki vibe. It was also super dark inside - and not in an ambiance building kid of way. 

I stopped in for Pusser's painkiller week and was pleased with my drinks. They tasted authentic but were missing any sort of flair - a paper umbrella could have added a lot to my little drink. 

My waitress seemed a little put out when we said we didn't want to order food. It seems like they have a lot of typical bar fare with some unique specials. 

I think this bar has a lot of potential. It's just having an identity crisis. Not sure I'd go back unless they focus more on the tiki and less on the bar.",0
NyMBCCwughxU_DeUj3MS3w,"We were in the area for a business trip and this was one of several places suggested to us by people familiar with the area. From the outside, it doesn't look like an appealing bar/restaurant but we had a fantastic time. 

It was surprising to find authentic Polynesian cocktails in rural Ohio but Tiki Underground did everything right. The food was equally good, especially the coconut shrimp. Will definitely be back one day.",1
nzOTw9xu1LfEQxGTykAGdA,"Really enjoy this market. My go to for fresh ginger, oolong tea, rice, soy sauce, edamame and summer rolls. Great prices on tea and produce. Love the reasonably priced fresh produce. My children love the Asian candies. Sometimes there is a language barrier when asking questions or help, but I enjoy the authenticity of the market. I buy all my chop sticks there and soup bowls for ramen or pho. They are located near my work, so I shop often during my  lunch break. They have fresh summer rolls, summer rolls and more exotic dishes ready to go for lunches.",1
o_une30mUUXlFdcud-cqWw,"I was bummed that they closed, and now very happy that it's opened again with new floors!

I love the food here -- it's authentic and flavorful, and I love the owners -- they are very nice people and make great recommendations (if you are new to Korean food and intimidated by the menu). 

If only the portion was bigger, I'd give it a 5-star, as it is smaller than other Korean restaurants in the area with similar price point.",1
o_une30mUUXlFdcud-cqWw,"I was so thrilled to see that this place reopened. It had closed just before I left Cleveland and opened just before I returned. 
Food is still as good and fresh as before. Their banchan is great. Soups are awesome. Spicy rice cakes are delicious. 
Fresh and authentic. So glad it's here!",1
o_une30mUUXlFdcud-cqWw,"This is one of my favorite Korean restaurants in northeast Ohio! They just reopened after being closed for 2 years. It's small and owned by a super nice Korean couple since 1984 (over 30 years!). 

The thing to know about small, family-owned Korean restaurants is that they usually specialize in a few dishes. 

Here, you have to get the beef bone soup (sulleongtang) and the barbecue! It's the only place in Cleveland that has BBQ grills in the table (with vents above each table). That's the traditional Korean way. And good sulleongtang is a real speciality in Korean cuisine. It tastes like home! 

I love this spot. It's authentic, no frills, good food, and homey.",1
o_une30mUUXlFdcud-cqWw,"So sad to see it closed. I've been going here over 10 years and the new place isn't what I expected.  It's not bad, but you can no longer cook your own bulgogi,  which is the reason I've always loved it. Hansol just seems like a ""trendy"" spot,  not the authentic family place I've loved for so many years.",0
o_une30mUUXlFdcud-cqWw,I am so glad they re open the restaurant! It a home -style authentic korean food. I like kimchi soup and squid the most. The owners are friendly too.,1
o_une30mUUXlFdcud-cqWw,"I had a Korean roommate back in Cali.  One day I smelled something horribly strong and rotten.  A smell so strong it could literally wake the dead.  As I dug through the fridge wondering what the hell had died in there I realized that it was the Kimchi.  Needless to say living with a Korean girl turned me on to some interesting foods.  This place is as authentic as you're going to find in CLEvage.  Great food, great prices, and a crappy location.  Most of the authentic Asian places around here all have that in common.  Seoul Hot Pot comes highly recommended.",1
o_une30mUUXlFdcud-cqWw,"Foodies looking for a cultural experience search no further! This Korean restaurant is as authentic as it gets. Over 30 years of experience in the restaurant industry and plenty more from cooking at home aren't something you can fake.  My parents used to come here back in the day, and as we were driving through town we were pleasantly surprised to see that one of our favorite restaurants is still thriving. 

The ingredients in the banchan (appetizer dishes) were fresh and delicious. We ordered two soups, barbecue beef, kimchi pork, roasted fish, and all of it was reminiscent (or better, but don't tell them!) of my parents' and grandparents' cooking, and at a reasonable price to boot! The owners are super friendly, so don't hesitate to ask any questions about the menu. Looking forward to my next excuse to drive through Cleveland to feast on some Korean cuisine.",1
o_une30mUUXlFdcud-cqWw,"Outstanding! This place is so fun. Family owned, so authentic, such wonderful people. The food is fantastic, the menu is pretty well translated for us English speaking people. The grill in the middle of the table was fun and made it a unique night out for the whole family. I can't wait to come back and try more menu items. If you're even slightly considering this place, stop now and get there.",1
o_une30mUUXlFdcud-cqWw,"I will be honest I did not just eat here recently.  I have been going to this restaurant and ordering take out for over 10 years - at least once a week.  I love this place as well as the people that own it.  My first experience was when their daughter was the waitress, maybe 1999 or so.  She guided us through the menu.  I have tried food that I never would've tried had it not been for the owners.  We have developed a great friendship.  We moved from the area in 2011, NC, and miss having authentic Korean food from Seoul Hot Pot.  We've tried other Korean restaurants, but nothing calls me back like Seoul Hot Pot.

Price range per person depends on food choice.  The soups are served in large bowls so don't let the price scare you from trying them.  Parking in primarily on the street with a small lot behind the restaurant.  Between the dimsum and your entree you can walk out of the restaurant for about $25 with tip for two - again depending on your order.",1
O2-K859oBGBMgiKigZr_JQ,"You don't want to park here. Park on a side street and walk. The parking lot is the width of a grain of rice, and just as long. Someone will hit your car, and they won't care. 

In contrast to Asia Food Co., Good Harvest is nearly impossibly crowded and cramped. The aisles are just large enough for one, and quite often, you're trying to pass two. There are quite a few specialty foods which make it a worthwhile trip, if you're looking for things that are authentically Asian. 

It's -- for me -- a once-a-year store that I psyche myself up for a day or two ahead of time so that when I enter, I get in, and get out.",0
o4HbgQnUkYnTLsbb6K5hjg,"As much as I appreciate The Velvet Tango Room, I think I would pick the Society Lounge if some crazy, all-powerful person forced me to choose only one Cleveland ""speakeasy"" for my high-end, old-fashioned drinks. (Why would they even bother to do that? I don't know, I said they were crazy.)
Like the Velvet Tango Room, the drinks at this E. 4th establishment are authentic with top-notch ingredients and bartenders that take great pride in their work. But here the prices are lower -- even taking into account having to pay for parking unless you live downtown. We recently stopped in after a Cavs game and I had a Delicious Sour and Jeannene had a French 75 (both $12). My Sour had the necessary sour but it wasn't mouth-puckering and the foam on top from the egg was only slightly more substantial than air. Jeannene's French 75 also showed a deft hand as it wasn't too tart, either.
High Society also has a decent-sized appetizer menu with non-outrageous prices (another plus for them over Velvet Tango Room). We ordered the pistachio-crusted goat cheese medallions ($9) and got three the size of small burgers. The crunch and umami flavor of the nuts went well with the creamy tanginess of the cheese and, if that wasn't enough, drizzled on top of was a mixture of honey and balsamic glaze that had us wiping down the plate with the pieces of baguette that came with it.
Lastly, as much as I dig the atmosphere at Velvet Tango Room, I enjoy High Society's even more. Set in the basement, it is almost all exposed brick and very little lighting, except for around the bar. Your body can't help but start to relax no matter what event or crowded restaurant you just came from.
I wouldn't deal with downtown traffic or pay for parking just to come here but I would definitely add it to the itinerary if I was already planning to be around E. 4th.",1
o4HbgQnUkYnTLsbb6K5hjg,"Shout out to Amanda, our server, who was/is amazing! We had a party of 6 and were lucky to be able to have one whole corner of the bar to ourselves. I love the ""against the rules"" feel of this place as it is in the basement of the building. It feels like we are entering a secret location- I am one for the trend of the Prohibition era bars. 

I appreciate bars that make drinks from scratch. Believe me, I love a good vodka tonic but every once in awhile I love a true authentic French 75 or Manhattan. I love that both bartenders and servers here will let you try different liquors or drink concoctions so that you taste the different flavors in each drink.",1
o4HbgQnUkYnTLsbb6K5hjg,"This is a weird place and I've been here a couple of times.  The entrance is really promising how you have the nice walk downstairs to the actual space.    The decor however is a hodgepodge of I don't know what.  It's part modern cocktail lounge, part piano bar, part dingy basement feel in a random person's house, but with very little of that 1920s-40s old school speakeasy allure or nostalgia, IMO.  The drinks have always been pretty good and strong with a large selection of whiskey, gin, or vodka, etc., based authentic cocktails.  However, I almost always get this odor of mildew/mold emitting from somewhere every time I go...again back to the dingy basement descriptor.  It's hit or miss in terms of if it will take forever to get served or noticed, or if the bartenders/servers will be rude and annoying acting like this is NYC or South Beach.  If you hit it right and all the stars align in terms of service/no odor then this could be a good time.  It's a potential good date spot to take a girl who is a little green and has never really experienced a true speakeasy with a subtle entrance or any kind of potentially cool downstairs bar.  Her mind would be blown.  But, every time I have gone there's been something off and the decor/ambiance is a factor for me.  Meh.",0
OA5Li3ySzhrbG_WvD_QGYA,"Barrio is amazing! I have never had anything here I did not like. The tacos are amazing and very original. I've never had tacos like this before. They don't claim to be authentic street tacos- they market their brand as something original and it's definitely working for them! The line is insanely busy during peak hours so I recommend going at like 3 pm on a weekend day if you don't want to wait.  I love their patio and in their main seating area they have awesome skeleton art and a charming fireplace which they actually turn on when its cold out. You can make your own tacos or try one of their amazing suggestions. I noticed they recently added peppers next to their sauces so if you can't handle the heat, you know what to stay away from. After writing this review I am now craving their dirty taco! Might have to stop by this weekend...",1
OA5Li3ySzhrbG_WvD_QGYA,"It has been three days and I am still unnerved about the tacos and the service I had....lets start with the service. A bartender too busy to make eye contact for ten or fifteen minutes gives us menus to fill out, we had to finally ask him, ""would it be alright if we placed our order now?"" after a second interminable wait. He grimaced and said it might take a sec.

But forget the service...they took our orders, which included refried beans and it was not until our food actually came out that we were told refried beans (they offer two kinds) are no longer offered because they were, ""drying out too much.""

So, the ambiance is awesome. Truly a marvel, very beautiful and authentically Mexican decor. It may be the coolest feeling dining room I've ever been in.

The food----seriously!!!!!! $3 bucks per taco---one little bite of meat and a hardly filled and very not heated up shell. Whether you get crunchy or soft, (we got both) they will be cold shells. The chicken, you had to keep picking the cartilidge out of your mouth. The beef, it was so stringy it all came out in one bite and only the hungriest diner would bother to chew it long enough to get it into your eating tube. The pork was best, tho it was lukewarm and you begin to wonder about health and safety.

Do not go there to eat. Go there to hang out, have a drink (their margaritas are mainly triple sec) so get a top shelf margarita and some friends but do not order food.",0
OA5Li3ySzhrbG_WvD_QGYA,"I am a slave to this restaurant.

No, seriously. I just moved to CLE 6 months ago, and this is the restaurant I've visited most (excluding Chipotle). Here, dig this:

Bro: ""Let's grab something in Tremont.""
Me: ""Sure what?""
Bro: ""Hmmm... Let me look on Yelp.""
...
Bro: ""Barrios?""
Me: ""YES.""

Please bear in mind my use of ""Bro"" is inclusive of the female sex as well.

Aside from being ridiculously cheap, the tacos are amazing. Californians should go in understanding these tacos are far from authentic, but are supremely delicious. I usually order 2, since the tacos run large.

Green Goddess is my personal favorite shell; any of the proteins, salsas, etc., you can't go wrong. If you don't like your taco messy (it will be anyways), you can write to have your sauces served on the side on the order form.

The margaritas are served on the rocks, and come highly recommended.

Be warned, it gets SUPER crowded, regardless what day of the week it is. Prepare to stand in line for 30 or so minutes.

Note: The chips that come free are excellent. If you want some of the best guac in town, get a side of guac dip. The cheese dip is also great.",1
OA5Li3ySzhrbG_WvD_QGYA,"By far my favorite taco place in town! Definitely not an authentic Mexican food experience by any means but the quality is great. The tacos are quite cheap for how large they are - starting at $3. Monthly guacamole, queso, and taco options are always creative and delicious. Always endless possibilities for tacos as you can pick and choose exactly what you want in them.  The wait can be a bit long depending on what time you arrive, but the food usually comes quickly once you place your order. I would highly recommend Barrio to someone who is visiting Cleveland and looking for a delicious, reasonably priced restaurant!",1
OA5Li3ySzhrbG_WvD_QGYA,"I was disappointed by the tacos here, I prefer authentic Mexican tacos but am always open to try new kinds...of the 5 tacos we ordered two were okay and three were pretty gross - a very americanized version of tacos I guess - also they were quite large for tacos. The marg's were okay, the chips and guac also just okay. Overall, I wasn't too excited and probably won't bother going back on my next visit.",0
OA5Li3ySzhrbG_WvD_QGYA,"Came here a few more times since my last review, once for dinner on a Monday, once on Sunday for lunch.

The service is still pretty decent. A lot of people have been discussing the flavoring problem (salt), but for me, I haven't had any experiences where it wasn't salty enough. Now that I've come back a few times, I think Barrio is trying too hard to make some of the taco combinations work. Some of the cheeses don't match up well with the flavors and for some reason, they don't taste authentic to me. Some of the sauces are creative, but they are on the odd side. I don't understand the strawberries and jicama combo when most of the flavors on the tacos are savory. I appreciate the desire to be the happy dog of tacos, but some of the flavors just aren't working out.

I think they also changed their fish taco to a shrimp taco. It's ok, but I miss the fish!

I do appreciate the cheap prices, but if you're not careful, it will get expensive fast!",0
OA5Li3ySzhrbG_WvD_QGYA,"Honestly, this is some of the best ""Mexican"" food I've had in Cleveland. It not authentic by any means, but I love the way it is set up. Build your taco with some great choice like quest fresco, house made chorizo, and the dipping quest for the chips is awesome. I really loved this place and I plan to be a frequent visitor.",1
OA5Li3ySzhrbG_WvD_QGYA,"I finally caved to the hype that is Barrio, and I will say that it was just as hipster and culturally appropriated as I expected it to be, but gosh darn those tacos were delicious. 

I'll start by saying that coming at 7pm on a Friday night when I was nearing the point of ""hangry"" was probably not my finest hour of planning, but I came hopeful that I might be able to snag a  few spots at the bar. After putting in for two with the hostess, and were informed there were 16 parties ahead of us, we took a buzzer and made a beeline for the bar. I will say it was a little annoying that there was barely room to stand near the bar, while still allowing room for the servers to get by with loaded trays,  but with salted margaritas in hand, we waited patiently. We ended up getting lucky and snagging two spots at the bar as two people were just leaving. 

The bartender was really friendly and attentive even though they were clearly really busy, she didn't really take the time to explain the concept of the menu, but it seemed pretty explanatory (choose your own shell, meat, toppings and sauce; they also have suggestions on the menu if you feel overwhelmed by all the possible combinations). I ordered two beef tacos and a fish taco, along with some chips and guacamole to start. The chips and guac came out really fast....like freaky fast, which surprised me considering how busy it was. I didn't expect much of the guacamole, but I am happy to report it was really, really good guacamole, and the salsa was amazing as well. They kept the chips coming as well, which again was impressive considering how busy it was. 

The tacos came out shortly after, wrapped in tin foil (very convenient to avoid making too much of a mess). I had chosen the ""white widow"" variation for my shell, which included a flour tortilla, guacamole, sour cream, and a ""crunch with a kick"" (still not sure what that was, but it was delicious). The beef was shredded and super tender, and it was really nice that you could choose your own toppings, although it could be a little overwhelming for a first-timer. The fish tacos were mediocre in my opinion, but it could be because the toppings I chose didn't compliment the fish well. 

As for the margaritas, they were perfectly fine; I've certainly had better at cheaper, more dodgey looking Mexican restaurants, but it was nice that they had a lot of flavors to choose from. I think they were just a little sweet for my taste. 

As a whole, I really enjoyed my visit to Barrio, although next time I hope to come when it is perhaps a little less busy, I was really impressed with the service I received despite the fact that it was so busy. If you were on the hunt for ""authentic"" Latin American food, this certainly would not be it, but I would definitely come back and recommend to others because the food & service did not disappoint.",1
OA5Li3ySzhrbG_WvD_QGYA,"I really like Barrio, it's a great place to go for happy hour! The deal is til 7pm in the bar area and it's $1 off tacos and half price margaritas. 
Don't expect to find authentic Mexican tacos here but instead really tasty Americanized Mex.  The tacos are large, you can make a meal out of 2, but I usually get 3 because there are so many choices and I can't choose just 2.  The guacamole is on the small size but can still be shared.  Oh, and as an extra bonus they even bring out free chips and salsa!",1
OA5Li3ySzhrbG_WvD_QGYA,"There is perhaps no greater indictment against Cleveland's reputation as a ""food destination"" than our continued celebration and support of Barrio, a local-chain (with 3 locations in a 5-mile radius -- whyyyyy?!) that your suburban parents will definitely love. No authentic corn tortillas even offered here - just your basic-ass flour tortillas and the Ortega-style ""hard tacos"" that you were served as a kid. Welcome to the comfort and conservatism of Cleveland dining. 

Also, an honest question: why is it completely acceptable for us white folks (who the Barrio owner/operators are) to appropriate Mexican culture to such a high degree?  Mexican folk-art is plastered all over these locations. If I were to, say, open a bastardized African restaurant (like Barrio's bastardized ""Mexican"" restaurant), would it be acceptable for me to have African tribal art all over the walls? (No, it would not - it would be creepy and weird).",0
oB-1Xd915B9dQY2HhqfWsA,"I really love places like these, despite their lack of ""grittiness"" and ""authentic Cleveland appeal."" I stepped into this oasis of smoothies, salads, rice bowls, and pitas yesterday while in the area and was very soothed, if that makes sense. I love smoothies, and I realize I haven't found a place in Cleve-o devoted exclusively, or at least partially, to making them.  

Not to say that I want a Jamba Juice on every other corner or anything.  But I like smoothies and don't always feel like making them myself at home.  'Cause I'm not really into keeping acai berries around the apartment.

This place was kind of a faux-hipster haven, though.  People dressed up like they walked out of the movie 'Singles' although undoubtedly not as poor...using wi-fi like it was their job.  Well, it definitely could have been related to their job.  But whatever. 

It was only after walking out of there and back on yelp that I read reviews of this place (albeit, not this location) and that many people think highly of Liquid Planet.  I was surprised, because it's so shiny and has a west-coast vibe that I thought some people might be turned off by it. (I wasn't...but I did chuckle a little bit while inside.) People have a lot of good things to say about their food as well as their smoothies.  If I lived in Cleveland Heights I would be stopping by at least once a week.",1
ObelBwE40B5oYm2aA8yTjw,"I've been here a number of times with my parents. They love it. My mother is a harpist and they love Irish stuff, though they don't drink. WHich is just weird.
So there's an Irish motif here, but it's Ohio-Irish. I live in Boston and have been to Ireland and if you're looking for authentic, I'm not sure this is your place.
That said, it's nice. They are on the lake, have a nice view and patio. Their food is reasonably priced and tasty.
I got a corned beef boxty with a side salad. Salad was good - bigger and more interesting than most side salads. The corned beef was excellent - really good. The potato pancakes were good - not my thing, but good.
Also, service is usually pretty good",1
ObelBwE40B5oYm2aA8yTjw,"Great view! Great food! Great service!

Stopped in for a second time after my first introduction for a friends birthday dinner. Was pleasantly surprised then! Split the veggie boxty and fish n chips with a friend. Both were perfectly portioned! (They split both up on our own plates before serving) this time I got the corned beef boxty, delicious! And my mom got the fish n chips-""the best she's ever had"" the food is fantastic, authentic Irish (soda bead is amazing), the atmosphere is great, the staff wonderful and the view doesn't hurt! This is definitely my new favorite spot, did I mention I live in Tremont and passed places to come here? Ummm",1
ObelBwE40B5oYm2aA8yTjw,"If you want an authentic Irish pub experience in Cleveland, this is where you need to go. A fresh pint o' Guinness and a corner beef sandwich, and your belly will be full and your heart will be happy. Sit outside on the back patio and watch the traffic drive slowly down the shoreway towards downtown Cleveland and soak it all in. A beautiful vantage point of the downtown from the near West side will be your canvas as you enjoy the Irish pub atmosphere, great food, good beer selection, and friendly staff. Out of the many ""Irish"" pubs in Cleveland, this is one of the oldest and most authentic, definitely worth your visit.",1
OBiEUhHNYMWKuqb6yPVDDQ,"So my beloved Athens Pizza was closed. They're on their annual vacation much to my chagrin. So I decided to try Pizza fan which is only a block or two away from where I stay. The pizza was okay but definitely not like Athens or other authentic pizza joints. The wings however were better then expected. They were jumbo and worth the price. The only complaint I have is they were a little undercooked. I guess I should have known when I ordered at 7:30 and my food was already here by 10 to 8. Unfortunately due to Athens being closed I had to suck it up and try this new place, you live and learn. Probably will not order again, but i guess if imur in a pinch itll due.",0
OD2dbQTKN7FS01fHzZqqzA,"I've been to both excellent and really dumpy places by now. I was honestly very impressed with the Barrel Room. Everybody was polite and agreeable from the start. They happily accommodated a birthday cake I brought with me -  which they refrigerated and brought out right after dinner, complete with extra plates and forks. The checks were split by default for a large group, which, if you've ever been with a large group, you'll understand how easy it makes your life. The beer list is extensive, the drinks are quality, and the food instantly teleports you way down South. It was busy yet roomy on a Saturday night. The atmosphere is unique for Cleveland; the art on the walls, the architectural details such as gas lamps inside and in make for a cozy, authentic experience. I already can't wait to come back here.",1
OD2dbQTKN7FS01fHzZqqzA,"This beautiful spot missed out on a higher star value because the service wasn't great. The atmosphere and food is amazing. You feel like you've transported out of Ohio! The architecture is beautiful and the menu has core Creole and Cajun dishes, but is plentiful enough for even your pickiest friends. The drink list is vast and authentic, and the happy hour prices are good even for Tremont. The drinks, however, do take way too long to make; every bartender seems to use a jigger for every single drink instead of counting their pours. Really frustrating to wait 5 or more minutes just for a mixed drink. 

I've been in several times and usually have sat at the bar. The bar staff mingles with patrons I assume to be regulars, and I've never really felt very welcome. This isn't a huge issue, but it's a personal preference to have a wait staff that tries to build ""regular"" customers out of first time visitors.",0
OD2dbQTKN7FS01fHzZqqzA,"I have been to this restaurant twice and have been disappointed both times. 

First encounter: 

My husband and I planned a dinner out with another couple and their children, selecting this place because NOLA is sentimental to all of us. Understanding that a table for 6 in Tremont can be difficult to wrangle, we called at 2:00 pm the same day to secure a reservation. We were told that a 6:30 reservation time wouldn't be needed because  that time is well before the restaurant ever gets busy. 

When we showed up at 6:15, the restaurant was packed. Two of us had arrived, so we tried to put ourselves on the list to be seated. The gentleman at the hostess stand told us we had to wait because he ""had something else to do"" and someone would be with us soon. Ummmmm, OK. 

The lady who came over a few minutes later told us we couldn't request a table until 75% of the party is present. We asked how long he expected wait would be once our party arrived, and the estimate was 20 minutes . That would have been fine if we had not been told earlier in the day that we wouldn't need a reservation. We explained our earlier interaction to the hostess, and were told that the restaurant doesn't even accept reservations. Wait, what?? 

Once our party arrived at 6:30, we were told 30 minutes. We went two rounds, trying to explain why we were upset. The hostess didn't try to make the situation right or even offer an apology for the confusion. We walked outside to discuss other restaurant options in the area, and ultimately decided not to stay. Upon walking into the hostess area to remove ourselves from the list, the hostess told us that a table just came available. Sadly, the 75% of our party was already in the car and on their way to the next spot. No effort was made to walk the 6' outside, where they could obviously see us standing, to tell us we would be seated 

I understand that policy is policy, but the ENTIRE staff needs to understand the rules if they're going to be enforced.

Second encounter:

I got talked into trying again because my husband dying eat here. The staff was much better this time around. The food is not good. I had a $17-ish plate of shrimp and grits and guess what...? This place doesn't know how to make grits, not even expensive ones. There was very little flavor and the texture was like mashed potatoes. I realize that I live above the Mason Dixon line, but this isn't a difficult dish to make. The hush puppies were mediocre and far too small to be authentic. I really wanted to try the bread pudding, but I was afraid of being disappointed again.

OD2dbQTKN7FS01fHzZqqzA,"This place is amazing, and the atmosphere is great. The feel of New Orleans is authentic as well as the food. The food is top notch and really good. The place is laid back and friendly. They have good specials and priced really well!",1

OD2dbQTKN7FS01fHzZqqzA,"So I yelped this place after arriving  in Cleveland on a business. My group and I decided to give it a shot. Upon arrival Your greeted with An authentic New Orleans/Butbon Street structure. The interior is definitely a nice vibe, perfect for a friendly gathering or an intima. Our waiter was attentive and handled our party of 9 without a problem. He ended up giving us the full run down of the menu and gave us suggestions. I ordered the Painkiller cocktail and it was nice and strong. The crab cake was amazing and obviously made with real crab meat. For my Entree the Shrimp and Frits was to die for. I highly recommend this place!!!",1
OD2dbQTKN7FS01fHzZqqzA,"The food was incredible, the atmosphere is darling too. I'm a fan. I had a trio of red beans and rice, jambalaya and gumbo. All were incredibly authentic full of flavor. I also had a flight of beers and went with all Abita's they had on tap. This is a great feature so you can sample things before you buy a beer you wouldn't drink. Kid's meals were beyond what you typically find on a kids menu. They ate it up plus they got a beignet for after dinner treat that is included with all kid's meals. Great place.",1

OD2dbQTKN7FS01fHzZqqzA,"Go HERE for your next dining out experience! As a Buckeye living away, I tend to follow a lot of news about my old hometown. Lately, I have seen a lot of ""press"" devoted to raving reviews about BSBR. Since FOUR of us all decided that this place had promise (and this family rarely agrees quickly on where to eat), we figured it would be OK. OK? Oh, no, it is most excellent!

Two in our party have spent time in The Crescent City. They both said this place replicates authentic Cajun cooking. Son gave the Muffaletta two-thumbs-up. Hubby (and daughter) had the Crawfish Etouffee and made yummy noises the entire time. I had the BBQ Shrimp and Grits. ""BBQ"" is a misnomer, since this in no way resembles a sauce-drenched dish. Perhaps it refers to the heat of the dish - lots of it, but definitely not tongue-burning. All I remember was it was very good, and loaded with nice-sized shrimp. Loaded, I tell you!

I've told you how wonderful this place is. I told owner Justin Clemens how wonderful this place is when I had the pleasure of speaking with him and his associate Craig. Now YOU go to BSBR and find out for yourself how wonderful the food and atmosphere is. It's like C-town just got a little bayou on the North Coast.",1
OD2dbQTKN7FS01fHzZqqzA,"I visited on a night when they randomly lost power for a bit. The staff was amazing calm, professional and even took my number to call me when the power was back on and they were seating again.

OD2dbQTKN7FS01fHzZqqzA,"OVERVIEW: Considering I've done a lot of dining in New Orleans,  I can definitely say that the cuisine here is equivalent to, if not better than, the majority of the places I've been. The ambience makes you feel as if you're in a classy place in the French quarter, with gas lamps, balconies, and Fluers de Lis on the walls.
DRINKS: The draft beer list is extensive, offering unique selections... don't pass up Abita's, an excellent Louisiana beer that comes in multiple flavors (Pecan was my favorite). And of course you should try an authentic Hurricane, too.
FOOD: Many New Orleans favorites to choose from. Hush puppies were THE BEST I've ever had. The jambalaya was also really fantastic and the Crispy Poullet po' boy was tasty. 
TO SUM IT UP: Attention to detail makes this place stand out. I really enjoyed it and would definitely recommend it to others, whether they've been to New Orleans before or this will be their first ""trip.""",1
OD2dbQTKN7FS01fHzZqqzA,Went to Bourbon Street Barrel Room to check out their happy hour. Awesome prices on drinks and starters. Bowl of gumbo was only $3.50 and was fantastic!  I used the CLEseats app and got 15% off my total bill. The menu is fun and the food was very authentic. Great location. I love the Tremont area in the summer.,1
OD2dbQTKN7FS01fHzZqqzA,"Surprisingly authentic food from the Pimm's Cooler through the Beignets. Of course the seafood isn't as bountiful or fresh as it is on the Gulf, but the basic recipes are intact. Service was pleasant and the space is beautifully designed.",1
OD2dbQTKN7FS01fHzZqqzA,"The only thing better than the food here is the atmosphere. It's been years since I've been to New Orleans but this restaurant felt absolutely authentic to me. Or, perhaps even better, it felt like a nostalgic fantasy of the city, complete with flickering gas lamps and wrought iron railings. 

Beauty of the restaurant aside, the food is amazing. Come hungry and expect to leave just a little too full. They serve dishes laden with hearty food like shrimp and grits, jambalaya, gumbo, and red beans and rice. If you like cajun and creole cooking, you'll like BSBR's take on classics. If you've never experienced Louisiana-style cooking, this is a good place to start. 

Intimate and cheerful, this can easily be a romantic spot. With two bars and two levels of seating, I suspect you can also have a great time with a large group of friends.",1
OD2dbQTKN7FS01fHzZqqzA,Excellent service. Prices very reasonable. Food was delicious. I've been to New Orleans and this was as close as you're going to get in Northeast Ohio to the authentic flavors of NOLA! The shrimp and grits were excellent. Our table shared desserts -the Beignets and Bread Pudding. Very tasty!,1
OD2dbQTKN7FS01fHzZqqzA,"When your happy hour starts during the lunch hour, it's hard *not* to be a fan. 

I'd like to get the obvious, previously-stated things out of the way, which are: 

- It's a gorgeous space. Like... really, really visually pleasing. I loved the dim lighting, accented by what I'm assuming were gas-powered lamps at each booth. Also, the high ceilings with decorative, metal ceiling tiles were gorgeous. 

- The lunch service was phenomenal. Our waitress was adorable, talkative and knew the menu very well. My lunch date (my Dad) always has questions about wines, which tends to throw some servers off. She handled it like a champ and I appreciated her depth of knowledge of both the food and drink menus. 

Now on to the other stuff--like food and drinks! My uncle lives in Louisiana--Baton Rouge to be exact. And I've spent a few vacations eating my way through NOLA and all the Cajun/Creole grub I could get my little fangs on. With that being said, I appreciated the authentic options, including muffulettas, po'boys, gumbo, and my personal favorite dish, jambalaya. 

My dad scarfed down the muffuletta like there was no tomorrow, so I'm assuming he wasn't lying when he told me it was delicious. He also had a cup of the gumbo--same story there for Mr. Clean Plate Club. I tried the lunch portion of the jambalaya. It was served with more of a dry-spice technique, adorned with spicy sausage and pulled hunks of what tasted like smoked chicken. The dish was tasty, just not what I've come to expect from a slightly more tomato-based jambalaya. I will also add that while the dish was spicy, it did not pack heat. A perk for some, but not as much for a heat-hound like me. Overall the dish was just a little dry for me. 

Price and serving sizes have me a little thrown, since my dad's meal was perfect. The price and portions were spot on. Did I mention they have a happy hour drink menu during lunch? Yes, please. But my dish was not as spot on. For the portion size I felt the $10 price tag was a bit hefty.

I'd definitely come back to try more of the menu items, especially for dinner and drinks. And I want to add that although I didn't love the jambalaya, to each their own! Don't let my opinion keep you from trying it.",1
OD2dbQTKN7FS01fHzZqqzA,"LOVED the food here!! It was authentic and delicious! I usually get the sampler which is worth the cost. The service was superb also. If you're looking for authentic New Orleans home away from home food, this is the place to go!",1
OD2dbQTKN7FS01fHzZqqzA,"Friday night.  Missed an event due to traffic so decided to give bourbon a try.  I lived in Nawlins for a few years and am always excited for good Cajun food.

Place looks great. Decor is wonderful, especially the gas lamps and the balconies are a nice touch (even if they won't let you stand on there).  we had several cocktails all of which were well received.  The hurricanes were pretty typical.    I went with the sampler of jambalaya red beans and gumbo.  The gumbo was outstanding.  Very authentic.  Red beans were good but jot exceptional. The jambalaya tasted like it came out of a package.   Rice was very dry and the andoulie sausage bland.  That was disappointing.  Then came coffee and beignets.  Coffee was good.  Beignets.... not so much.     It's good fare.  Certainly better than  other Cleveland options in the Cajun category.   Pricing is decent and atmosphere is good.  Unfortunately my expectations were set high by. Cleveland.com article the put their food at the same level as l'Albatross.  It's not.   Worth checking out for what it is though.",1
OD2dbQTKN7FS01fHzZqqzA,"Excellent!  The crab cake appetizer was small but delicious; loaded with crab meat.  The salmon was cooked perfectly.  Blackened and moist.  Absolutely delicious.  The shrimp and grits was truly authentic and again, absolutely delicious.  Others in our party had the burger, po'boy and sirloin.  Everyone fully enjoyed their meals.  They also have an extensive beer menu.  The service was GREAT. Will definitely visit again next time I am in Cleveland.",1

OD2dbQTKN7FS01fHzZqqzA,"Beautiful place. I have been there several times and I thought I should share how authentic and vibrant the place feels as soon as you enter. Large beautiful bar on the 1st floor with a unique assortment of craft beers on tap. Great selection of xmas ales and various hoppy IPA's. I recommend a flight as a great way to sample the various brands.  Original NOLA cocktail list that will not fail to impress. If you are a bourbon/whiskey drinker, I recommend the veux carre. The menu keeps to the establishment's authenticity. I have tried several dishes that I have found delicious. The frog legs as an appetizer is a tasty starter. I recommend the shrimp creole as well.  I also try the gumbo every time I go and I am never disappointed. 
The upstairs provides great ambiance with a beautiful railings which allow views of the 1st floor. Truly impressive place with so much personality and character to appreciate. 
Great vibe to relax have a bite or throw a few cocktails back. Highly recommend as it will become your favorite new spot.",1

recommend the shrimp rocks for app. wife had the ratatouille with chicken added and she loved it. first time i had the blackened chicken poullet, and it was great. recommend the hot sauce that is own the table if you want to spice up your entree. 
beer selection is great, recommend the brooklyn blast. cocktails use fresh juice which my wife prefers. i prefer the veux carre and sazerac. 
love the atmosphere, 2 story seating, and the authentic atmosphere. 
definitely recommend coming in for a bite or just for coctails.",1
OD2dbQTKN7FS01fHzZqqzA,"We only stopped in here for drinks at the bar but this place was beautiful! Decor inside is elegant yet still casual with plenty of seating areas. Loved the layout with the inside balcony which made it feel like authentic New Orleans. We made it to happy hour just before it ended. My boyfriend tried a mini hurricane and I had a tito's, soda, lime- both $4! Drinks were strong enough and tasty. We didn't get to try any food but the options looked delicious (they have beignets!!). Will be back here to try the food!",1
OD2dbQTKN7FS01fHzZqqzA,"This place has a very cool ambiance - when you're inside, it feels like you've stepped into a French Quarter restaurant. The gas lanterns, flour-de-lis wallpaper, tin ceilings, wrought iron railings and gas lanterns scream New Orleans charm. 

It does get busy around dinner time, but there's tons of seating - even on the large patio. However, they don't take reservations or call-ahead seating, which is pretty frustrating and eliminates it as a convenient option for planned gatherings. 

I've been for both dinner and brunch, and I have to say, brunch is my favorite of the two. All of the food I've tasted there so far is very good and authentic. As for cocktails, I'd recommend the sazerac. 

Lastly, the prices are very reasonable and they have great happy hour specials. I'll definitely be back.",1
OD2dbQTKN7FS01fHzZqqzA,"Really had high expectations for this place. I am a fan of authentic Cajun Creole New Orleans cuisine and discovering there was a restaurant nearby, I was truly excited. I must preface this review by stating that I am extremely picky with very high standards. I was grateful that they offered happy hour appetizers. This allowed me to sample the food before ordering an entre. I started with the hush puppies and gumbo. For $4 each, this special offers great value, as the portion sizes were pretty decent. I really enjoyed the puppies. The seasoning was spot on and the dipping sauce was amazing. The gumbo was average and could have used a little more seasoning in the broth. The red beans and rice were overcooked. The rice and the beans were mushy. The seasoning was ok. Also, there was much to be desired re the freshness of the food. It tasted as though they were either frozen or had been sitting for a while before being served. My daughter had the shrimp and grits which she liked. They were just ok to me; but I am not a fan of shrimp and grits. Maybe they were just off that day. It happens. However, i will probably not return. I rate this restaurant average.",0
OD2dbQTKN7FS01fHzZqqzA,"I don't even know where to begin. This place was mindblowingly delicious. 

Not only am I super sad I didn't even know this place excited until recently, but I am ELATED that I only have to drive 40 minutes for some bomb and authentic Cajun food. 

I obviously ordered the gumbo. How can you NOT come to a Cajun restaurant and order something else? It was SO GOOD. I do with corn bread was served with it over sour dough bread, but I got over that super fast because it was SO DELICIOUS! You could taste so many different depths of flavors, and the House hot sauce was great to get it to a spice level of my liking! It was so good I literally ate the entire bowl (it's huge) and had no regrets. Lol 

The drinks are also phenomenal, and you definitely get more than you pay for. The jambalaya, hush puppies, and sweet potato waffle fries were also superb. 

I can't wait to come back and eat my feelings again! It's hard to come by a restaurant that specializes, and succeeds, in true comfort food.",1
OD2dbQTKN7FS01fHzZqqzA,"I've been craving chargrilled oysters for months now, and discovered these were on the menu here. We stopped in on a Friday night around 9:30pm and were immediately seated on the 2nd floor. Great view! 
This is where the greatness stopped until dessert. 

We ordered a bowl of gumbo, raw oysters, chargrilled oysters, crawfish etouffee, and shrimp creole. All were terrible. The roux tasted pre-packaged in the soups, and the chargrilled oysters are not chargrilled! This was more like an Oysters Rockefeller, so the misleading name should be corrected. There was spinach and a ton of cheese - no luscious lemon/butter/herb sauce, no smoky flavor. Extremely disappointing. 
The only highlight was the bread pudding, which was out of this world. Sadly, the bread pudding couldn't stop this from getting a 2 star review. Won't be back until authenticity is established.",0
OD2dbQTKN7FS01fHzZqqzA,"Four of us went for lunch yesterday.  I have been wanting to get here and finally did.  Was a rainy day, but the voodoo gods of New Orleans must have liked us, it got sunny as we stepped out of our car so we were able to sit on the patio.

You know what they say about first impressions.....you literally feel like you have walked into New Orleans when you walk into the door.  Love the decor and authentic details.  Almost made me want to sit inside, but with Cleveland weather, I sit outside every chance I get.

Patio was charming as well, but not like the restaurant.  We were immediately approached and asked if we were here before.  The gumbo sounded good, but we asked server if it was spicy.  She offered to bring us each a ""shooter"" so we could decide for ourselves.  Nice touch, Shannon.

Two in the party ordered the gumbo, the other two thought it was too spicy for their tender tastebuds.  It was spicy, but oh so good.   In all, we got a shrimp po boy, crispy oysters, creole shrimp and the fleur debris po boy (chuck roast).  They were all very good, and the bistro sauce served with the oysters and shrimp po boy should be bottled and sold.

I can't finish my review without saying how great our server, Shannon was.  She engaged with us, gave us suggestions, took photos of us when asked and she made our experience that much more fun.

BSBR is a great addition to the Tremont neighborhood and wonder why it took me so long to enjoy this trendy, fun place with great eats.",1
OD2dbQTKN7FS01fHzZqqzA,"A MUST if you are anywhere near Tremont! 
I spent three years living in the greater New Orleans area and BSBR is as authentic as it gets. Shrimp and grits tasted like I was back in the French quarter and the ambiance is spot-on NOLA. This is the place to go to for dinner or drinks or both. Either way, you'll want to make a night of it. The place is too cool to want to leave.",1
OD2dbQTKN7FS01fHzZqqzA,"authentic NOLA food, including the gumbo and beignets! excellent service as well. this is the perfect antidote to a stressful week!",1
OD2dbQTKN7FS01fHzZqqzA,"My new favorite restaurant!

Everything is so cool from the decors to the drinks to the food to the service. 

The drinks are amazing. The staff told me that they have ancient secret cocktail recipes from New Orleans. 

I have spent a lot of time in New Orleans and it's hard to imagine that a restaurant that is not in New Orleans could be so authentic. 

Can't wait to come back next time I am in Cleveland.",1
OD2dbQTKN7FS01fHzZqqzA,"Maybe I'm not getting it, or maybe this place is just not for me.
I saw this place and really wanted to go. I'm originally from New Orleans and grew up on this food. My dad makes gumbo for us when we see him, and it's my baseline. I realize nothing will probably ever be as good to me, because your family's cooking elicits other emotional responses, and I realize that others have their own ideas on how things should be. But, after eating the gumbo here, I kind of think they pulled a recipe online and decided that was going to be it. It was darker than I'd ever seen it, and was more like a stew than the soupy consistency I've always had. Maybe it was an off day. Maybe they burned the roux and decided that it was close enough and no one would really notice. Maybe they didn't want to put an etoufee on the menu (because I don't think there is one) so decided to make an etoufee/gumbo hybrid with this because fewer people know what etoufee is. Or maybe they always burn the roux, and maybe they have the wrong idea on what gumbo is.
Or maybe, again, I'm just not getting it and I'm not the audience. It's the same with Chinese food: it's not that the chefs at the Chinese restaurants in the US are bad cooks or don't have good recipes, it's that they have to appeal to their market. People come in and request that sugary goop be dumped on their deep fried chicken and put over dry rice. If they served real Chinese food and still called it ""Chinese"", they probably wouldn't be around very long.
And that may be the case here. Cleveland doesn't seem to have many New Orleans-style restaurants and it's maybe appealing to those who really believe that ""Cajun style"" means pounding a piece of meat flat, burning it, and then putting a ton of seasoning on it. But I like to hope that there are those who are striving to keep their independent restaurant at a higher standard of authenticity than to that of, say, Cheesecake Factory (whose ""cajun pasta"" is an abomination).
And I can't say that I can get better New Orleans or Louisiana style food where I live. I save it for New Orleans. I've tried it in Houston, Huntsville (which was one of favs outside New Orleans), Colorado Springs, Indianapolis, Tucson, Tampa, and a bunch of other really random cities and, at least from what I've found, the farther you get from New Orleans, the worse it gets. So I think they're doing decent things here, with that in mind. And I can see the market they're trying to appeal to, but I wish the execution could have been a little better. Gumbo, the way I like it, just tastes better than theirs.
On the plus, the bread on the po boy my wife got was very close to what you actually get in much of Louisiana. Strangely, my gumbo also came with bread, but the bread was different than what was on the po boy. So they keep two different kinds of bread on hand? She liked her po boy though.
And, man, good thing, because this was expensive. Even with the Gumbo Day discount, we got the bill up there. My wife's po boy was especially highly priced. No seafood, and I believe it was like $13 or $15. Even at the really touristy places in New Orleans, at the French Market, they run around $10, and I usually get much larger ones when I go for around $8 (a little more for catfish). Not unheard of (the place in Indianapolis is just as bad on pricing), but it's always been odd to me to pay that much for a sandwich on stale bread.
But, again, maybe I'm not the audience here.
So go enjoy it, but maybe do so in the context of ""restaurant"" and not ""New Orleans-style food"".",0
OD2dbQTKN7FS01fHzZqqzA,"I have never been to NOLA, but after multiple visits to Bourbon Street Barrel Room it's on list of places to visit. Any inclination I've ever had about what authentic New Orleans cuisine tastes like is satisfied at this restaurant. The decor is beautiful, the service is always top notch, and the food is unlike anything I can get at another restaurant. 

If you like to live on the healthier side, this may be a restaurant you'll want to visit when you're feeling in the mood to treat yourself. You will not be able to resist the hush puppies, the jambalaya, the red beans and rice, or the Po' boys. 

And, did I mention their $4 happy hour!? Several appetizers and drinks are only $4 during that time period! You don't want to miss this place!",1
OD2dbQTKN7FS01fHzZqqzA,"The atmosphere along with the waitress was pleasing and delightful. The food, however, is absolutely ghastly. Bland and simply not fresh nor authentic. I would never return for cuisine but could see myself there for drinks.",0
OD2dbQTKN7FS01fHzZqqzA,"Meh. The food was not nearly as exciting as the hype. The food tasted like doctored up prepackaged freezer dinners over fresh rice. Kind of like commercial restaurants style food IMO. 
I had jambalaya, crawfish ÁE©touffÁE©e, shrimp creole, and hot rocks. I ate some of the leftovers today to let the ""asoning go through"" and it was still just okay. The food is not seasoned well IMO, but it has a spicy kick to it for an ""authentic"" appeal. It tasted like cajun (Old Bay) powder is the only seasoning used in the shrimp creole because aside from that spicy kick, it was bland. The other dishes aren't very memorable so again, meh. 
The ambiance is nice but if you like to look at your food while eating, it may be a challenge because it's dimly lit with a small light at the table which wasn't much help. The prices are fair and the service was basic. 
This is a place that if you go once, you don't have to go again unless you only use salt and pepper on your food and if that's that case, you'll love this place..o",0

oHeiAs-mnDJU1_4BD8_5Dg,"Since my last review,  I went back twice! Lol! I just can't get enough! Their margaritas are huge! The mix is pre-made, but I still taste a strong shot of what seemed like JosÁE© Cuervo.  The food was delicious and plentiful as always. I also like the fact that it is family owned, and you are served and catered by Hispanics. It makes it way more authentic. Once again the CHURROS are violently good. They make you want to slap your mama (just don't though :)) I love the Mexican Music,  and the comforting and relaxed yet colorful atmosphere. Great family oriented place for sure!",1
oHeiAs-mnDJU1_4BD8_5Dg,"I love this place. The decor, the atmosphere, the food! the service, it's all great. Cleveland has literally no Mexican restaurants and this one is my go to. I know it's not exactly authentic but it's so good. The service is always so friendly too. Plus, their prices are great!!",1
oHeiAs-mnDJU1_4BD8_5Dg,"Excited that there's a new place to eat around Shaker Square. Admittedly I had low expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised at how great the food and service was. Started with a small lime margarita, which for $4.99 was not small at all (the medium is huge - see pic). It wasn't one of those pre-made mixes, and it wasn't too sweet and adequately strong. Free chips and homemade salsa (at least it tasted homemade) were a nice addition.

I had the authentic tacos - carnitas, steak, and chorizo (one of each). In a corn tortilla as expected. The chorizo was my favorite and the steak was tender and flavorful. I would definitely order again. The pork was a little over done but still tasty. The bf had the Durango burrito which was awesome. I would pay a lot of money for a vat of the cheese sauce they put on top. 

The service was excellent - super attentive. I'm excited to come back and try more dishes.",1

Had the you- pick combo with a burrito and quesadilla, and another entree was a Chipotle chicken traditional dish. Very moderately priced. This is our go- to restaurant for Mexican food!",1
oHeiAs-mnDJU1_4BD8_5Dg,"This place has an amazing Mexican drinks and food ! I went here Saturday night in the evening! It had a full bar and also really nice atmosphere . Soon as you are seated the server greets and brings you fresh and warm chips and salsa. The server is very nice attentive and informative. I haven't had really any Mexican food, so I had alot of questions. The server explained and recommend their drinks and food. The margarita itself was very delicious. I got myself a steak fajitas and their food specials. The steak fajitas comes with rice, beans, guacamole, and sour cream. The steak fajitas comes in sizzling and warm in a skittle dish. They also give you a Mexican salad on the side. The food portions are great and the prices are great! The fajitas was so delicious and flavorful. The specials came with shrimp, steak, and chicken in this huge bowl of art! The presentation itself looked amazing but the food and the sauce was even better! That also came with rice, beans, guacamole, and sour cream. The portion was huge and incredibly delicious.

Also, while several people have told me this is a ""French"" patisserie, this is anything but. It's definitely a stereotypical americanized version of what people probably think a French patisserie looks like, and its definitely cute, it doesn't have the charm or the quality of food to be anything close to authentic.

I will say, their coffee is pretty good. So top if for your tourist shot, but there are much better places to get pastries around here.",0
oODLpNDZwO8nU4jZDWRlVA,"I went to this place to check it out since it is relatively new, and tacos are among my favorite food. Overall, it was decent. The tacos are very small, but they give you a side with it for free which helps. The quality of the taco was good, and seemed relatively authentic in flavor. However, the small portion size for the price left me a little dissatisfied. The guacamole however, I was very impressed with, both in portion size and taste. The ambiance of the restaurant was great overall, and wasn't too crowded. I'd check it out of tacos or Mexican food is your thing, but I wouldn't expect it to become your favorite.",1

oODLpNDZwO8nU4jZDWRlVA,Found this place on Yelp and was excited to try. What a disappointing and bizarre experience. Reading other Yelp reviews and the posted menus we knew that the prices were higher than the many other Mexican restaurants nearby. So we expected super exceptional authentic Mexican food. Not the case here. The shrimp tacos were fried dry and beyond overcooked. The chicken tinga tacos had zero flavor... we ordered the guacamole appetizer and they gave us a 4 oz portion - the same size that you get at Chipotle for $2 but they charged $5. We refused to pay for it and they said they normally give a larger portion but they ran out of that container size. Onto the chips - they smelled stale and tasted the same. The only thing out of our order that was good was the chorizo queso. The storefront has no sign so you'll never find it without Google maps. Take a few minutes and drive to Tapatias in Lakewood or Cozumel or Villa de Zapata or... so many more located nearby. There was only 1 couple seated and one guy at the bar so being too busy was not an option. Not sure what constitutes their prices.,0
oODLpNDZwO8nU4jZDWRlVA,"Super fresh. Best chips and guacamole around. We got street tacos, veggie tacos and fish tacos. Tried the flour and corn shells. Everything was fresh and authentic. 4 stars because the margaritas were overpriced!",1

Our server was super friendly, and nice. He made sure we always had water & drinks refilled! I ordered the nachos. Even though it isn't hard to mess up nachos, they were excellent!  They put a lot of toppings on the chips. 

Heard they have a really good happy hour selection. We plan on coming back soon.",1

oODLpNDZwO8nU4jZDWRlVA,Very cute place! Service was friendly. Margs were a good size and pretty tasty. The food was DELICIOUS! Very authentic and full of so much flavor. I think we may have ordered half the menu!! The chorizo and steak tacos were the best and I don't remember the name but there is a bacon wrapped stuffed jalapeÁE±o appetizer that is to die for. I would put the sauce on the tacos as well! Can't wait to come back and try some more things!,1
oODLpNDZwO8nU4jZDWRlVA,This is the most authentic Mexican restaurant in Cleveland. My family is from Mexico and I brought them in to test it out and they were not disappointed!

The artwork and modern atmosphere is very cultural and made me feel like I was in Mexico celebrating day of the dead.,1
oODLpNDZwO8nU4jZDWRlVA,Outstanding in every way. Fantastic tequila selection. All the best high-end tequilas and some really rare ones as well. Happy hour food was amazing.

The staff really knows what they are doing and are helpful to the people who come in and out of the store.,1
orrrhqRRUORIzUSxWTveKg,"Epic cannoli- the filling has a creme fraiche consistency, isn't overly sweet, and the texture is perfectly contrasted with the flaky pastry casing.

Cream puffs are always delicious, too.",1
orrrhqRRUORIzUSxWTveKg,"Presti's is a bakery with a lot of lunch options. They do a decent job of trying to get the crowds through, but It's still a bit hectic with the 'take a number' system. I suppose that's the authentic italian part. Both the food and pastries alright: sometimes a little bland, and sometimes very good. My favorite thing to get is the meat stromboli.",1
orrrhqRRUORIzUSxWTveKg,Loved it. Just happened to stumble upon it and thought it was fantastic. They use a number system instead of waiting in a line - I think this is great because they day I was there was super crowded and having a number meant that I could walk around and decide what I wanted before I ordered which I think made it a lot more efficient. Loved the authentic Italian ice and gelato (the peanut butter was to die for). I also have a few other goodies I took home with me that I haven't tried yet but look amazing. This is definitely a must repeat on my next trip to cleveland.,1
orrrhqRRUORIzUSxWTveKg,"Presti's Bakery is one of those places where you can go and get authentic ethnic food at reasonable prices. Italian food is available everywhere, you can find pizza in any food court all over the country but by authentic, I mean how the Italians eat in Italy. I should clarify that I have never been to Italy but I can tell when I see the real ingredients rather than canned and processed ingredients on the food. 

The other very good thing about this place is a location. It is in a very nice place on the corner, so it has more than one wall with glass windows, means more light. Very basic seating arrangement makes it elegant. In the summertime there are chairs and tables outside where you can seat and enjoy your meal. 

I ordered Pizza margarita, which is my favorite specialty pizza. I loved it. I am going to be a regular at this place.",1
orrrhqRRUORIzUSxWTveKg,"I've never had an authentic canoli before and it was yummy! My group and I had eaten at Trattoria for dinner and strolled down the streets of little Italy for something sweet. The Italian cookies were good, nothing too special, but the Gelato and the Canoli's were just what the doctor ordered! I was already stuffed from Trattoria, but I got a canoli, took 2 bites and brought it back to my hotel for after our nightly bar trip- perfect! I would highly recommend this place to daters out there as the late-night ambiance was quite beautiful, too bad the high school kids that worked there weren't a bit more friendly.",1
oSS4sjOEjsubAKdTuAErfw,"This place is strange. I used to really love it - I would always get something tasty and satisfying. Great comfort food. One day I got into an argument with a co-worker. He said the Mad Greek was good sometimes and bad sometimes, tasteless food and such. I defended the Mad Greek to him, saying I went there all the time and it was always good!

So this argument left me craving some Mad Greek, and I went back a few days later. Terrible. Salty Indian food with no flavor. I was stunned. Since then I have experienced the same a few times.

I would definitely give this place a 4 or 5 star rating for my usual experience. It's not the most authentic, but it's delicious and different, and they have Indian and Greek food for an interesting combination. But occasionally, it's terrible and ruins your dinner. So I guess 3 stars.",0
oTTBpDELlpgMah1o0OIbvA,"This place may not be fancy but the food is 5 star that's for sure!

oWHZtv98YyKvSennjtBuAA,"Pour is a beautiful, hip and local business right at the heart of East 4th street off of Euclid Avenue. I am becoming a coffee slash tea lover and this is the place to stop in at as a beginner or an expert drinker. The staff is so helpful explaining all of the coffee slash tea terminology, so I and you, are able to make a decision within a reasonable time.

Love the authenticity of this fabulous place where all can enjoy. I come here to to catch up with friends and not to study because it can be rather loud at times. It is nice to enjoy the liveliness of Euclid Avenue during the day too. You can't ask for a classier, quaint, yet authentic coffee shop like pour in downtown Cleveland.

Don't be afraid to ask questions on their drink menu, they are experts and wiling to explain any and all questions you may have. Cheers to pour!",1
oxeW1tSB-e_oIzCQZtqyTw,"Visited the first time towards the end of December 2012.  What can I say....

First, I don't hate this place.  Nice hip interior and friendly servers.  Based upon the reviews here and pictures posted, I tried 2 different kinds of buns and Takahachi ramen.

I would give them a credit for buns.  One of them was tonkatsu, which was not notably impressive but the other one, butcher's bun, was exceptionally good, at least to me.  Very good idea and tasty topping.  It will be worth trying definitely.  

Sadly, Takahachi ramen was just awful.  I completely agree with Michael W. from CA review.  Although the ramen bowl looks great, the broth was completely tasteless.  I am a native Japanese who knows about ramen noodle very well, probably more than anyone else in the neighborhood.  This was a total degrading and disrespecting the name of ramen.  I am sorry to say but if someone highly talks about this Takahachi ramen, I will need to question his/her sense of taste.  The word Takahachi alone does not make a lot sense.  It could be Takahashi or something else.  I was totally disgusted by this ramen.  I even had to ask the server if this was how it's been made and I was told 'yes'.... Really.  

There are other noodle dishes on the menu and I really should not make a harsh judgement against Takahachi ramen but if it is truly how they make and serve, then it has to be corrected.  I am not sure whether or not Noodlecat tries to reproduce the real Japanese style ramen noodle.  If they seriously are proud of what they call ramen, they at least need to visit Ippudo in NYC. Shinano of Solon OH is an authentic Japanese restaurant and their ramen is far better than Takahachi ramen.  Shinano does not specialize in ramen but their soup is tasty and flavorful.",0
oxeW1tSB-e_oIzCQZtqyTw,"When Noodlecat opened, I was very excited that Cleveland was getting its first ramen restaurant. The Japanese restaurants around here primarily center around either sushi or hibachi. When their menus do have ramen on them, it is usually the frozen prepackaged type. There are plenty of Vietnamese restaurants serving pho close to downtown, but ramen is a completely different animal. 

Having read the other reviews, my expectations were tempered. I didn't expect it to be the authentic hakata or sapporo style ramen that I had when I was in Las Vegas that cost $7 for a large bowl and inspired me to spend 2 months developing a recipe to satisfy my new obsession.

Here's a synopsis of what we had:

Takahachi Raman - If it wasn't for the garlic, this wouldn't have much of any taste. The shredded pork becomes a tangled mush in the soup.

Fried Chicken and Ramen - I didn't get any sense of fried chicken in the soup. Maple syrup and hot sauce on fried chicken is always a good combination, but the breading and the chicken itself was not seasoned. The leg piece is a a bad accompaniment with a dish that you eat with chopsticks and a spoon.

Ohio Beef Brisket and Matzo Ramen - This one was the most disappointing. The beef was good, but the broth had almost no taste. The matzo ball was flavorless, extremely dense, surprisingly cold and I had to spit it out. When I got home that night, I made my own matzo ball soup from scratch in the hopes of forgetting this travesty.

Pork Miso Ramen - They've revised their menu so this is no longer served in the downtown location. It was the only soup that had a strong flavor, but of soy sauce instead of miso. It's dark and thin which tells you that this is really lacking in miso.

Spicy Octopus Stir Fry Udon - It's reminiscent of the noodles that you might get at a Mongolian Barbeque restaurant. Lots of spice, but lacking in complexity.

Tempura Walleye Steam Bun - The small piece of fish had a thin soggy batter. The bun itself is the frozen Chinese type that cost a couple bucks for a package.

Overall, it is pricey even during happy hour and what you get is just passable. I'm still glad that there's more variety now in downtown rather than just another sandwich shop. There are several good ideas that need work and I hope that they hire a consultant to help with the recipes. The owner is friendly and the staff did a good job. I think this place could be a part of the food revolution happening here if it can adapt quickly to be more than just a niche place for hipsters.",0
oxeW1tSB-e_oIzCQZtqyTw,"If you're eating noodles, you're not just ordering for the noodles itself but for the flavor of the broth and the toppings. I ordered the fried chicken ramen and the broth was very bland. Even though the fried chicken was tasty, it could not compensate for the lack of toppings. If you are looking for authentic Japanese ramen, do not come to this place expecting anything. 

The happy hour deal (2 steam buns for $5) was a delight and would come back for the buns but only for that reason.",0
oxeW1tSB-e_oIzCQZtqyTw,Funny how a cat is the logo for this restaurant as it is more likely to attract cats than people. The ramen noodles aren't authentic and the the pork broth has shredded pork Inside that tasted more like mystery meat that's heavy and gives the broth an unappealing thickness and texture. It was really hard to get down. Here kitty kitty!,0
oxeW1tSB-e_oIzCQZtqyTw,Noodlecat has gone way downhill. It is sad. What used to be a great authentic ramen experience with great alternatives like the best chirashi in town has turned into a shadow of its former self.,0
oxeW1tSB-e_oIzCQZtqyTw,"Seriously does everything have to always be judged on how 'authentic' it is? Is it good or isn't it? Did you have good service or didn't you? Noodlecat is not pretending to be authentic Japanese cuisine. If you don't like the food, by all means leave a low rating, but not solely on 'authenticity'. I don't really get some of the pretty negative reviews overall. Oh well, when the haters stay away, there'll be more room for me!

Noodlecat is a very good, cheap place to grab a bite to eat downtown. Lunch is fast (they promise takeout in 15 minutes), but even sitting down it only took 30 min for us to be in and out. 

The steam buns are great and at 2/$6 are a good value for a medium-sized snack. Half portions of the noodle bowl entrees are also only $6 and they are PLENTY big for me. I don't think I could eat all of the full $11 bowl even if I was pretty hungry. A half portion and two steam buns was plenty for all in our group to leave just right, not stuffed. 

I highly recommend the Japanese fried chicken steam bun. Bomber. And with the even cheaper happy hour prices which are served all day on Sunday as well as happy hour during the week, really, what's not to like?

No, it isn't extremely authentic ramen but then again, it isn't trying to be. Cheap and yummy. Give it a shot.",1
oxeW1tSB-e_oIzCQZtqyTw,"I've been to other ramen places in California, very authentic and delicious. So I wasn't sure what to expect out of a more hippie ramen place, such a noodlecat.
I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The noodles were delicious and full of flavor.
I had the misu pork, which I'm told is the most popular choice. It was great! Very rich, I barely even finished half the bowl. So unless you're starving, you'll probably end up taking half of it home (which isn't a bad deal at all!).
My husband had the spicy octopus, which isn't soupy, it's more like a stirfry bowl, and he said it was also delicious.
I wasn't overly impressed with the steam buns, but probably that's cause the ramen was just too delicious to be impressed with anything else at that time.
Highly recommended!",1
oxeW1tSB-e_oIzCQZtqyTw,"Was very disappointed. I know this this chef sawyers concept, and was crowdfunded to open in Cleveland. I always heard about this place, and finally got a chance to go here with some friends. Let's just say I will not be going back. I ordered the Pork Miso Ramen, and there was 0% taste of Miso. The pork tasted like Canned Army brand pork you pick up at international food stores. The broth was fatty and mucky. The pork belly bun was good, but very expensive for the price. If you want a good noodle experience go to Payne Ave and try the local Asian good places( there are a lot) of authentic places that are friendly.  This is a great location for a business and I wish someone who cared about the menu and gave authentic great tasting food would take over this place.",0
oxeW1tSB-e_oIzCQZtqyTw,"Was there at 1030pm for supper.  I felt as if either I was invisible or waiters was already in going-home mood (they close at 11pm), and I was not entertained.  So I decided to get take out that time. The ramen is not authentic and lack of taste other than saltiness.  Went back again for lunch this time to give them another chance the next day.  This time I ordered dan dan ramen and kimchi salad, finish with a friend chicken bun.  The noodle was tasty but quite plain with peanuts, garnish, and dry sauce.  Salad was really good I have to say.  The bun was average, again lack of taste but quite salty.  Overall, if you are looking for cheap food and quick lunch/supper, this place is adequate, but don't expect authentic food or great service.",0
oxeW1tSB-e_oIzCQZtqyTw,"Noodlecat is, in my opinion, a solid restaurant, and one that deserves four stars. To start with, I'm a big fan of anything that makes downtown Cleveland feel contemporary and lived-in, and this does that, so I'm predisposed to like it. When the people at Noodlecat provide that, plus quick service and cool design, not to mention tasty food, it deserves four stars - and five down the road, if I continue to have good experiences there. 

At between $10-20/meal, I won't be coming here every night on my student budget, but for the quality of the food I got, I didn't begrudge them the prices, nor did I feel like I got a small portion for my money. After a bowl of noodles and a bun, I was full - and I'm a 6'4"" guy with a love for eating that at times may border on the fanatical. My portion of Hokkaido noodles were delicious and well-seasoned, and unlike other reviewers previously, I found that it wasn't overly salty. The BBQ Pulled Pork steam bun was delicious, and more than anything I was sad that I'd only ordered one.

Full disclosure: I'm not a ramen connoisseur. I don't generally hunt down ramen places in other cities to compare them to Noodlecat, and I haven't been to Japan to taste 'the real deal'. I didn't come here looking for 'authentic ramen just like the REAL Japanese make it'. However, I'm proud to say that I've been eating food practically my whole life, and speaking as an objective party I'll tell you that the food served here is delicious. I'll be coming back, and if you're thinking of going to Noodlecat but were given pause by its three star average on Yelp, let me advise you:
Go. Take a crazy leap of faith, and go decide for yourself whether you like it. At worst you'll get a meal that you aren't wild about, but at best you'll find your new favourite food spot downtown, which just happens to provide food found nowhere else in Cleveland and is damn tasty to boot.",1
oxeW1tSB-e_oIzCQZtqyTw,"Went here for lunch on a busy Saturday and the food was very good.  I really don't get the bad reviews for this place.  Is it the most authentic ramen place?  No, but it is damn good.  The steamed buns and gyozas are great starters and the noodles are great!  They have a decent beer list too. One thing that I don't like is their tofu.  It has a weird texture, most likely due to it being poached.  Other than that, the food is very good.",1
oxeW1tSB-e_oIzCQZtqyTw,"Had the pork-miso ramen and the pulled pork buns. Ramen texture was similar to Maruchan instant ramen and soba noodles. Char-Siu did not taste authentic nor did the soup base (tasted just like miso and shoyu). Pulled pork bun was also drenched in BBQ sauce and overtly sweet. Overall, this is not authentic Japanese ramen restaurant...What brings this restaurant down further is that I was seated and IGNORED for 10 minutes (i actually kept looking at my watch) before a waiter asked if anyone has taken my order. I sat and watched while another waiter (female) was busy fawning over other customers and then had the audacity to stand around at the register right next to where I was seated by myself (while these customers were deciding on their order). Piss poor customer service along with lackluster food.",0
oxeW1tSB-e_oIzCQZtqyTw,"My go-to spot for ramen in NE Ohio. Granted, other restaurants in NE Ohio don't seem to know what kind of noodles ramen is comprised of, but that's neither here nor there. For all the people giving Noodlecat one star because it isn't ""what they had in California/Japan""... get up outta' here with that ish. It's not authentic, but it's not supposed to be.

Positives:
- Cute location & good music
- Wonderful, chewy, curly noodles and tasty broth
- Consistently fluffy steam buns
- Perfect 6 minute egg

Needs improvement:
- The menu overhaul they did about a year ago was mostly negative (except for reducing the portion size, and thus, price). They took away their two best steam buns (brisket and pulled pork) and 98% of their beer options.
- They seem to be out of the few items the menu does have pretty often. Last time we were there, a couple next to us ordered 3 items in a row the restaurant was out of. I was embarrassed for them. My husband ordered a Sopporo (one of the three beers on the menu), and they were out at 6 P.M. on a Saturday. They also were out of the ginger beer I ordered.

In summation, I'll continue to frequent this place, but I really wish they'd bring some of their best items back to the menu and stock the ones they claim to have.",0
oxeW1tSB-e_oIzCQZtqyTw,"after a little yelp hiatus, Im back to write my first review since relocating to cleveland.  i usually dont like reviewing places unless i have some positive things to say, but i feel somewhat compelled to write about this place.  being that i am fourth generation japanese, born in seattle, and basically grew up eating ramen on the west coast  (LA's little tokyo, SF's Japantown, and Chinatown in Seattle), i was super stoked to find out about ""Noodlecat"" and could not wait to try it.  after visiting the noodlecat website, and watching the creative story behind the restaurant, i was sure that jonathan sawyer was going to serve up a slam dunk...  boy was i wrong.

my wife and i went on a wednesday night.  though the atmosphere was nothing to write home about, it didnt matter to us.  we were there for the food.  we posted up at one of their high top communal tables in the bar area and got straight to work.  we started off with stone ipa and northpeak wanderer.  the beer selection was mediocre, a couple interesting brews that may pair well with some of the dishes, but there were only 2 beers on tap (both of which the waitress ""couldnt remember"").  the cocktails and wine/sake list seemed decent, but honestly we didnt really spend too much time in that section.

on to the appetizers.  for us, this was the highlight of the meal by far.  honestly, i wish we would have just stopped there.  we tried the wings, which we were told, were the same duckfat chicken wings that are served at sawyers ""other"" restaurant.  i really enjoyed the miso garlic flavor, although the miso was pretty subtle, and the wings were cooked perfectly.  we also had an order of the twice cooked shisito peppers, which were delicious.  they had a nice char to them, with just a hint of spice, and plenty of salt.  a great pairing with our ipa's, and a definite ""must try"".

ok, onto the main event, the noodles.  and this is honestly, where i get a bit confused.  without hesitation, i ordered the pork miso ramen haru baru style, as i love miso ramen.  my wife settled on the kyoto udon.  the noodles were presented in a odd shaped bowl that was very shallow, definitely not your typical noodle soup bowl.  but thats ok, as long as it tastes good right?  well, i immediately noticed that the ratio of stock to noodles was way off (not enough stock), and the presentation  was pretty sloppy.  anyone who has been to a ramen house knows that japanese people like to have things ""in their place"", and the components of a ramen dish are no exception.  mine looked like pulled pork and nori had just been carelessly ""thrown in"".  it did not look appetizing at all.  though mine was nice and hot, id call my wifes luke-warm at best.  but we were too hungry to send it back.

flavor profile was pretty one dimensional as well.  mine tasted heavily of pork with not even a hint of miso.  the broth was fatty, which im usually a fan of, but it just didnt work this time.  my wifes, the same.  the udon broth tasted like canned mushroom soup, and the ""pickled"" tofu didnt not complement the dish at all.  her noodles were cooked properly.  mine were not.  totally overcooked.  in fact, they were so overcooked im not sure if they were even authentic ramen noodles.  they seemed like the generic egg noodles that you can find in the asian section of giant eagle.  or do i dare say it???  like the noodles from a package of top ramen....  

anyways, enough is enough.  after seeing their video, and reading the menu, its clear that noodlecat is trying to blend the traditional tokyo style ramen house, and modern american eatery.  sounds interesting right?  well, after trying it, i feel mislead and disappointed.  needless to say, we are not in a hurry to get back.",0
oxeW1tSB-e_oIzCQZtqyTw,"It's nothing like authentic Japanese Ramen.. because it is fusion, yet still good. Tried the fried chicken and Pork Miso ramen.  Service was good yet alright. Enjoying some again~ :) Like a little bit of Tokyo in Ohio.",1
oxeW1tSB-e_oIzCQZtqyTw,"I expected too much, but after reading the menu, I already knew it was going to be a bad experience. 
Once you start seeing the words, butabara, tonkatsu, and miso, you'll know you're going to be in for a treat. 
I guess the almost 4 star rating threw me off. 
Service was very slow. 
Udon was barely warm. The 6 minute egg however, was actually cold. 
My wife's ramen wasn't very good either. Clumpy noodles. 
Both soups lacked flavor and heat, you're traditionally supposed to slurp the stuff...

It's definitely not authentic ramen.",0
oxeW1tSB-e_oIzCQZtqyTw,"I really wanted to like this place, but I really can't see myself going a second time. I had the Tsukemen Ramen and while the actual noodle was good, I can't get past the rest of it. The soup base was too ""fatty"" and didn't have that nice balance of being flavorful, but still light. And what's up with the pork belly? I went to Dante for their noodle night and pork belly was in the ramen, too. Is it some type of ""Americanized"" attempt at the less fatty type of CharShu that's usually in ramen? I don't get it and I really wish they would give you a less fatty choice of meat.

Also, the PRICE! Ramen shops in bigger cities like New York and Toronto have lower prices and don't make you pay extra on standard items, like the egg.

I just want to add that we went for lunch on opening day and were treated to the takoyaki. It was a pretty interesting take on it with the bone marrow, but like some of the reviewers said before, there were not enough octopus pieces in it. Also, service was fast and pretty good. I just really wish the food was better/more authentic.",0
oxeW1tSB-e_oIzCQZtqyTw,"Dropped in here before a baseball game after meaning to visit for so long and was glad I did! Many of my friends don't like Noodlecat, but I think that's because they wanted authentic food. 

As everyone else said, if you want authentic, go elsewhere. 

Service was fast (although they did forget my beer) despite the restaurant being quite full. My friend and I split the green curry sausage dumpling and the fried chicken dumpling appetizers. Fried chicken was fun, but green curry was definitely tastier. I just wish they had had more filling--there was too much dough. Luckily, they strange fold over shape makes it easy to tear off the extra dough and dip it in your entrÁE©e or douse in sriracha! 

I had the hokkaido ramen as an entrÁE©e and it was delicious. The corn broth was creamy, but not overwhelmingly so and the cream didn't taste fatty, which would have ruined the noodles and the pork. Tasty and filling. I got the half and was stuff",1
oxeW1tSB-e_oIzCQZtqyTw,"Absolutely worth a try if you're looking for a decent meal near Public Square.  As a downtowner I've eaten here four or five times and have never left disappointed. I dunno if it's really worth 5 stars over 4, but I feel so bad about all this negativity so I figured I'd bump it up a notch.

Firstly, I can't believe that people call the portions small. I'm a decent eater and I generally can barely finish a steam bun and a bowl. 

Secondly, I've had (or at least tried with a friend) most of the stuff on the menu at Noodlecat. Don't walk in expecting true authenticity from a place that serves a dish called ""Roscoe's Fried Chicken and Ramen."" It's just not gonna happen. What you should expect is awesome service and good ""fusion"" dishes that are maybe a little expensive for a lunch but not overpriced on the whole. The flavors are strong, but the noodles are mild and almost all the bowls come with some sort of veggies in them to help offset the saltiness of the rest of the dish. You can also have them crack an egg in it or get some avocado to even it out if you're so inclined.

Thirdly, if you're gonna make a fuss about the chef (who has taken the time to come to your table and talk to you) being in jeans and a bandanna, you may as well cross off two thirds of the decent restaurants in the city.

Fourthly, Fever tree Ginger beer might be the greatest beverage in the western hemisphere.

Anyway, Noodlecat is an awesome restaurant. Order the specials, they're always amazing.",1
oxeW1tSB-e_oIzCQZtqyTw,"It's hard to judge a place like this that lacks the authenticity of a traditional ramen house, yet intentionally tries to push the creative boundaries and support local products.  My local Japanese restaurant has fantastic ramen and broth, so Noodlecat was a bit of a step down, at least for the shio college ramen and the pork miso ramen.  The BBQ pork and the brisket steam buns were delicious.

I'm glad this place exists, and I think I would have enjoyed it more if I didn't expect authenticity.",0
oxeW1tSB-e_oIzCQZtqyTw,"THE SKINNY: Noodlecat is Cleveland's fledgling, whimsical gastropub interpretation of Japanese-style ramen and miscellaneous Asian-fusion apps.  NOTE: emphasis on the Cleveland interpretation.  Flavor combos, while guaranteed to intrigue, are hit or miss--take that whichever way you will, but I'm inclined to be positive and say I'm excited and hopeful to witness Noodlecat's evolution.

PROS: Novelty (first Cleveland-ramen fusion joint ever woot); super friendly, down-to-earth staff; decent beer selection (Hitachino love!); killer wings and fried chicken (provided in the Roscoe's ramen, nomnom!); incorporation of local produce and items from local businesses (ahem OHC Pasta!); chic, sleek modern decor; reasonable Happy Hour deals; probably the only place in CLE where you can enjoy Cartoon Network while you slurp noodles (Adventure Time at dinner!  Hollaaa!)

CONS: Overpriced for the not-so-Happy Hours; flavor combos are novel but clearly in the works; noodles and noodle broths tend to lack complexity and umami; soy-braised egg's too salty.

THE PART YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT: THE GREAT CLE NOODLE CONTROVERSY OF 2011-12
The above said, I feel the need to address the rift and sadly, vitriol expressed by both sides of the ""OMG Noodlecat is an effing FAKE! v. SHUTUP you ELITIST hipster ASIANS and ASIANPHILES how dare you have a reason to lord it over people who haven't had ""authentic"" ramen!"" controversy.

Really you guys, c'mon. Let's graduate from the 3rd grade namecalling and throw a nice, old-fashioned blind-drunk pub brawl.  Like civilized adults.  Settle this once and for all.  

I. ""OMG Noodlecat is an effing FAKE"":
As someone who's had ""authentic"" Japanese-style ramens (yeah, there's like, 13+ different regional styles of ramen in Japan you guys) in Los Angeles and as someone who's grown up on cuisines that practically consider noodle soup a food group (like hamburgers are to American cuisine), yeah, if I judge Noodlecat by those standards, it's a serious letdown.  Tremont Taphouse's ramen is an inch closer to the ""real deal"".  But let's be honest: it's not fair to apply those standards to Noodlecat.  Like going to one of those (godawful) Chinese buffets and rating them on the authenticity of their pizza.  Or trying to rate Chipotle or Taco Bell's menu on ""authentic"" Mexican food standards.  

In defense of the ramen ""elitist"" camp--initially, when Noodlecat opened, emphasis WAS put on the incorporation of ""authentic"" straight-from-Japan ramen styles.  (Which it emphatically is not.) (Hey remember that cutesy promotional/introductory video on Noodlecat's website when they first opened?  Did you catch that one of the ""Sawyer in Japan"" scenes was filmed at local Cantonese noodle joint, Wonton BBQ and Gourmet?  Funny ish, right?) 
Expectations ran high and the noodle soup/ramen-savvy crowd cried false advertising.  Dashed to a million pieces were the hopes of the ramen-craving masses.  Understandably.  You promise me home-made ice cream and give me canned spinach instead, you betcha I'm going to be pissed.  

I'm guessing the gaff stemmed from either a marketing oversight or Sawyer miscalculated the recent influx of students/professionals who've settled in Cleveland from other cities with a bigger Asian food scene.  But since they've opened, Noodlecat's shifted its emphasis to the CLE interpretation aspect of their menu, so ramen-elitists, consider yourself forewarned.  This ain't Daikokuya or Shinsengumi, nor does it want to be.  If you want ""real"" noodle soup, walk 20 seconds around the corner for some pho at Saigon on East 4th and stop crying.

II. ""SHUT UP you stupid elitist ASIANS + ASIANPHILES"":
As someone who's never been shy to try new cuisines and who's grown to love Cleveland's distinct food scene (how can anyone with tastebuds not??), I understand the other camp's defensive outrage.  Jonathan Sawyer is one of CLE's darling homeboys and I appreciate his willingness to blend and try to create something new.  It's an organic, local, and native endeavor.  Supporting Noodlecat literally supports Cleveland business and other specific Cleveland businesses.  How cool is that?  Pretty effing cool, that's what.

However, the fact of the matter is, Sawyer's trying something pretty ambitious, where very few people have succeeded before: that Frankenstein of noms, Asian fusion.  Another CLE Asian fusion joint, Bac in Tremont is outstanding but most of the fusion is inter-Asian (Vietnamese and Thai, Vietnamese and Chinese, etc.). It's when you try to blend vastly different Western/European cuisines with Far East ones, things can get a little rough.  And it unfortunately shows in Noodlecat's noodle soup dishes.  Many of the flavor combos don't quite work/may be a little too jarring.  The broths tend to be bland and/or one-dimensional and the noodles lack texture.

Final verdict: Noodlecat's menu has definite potential but currently lacks oomph.  And I'm hopeful that oomph is arriving sometime soon.",0
oxeW1tSB-e_oIzCQZtqyTw,"I've tried Japanese ramen in four other big cities (LA, NY, DC, Chicago) so my tastes are quite spoiled when it comes to Japanese ramen. I tried their pork miso ramen and it was just ok. The broth was really salty and tasted fatty. It did have a good richness to it. Just not authentic. The noodles were good. The pork was too mushy. I found 3 small pieces of bone when I bit into the pork. Luckily my waiter was nice enough to take it off my check. I tried their japanese fried chicken bun which was not all that great. The fried chicken was really small and the sauce just didn't do it. I had to add extra hot sauce to it. My boyfriend tried the pulled pork bun and it was alright. It had too much BBQ sauce on it. Also we found a big piece of bone in it. He tried the crispy beef short rib ramen and he did not like it. The broth lacked a lot of flavor. The short ribs were alright. It seems like they tried to mimic korean short ribs. The flavor was good but the meat was sliced so thin. I would go again but only because sometimes I just need my japanese ramen fix. For now noodle cat will do.",0
oxeW1tSB-e_oIzCQZtqyTw,"Good environment and very friendly staffs. However, their food is just bad. I didn't expect they have some super authentic Japanese ramen but this is worst than those awful American Chinese restaurant.

I do recommend having a drink here, at least they didn't homebrew their Sake.",0
oxeW1tSB-e_oIzCQZtqyTw,"I was stoked about the arrival of Noodlecat after the much anticipated opening, however never made it.  It was a few months later, and everyone on Yelp! had nothing but bad things to say about it.  

I headed down on a weekday around noon for lunch, which I was scared about it being packed.  Well, we were the first table to sit in their front dining area.  It was a bit awkward, but then it started filling in a little bit.  Nothing like I would have expected for a location downtown and a fairly new eatery with a very reputable Chef.  I feel that after Greenhouse opened and with all of the praise Jon Sawyer got for that, a lot was expected of him here; rightfully so.  However, this seems to me like his quirky side gig where he just wanted to add something new to our city, but with his spin on it.  He didn't want it to be authentically Japanese or just like your favorite NYC Noodlehouse.  

We shared two different, and equally amazing buns as our app.  In fact, they were out of the one we ordered so they threw a different one at us complimentarily.   We ended up with the BBQ Ohio Pork w/ pickled onions & scallions and the
Japanese Fried Chicken. They each had unique combinations of flavors and awesome sauces, and I would definitely recommend the BBQ Pork.  

For our meals, we split the ramen of the day (A breakfast Ramen of some sort, which I cannot remember the ingredients exactly, but consisted of  aside from having a beef broth, beef sausage, potatoes and a fried egg on top) and the Takahashi Ramen.  Both were very interesting.  We both agreed that we like the components (esp. sausage) of the Breakfast ramen, but preferred the Takahashi Ramen garlic pork broth.  I wish I could have done a sampler of 5 small bowls of Ramen.  That would be ideal for me in this type of crazy ramen joint.  

We didn't have room for the Chocolate Peanut Butter Banana Steam Bun, but hell yea, I'll go back and get it.  

You should try it, too.",1
oxeW1tSB-e_oIzCQZtqyTw,"We ordered one of everything off of the menu at Noodle Cat.
There wasn't one thing I ate that night that was actually cooked properly.
It was all terrible.
I won't waste my time going into detail about the food because the owner/""chef"" clearly doesn't care.
If you're interested in ramen but have never experienced it please don't eat here and ruin it for yourself.
If you have eaten authentic Japanese comfort food in the past you will be angered and you will be insulted.
Cleveland deserves better.",0
oxeW1tSB-e_oIzCQZtqyTw,"If you're looking for ""authentic"" Asian food, you can't quite find it here. However, I don't think anywhere in Cleveland has as great Asian fusion food as Noodlecat! 

All of the dishes I've tried from them have had such rich flavors. They definitely leave me wanting for more :) One of my fave dishes from this place has got to be their pork belly buns! They are so delicious, and so cheap if you come during their happy hours (Sundays and weekday afternoons 4-6pm?)!! I also love their short rib ramen. The portion is humongous!! It was pretty much two dishes in one because I got a bowl of ramen noodles along with a side plate of Korean short ribs. YUMMY!!

 My boyfriend is a huge fan of their kimchi salad, which I love as well! They put some crunchy onion things (not exactly sure what they are lol) in there, adding so much texture in a normally plain dish. 

Servers are also very attentive, and they really try their best to explain to you the origin of each dish :)

 Definitely 5 stars!",1
oxeW1tSB-e_oIzCQZtqyTw,"I've been trying Noodlecat off and on for years, because it was the most convenient ramen option downtown. Last visit was a few weeks ago and I can tell you, it was mostly definitely my last attempt. 

They've gone downhill and it's too obvious. My noodles weren't fresh, they were most definitely the last of a pot that had been sitting there, there were huge clumps of hard stuck together noodles in my bowl, so many that it was difficult to even slurp! 

The broth is getting weaker and weaker (pork broth). It's on par with what you would get in a Blue Apron ramen, not an authentic ramen shop. Overall the bowl was bland and left-over tasting. 

The saving grace used to be the buns, and it still is (the fried chicken one is amazing), but the portion sizes of the actual meat is definitely smaller than it used to be as well. 

Sorry Noodlecat, I wanted to love you but I can't any longer.",0
oxeW1tSB-e_oIzCQZtqyTw,"Noodlecat. 

Meeeee-ow! 

I'm not going to say I hated it. I'm not going to say I loved it. I'm just going to say it was alright. 

We'll start with the ambiance -- to the person that said ""it makes Chipotle look trendy.""  --  are you insane?! This place had great ambiance! Perhaps it was a *tiny bit* too dark in the back room near the bar. But otherwise? It looks like what I think a noodle joint is supposed to look like with a nice little modern/trendy twist. We didn't quite experience the communal seating because, I'll be honest,  the place was totally dead last Friday night. 

On to the food -- I'm not a ramen snob. I've never even HAD true Japanese ramen and I'm not going to pretend to have actually had it just to make my review sound better and give me more hipster foodie street cred. However, I did go to Noodlecat with a girl who lives in NYC and has had great ramen there. (She was not very impressed with Noodlecat.)  But... I'm not so sure Chef Sawyer is really TRYING to replicate authentic Japanese ramen here so we'll just let that slide.

We started with 4 different appetizers: 2 flavors of chicken wings which were delicious (spicy stood out), octopus and bone marrow takoyaki and the sweet bread sweet breads. The last two were basically the same as they were both spherical pancakes. They just tasted like pancakes I make at home with a speck of fish flakes sprinkled on top. 

Moving on to the ramen -- I have to say I was a bit disappointed to learn that they took the Tsukemen ramen off of the menu because.... (dun dun dun dun) Clevelanders weren't eating it properly and then coming to Yelp to write bad reviews. (LOLZ!!!!)  That sauce they served on the side? It's for DIPPING... not dumping into your bowl. So, I settled for the Hokkaido ramen. It was very flavorful and hearty. Noodles were great. I enjoyed this dish but it was almost too much. The broth was a bit too fatty and very rich. I tasted 4 different noodle dishes and they all seemed to be this way. Maybe that's how ramen is supposed to be? I dunno. 

The service -- it was pretty stellar except that we really could have done without our server beating every explanation to death. It was almost like she wanted us to see how knowledgeable she was about ramen or that she had to impress us. Don't get me wrong...she was super sweet and did a great job overall. She was just TOO thorough or something. I hate to complain about that because it sounds absurd but it was really just TOO FREAKIN' thorough and she prattled on forever about traditions, the meanings of dishes, etc. We didn't really need to hear all of that. We just wanted to get our grub on. My cousin almost told her to shut up at one point.  
 
Overall, I'd say that Noodlecat is possibly a bit too ambitious of a venture for Cleveland's first ramen joint. It was good and all but I honestly cannot say I'd be dying to get back asap.",0
oxeW1tSB-e_oIzCQZtqyTw,"I was excited to give Noodlecat a try as Greenhouse Tavern is one of my favorite restaurants.  In the end, i was kinda disappointed with it. I'll start with the interior which while trying to be industrial chic, it makes Chipotle look trendy. The stools are uncomfortable so you probably won't wanna hang around and linger here for long.  Note to self- Remember to bring a donut seat cushion next time.

Next we get to the drinks. There is no Coke or Pepsi here, just Fever Tree and Grown Up Soda plus teas, beer, sake, etc. My friend ordered a Coke without being told that Coke isn't available.  He ended up with a GUS Cola which tastes like a flat Coca-Cola. I do like some of the GUS drinks as I've had them before but the Cola isn't very good and the waitress should've mentioned that this was available instead of Coke. Even worse is the exorbitant prices for GUS. $4 for a small bottle is a little crazy as it's around $1.50 to $2 at your local grocery store. The Fever Tree drinks were interesting.  The waitress mixed up our drinks and the Ginger Ale and Ginger Beer went to the wrong people at the table.  The beer was the strongest I've ever tasted but it wasn't a bad thing and i'd probably try it again although I actually ordered the ale.

Now to the food and I have to say that Noodlecat's take on Matzo ball soup was terrific.  There's nothing noodle house or Jewish deli authentic about it but it was awesome. I thought the portion was a good size and three out of four diners at our table took home leftovers (or maybe we just wanted to get off those stools!) While I didn't taste any of my friends or my wife's meals, they didn't seem to enjoy it as much as mine.  Next time I think I'll try an appetizer and a salad and see how they do in those departments.  The Matzo dish was really the saving grace about Noodlecat as I don't think I'd be so generous in my rating if it wasn't for how tasty that dish was.

My biggest issue, besides the chairs, were the prices. Most noodle houses are relatively affordable but charging $15 for a take on Matzo ball soup is out of line even if it is good. Almost all of the noodle dishes start at over $10 for dinner which is way too much. Instead of being a neighborhood noodle bar, which is what it was supposedly envisioned to be, this is almost a special occasion restaurant because of the high prices. If you want an actual neighborhood noodle house, go down to Teahouse Noodles where you can actually get a meal for under $10.  For how much the Sawyers are charging you to slurp noodles, you can practically go down the street to their GHT and have a better meal in a better atmosphere. And the best part of that is you don't have to sit on those darn stools!",0
oxeW1tSB-e_oIzCQZtqyTw,"Tried to give this place a shot while visiting Cleveland despite some of the mediocre reviews, and ended up completely regretting the decision. The dish that got me interested in trying out the place was the dan dan ramen, which ended up being a huge disappointment.

NOTE: None of these dishes -- despite their names -- are the equivalents of the Japanese dishes they are named after. They are this restaurant's take on them, which is a bit confusing for those that may be seeking the real deal, which I kind of was.

I ordered the okonomiyaki appetizer ($6), a tomato steamed bun ($3) and a dan dan ramen ($11 full size). All of the dishes came out at the same time first off, and I was hoping to at least get the okonomyaki or bun first but I guess the server didn't feel like asking what my preference was.

The okonomiyaki was some bastardized variation of this dish. Instead of a pancake, it was a crepe with some carrots and other vegetables inside. I was a bit taken aback by it, as I expected something more along the lines of... well, a pancake.

The steamed bun was not really a bun as much as a folded over dough with a tomato inside. Nothing memorable about it, and quite small compared to a regular filled bao.

The worst offender was the dish I was most looking forward to; the dan dan ramen. See, the menu doesn't really make it that clear that some of the dishes listed under the 'noodles' portion of the menu are just that, noodles. No soup broth to be found in the dan dan ramen, as you would expect from any 'ramen' or 'udon' in Japan. I probably wouldn't have minded this as much if the noodles were not devoid of any flavor other than salt. The taste was so utterly bland I didn't even bother to finish the ""full-size"" yet small portion that I received. There was barely a hint of a peanut taste aside from the peanuts themselves. When the server came back around to ask me how everything was I told her everything but the food was good, which I don't think I've ever done actually. This was just THAT bad.

I truly don't understand how this place is getting such good reviews. I have been in Japan multiple times and have had amazing flavor-rich dan dan ramen there on many occasions. This was just a disgrace to the dish. I can only assume most of the people that are visiting this place have not actually traveled anywhere that these dishes can be had with an authentic preparation.",0
oxeW1tSB-e_oIzCQZtqyTw,"First trip here. Happy hour, Date at the bar.

The steam buns were 2 for $5.   I thought the pulled pork and fried chicken stood out.  Noodle 1/2 portions were $5.  I'm no expert on ramen but I thought it was pretty delicious.  I don't care how authentic it is and quite frankly I wouldn't know.

Service was good. Atmosphere was dark and subdued but I was feeling it.

Great value. We'll be back",1
oxeW1tSB-e_oIzCQZtqyTw,"Just another Americanized disgrace in Cleveland. 
First time I went I got the California bowl with tofu and rice. Overall the flavor was average, tofu was alright, but the rice was god awful. It was still dripping wet and soggy, like they barely finished cooking it. This dish called for tacky rice but I basically received a rice soup bowl.
I tried this place again a few weeks later, hoping their ramen would be near authentic to Japanese ramen. Negatory. The broth was too over flavored and dark, like it was trying too hard. The udon noodles made it feel like I was fighting an octopus with my chop sticks.
Just an overall boring experience affirming Cleveland dumbs most cultural restaurants down",0
oxeW1tSB-e_oIzCQZtqyTw,"Having lived in Japan for a few years, I have tasted what I consider ""authentic"" ramen. When I moved to CLE, noodles were one of the things I missed the most. I was happily surprised, then, to heard of a ramen-ya (ramen shop) opening downtown. Boy was I disappointed. Noodlecat is to ramen what Sushirock in Cleveland is to the world-famous Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo-- a sad facsimile. The broth was off for both the Shoyu and Miso flavors, the noodles had a texture best described as ""unique"", and the buns we ordered as a side had an interesting filling-on-top conformation. None of this was a good thing.

As a fan of more ""authentic"" style ramen, I can say I will not be returning.",0
oxeW1tSB-e_oIzCQZtqyTw,"I'll say this for Noodlecat - and I'll say it to the haters who find its menu lacking in authenticity: this is the only ethnic restaurant where I have been able to happily eat with my parents. Ever. And that is no small feat. To offer an Asian-inspired menu, the palatability of which is broad enough to reach the tastebuds of my meat-and-potatoes papa is nothing short of incredible. 

On a recent visit, my husband, mother, father, and I sampled from across the menu:

- Roasted Brussel Sprouts - a favorite.
- Pork and Brisket Steam Buns - a crowd pleaser, to be sure.
- BBQ Miso Chicken Wings - another fan favorite. You're on a roll, Noodlecat!
- Pork Miso - lacking in vegetable and a tad rich, but very enjoyable
- Dan Dan Noodles - the clunker. Spicy, but that was the only flavor. Otherwise, quite bland.

The service we received last Saturday evening was almost comically bad! Our poor waiter clearly had no idea what he was doing. I have empathy for sub-par service: waiting tables is not everyone's chosen career and it's difficult work! I won't knock a restaurant based on the actions of a hapless 20-something earning tips to pay for beer and text books, but this lack of professionalism certainly didn't add to the experience.

Bottom line: if you want authentic ramen, you have plenty of other choices. If you want a fun, fairly affordable meeting spot downtown where you can score some flavorful appetizers before a show, Noodlecat is a great pick!",0
oxeW1tSB-e_oIzCQZtqyTw,"Stopped by for dinner and wasn't entirely disappointed. I had the Takahachi Ramen, Tonkatsu Steam Bun, and a Chocolate Peanut Butter Banana Steam Bun to top it off. We also shared some Miso BBQ Twice-Cooked Crispy Chicken Wings. Was the ramen authentic by any means? Not really. But Noodlecat is more of a fusion place than anything else, so I wasn't expecting it. 

Aside from the prices being a little steep, my main complaint was the server. Although he was incredibly nice and polite, the overweight man had an intense body odor so bad I couldn't eat while he was standing near the table, and had sweat stains swooping around the collar of his shirt. 

All in all, I'd most likely return next time I'm in town.",0
oxeW1tSB-e_oIzCQZtqyTw,"Based on the bleeeh reviews of Noodlecat I have to say I was a bit intimidated to try it, but I was in the area for a show on East 4th and had a noodle craving so the stars aligned. 

Luckily, we were also there during happy hour and $1 beers cannot be beat! The happy hour listings seem to vary between online and in restaurant (mainly half bowls- are these a thing??). Picklebacks are on the happy hour menu and I probably would never do that again. Luckily I had that $1 beer to chase my chaser with. 

The menu was actually a lot smaller than I thought it would be and a lot of the items seemed more fusion based than ""authentic"" which might be a pro or a con depending on your preferences. We ordered the Pork Miso and the Hangover Ramen and were both very happy with them. Nothing makes me happier than soft eggs and noodles.

We were one of the only tables there which felt odd since it was basically prime dinner time but I guess on weeknights downtown probably isn't too crowded. We had two servers due to shift change and the first girl was remarkably better than the guy that replaced her. I feel bad because we were about 5-10 minutes before getting our checks when she left and then the new guy let us sit for a half hour before showing back up. 

All in all I would definitely come back to try some of their other options!",1
oxeW1tSB-e_oIzCQZtqyTw,"It has been a while since I've walked around downtown Cleveland and wow, has it changed.  Lots of trendy restaurants, bars, and clubs have opened up or are being planned.  I really do hope that the trend continues.  Having said that, I really wanted to LOVE Noodlecat and give it 5 stars as I hope this restaurant and all these newer places thrive and help rejuvenate the downtown area.

But my first visit to Noodlecat for an off-Friday lunch was a bit of a let-down.  The food was good, and according to Yelp, three stars = ""A-OK"" and the meal was just that.  It did not blow me away.  I had the Lunch Complete (see the photo)  which cost $17 and includes any noodle bowl, a side salad, a rice ball, some pickled veggies, grilled pepper (not shown) and a tiny chocolate/orange covered pudding-like dessert.  For my noodle, I picked the Pork Miso Ramen.  The actual ramen noodles were ok, but the broth which is so important in such noodle soups was on the salty side to me and wasn't particularly savory.  I just ate the noodles and wasn't tempted to spoon up and slurp the broth.  For the price, a bit more shredded pork would have been appreciated.  None of the accompaniments really stood out other than the miniature dessert which was very tasty.

I'm willing to go again at some point just to try a few other menu items or possibly as part of an evening downtown enjoying other area attractions.  But if I'm in the mood for a great noodle soup, I would probably choose an authentic Chinese or Vietnamese place which also avoids having to deal with downtown parking.  Best of luck to the Chef and Noodlecat -- I'll update this review if I go again and if my opinion changes after meal #2.",0
OXHqelJ5pLNxpleebStKkA,Love this market! Great authentic food. It's THE place I get tabbouleh and hummus! I also frequently buy their fresh marinated meat and always love the kabobs! The owners are always very pleasant! Glad this markets only 5 minutes from my house ;),1
OXHqelJ5pLNxpleebStKkA,"Your experience here will depend on what you're looking for. 

As many reviews mentioned, the shawermas are truly incredible. The beef shawarma sandwich is especially notable for it's authentic taste, carrying the right seasonings and herbs. Word of caution: ask for the hot sauce on the side if you must. Their hot sauce is basically lava masquerading as food; it overshadows any flavors your food might have and might give you a crying kardashian face. I just feel the shawarmas are terrific without it. Food is takeout only. 

The hummus from deli section gets a lot of praise and it's all well deserved. Its freshness is addictive. Pair it with the fresh pita bread that gets delivered to this store and you have yourself a simple snack/light meal right there.  

They do have a fresh meat section from where I haven't tried anything (yet). I can say however that meat section is neat and clean and does not have the kind of odor issues that are common with meat sections of supermarkets.  

As an international store, they have a good selection of Pakistani, Indian and middle eastern grocery items. That also means you'll run into things you may not have seen before and might want to try.",1
OXHqelJ5pLNxpleebStKkA,Delicious and authentic foods straight from the coast. The staff are also pleasant to talk to. I always seem to leave with more than what I was looking for as well which is the sign of a good facility.,1
OyhCNhJJuJjUt2avxI5POg,"Considering that it was after midnight, the food was pretty good. I had a smokey grilled cheese sandwich that was comprised of cheddar, gouda, bacon and tomato. The side of fresh kettle chips...delicious. I also had a creme brulee martini. The creme brulee part was authentic flavor. The liquor, though, tasted cheap. It reminded me of rubbing alcohol. Would I go again? Maybe. I wouldn't go for a martini though.",0
OzRGWW5R05kC0pQyUHX3lg,"Well I disagree with most of the reviews for Guarinos, because I still think you guys should give it a try if you are looking for truly authentic Italian food. Lasagna and cannelloni are both excellent, and for $14 you do leave pretty full. I went here for Valentine's day and I couldn't have been happier with their adorable setup and specials going on, some may call it tacky, but I call it homey...
I first found out about Guarinos on a school field trip, ironically enough the owner said how romantic it would be to come with your date sometime, so I did a few months later and it definitely lived up to my expectations. I'm not giving five stars because my first experience with the manicotti was not the best, quite small in my opinion. But yesterday made up for it. 
Again, as mentioned, I really appreciate the history along with this restaurant too. Being the oldest restaurant and family owned business in Cleveland is pretty cool. So guys, andare a mangiare!",1
OzRGWW5R05kC0pQyUHX3lg,Overall the meal was good. The atmosphere is nice but needs a little cleaning. I ordered the lasagna and it was a very healthy portion but the center was cool. The flavor was very good and layered well. The bread was fresh but a little disappointed it did not automatically come with olive oil and vinegar but I had to ask. I'm spoiled by other authentic Italian spots that do the traditional stuff. Nice place and I will come again. My daughter loved her spaghetti !!!!,1
OzRGWW5R05kC0pQyUHX3lg,"Guarino's is hands down the most romantic, most authentic Italian restaurant in cleveland.  I was shocked reading the other reviews. My husband and I  go at least once a month to get our fix! We're always greeted immediately, usually the hostess accompanied by the owner. The owner usually doesn't remember us but we cut him slack considering he's kept the traditions of Guarino's alive! We almost went to Mia Bella tonight but one glance at the new, hipster-like vibe it has going on,  we decided we couldn't cheat on our classic date night. 

Although I'm skeptical of letting out my secret... as a 3 glass per meal- white wine lover, it's a bit hard buying an entire bottle instead of by the glass but no worries.  One small word to the owner and our problem solved. 

The food is fantastic. We generally eat an entire loaf of this so-called ""stale"" bread...... tastes pretty good to me! Especially with the serve-yourself Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. 

We've been treated nothing short of family every single time we eat here. Many of the reviews I've read have something negative to say about the servers.... if you enjoy fake smiles, laughs and smalltalk- go somewhere else. These servers are genuine. Just how we like em! :)",1
OzRGWW5R05kC0pQyUHX3lg,"This place makes you feel right at home! We did not have a reservation but the owner found us a table in the beautiful terrace in the back. Our server, Anthony, was attentive and professional. The ambiance was on point - classy yet casual. The bruschetta was fresh, a light and authentic starter and the entree, Frutti Di Mare , was light yet filling. We topped off the night with a dessert cocktail called Sleep When You're Dead. It was recommended by our server and exceeded our expectations! This restaurant has a family feel and Italian charm. Highly recommend for anyone!",1
OzRGWW5R05kC0pQyUHX3lg,"We intended on going to Mamma Santas after a day at the art museum on Sunday. But we found out from a nice oldster sitting on a bench near by that ""thaya antta openia on the Sundays"". So we ended up at Guarinos. 

We sat inside b/c a wedding was on the back patio. The decor inside is frightening. And the food mirrored that as well. Goopy, outta the jar, no love from Nonna style food. Hard rolls, pathetic house salad, and the worst marinara sauce. I really have had more ""authentic"" at the Olive Garden.",0
OzRGWW5R05kC0pQyUHX3lg,"Truly authentic Italian - great food & wine combined with outstanding service.  Had to have one person's gluten free - it was and as tasty as regular pasta & they took care to avoid cross-contamination.  Waitress, Meagan, was super.  When in the area try it!!",1
OzRGWW5R05kC0pQyUHX3lg,"We had a nice leisurely family dinner on their patio. I ordered their lasagna, my husband got the manicotti, and my son got the gnocchi. I could have drank their red sauce in a glass, it was that good! The lasagna was probably the best I've ever had. This is not the type of place that you go to for a quick meal. They take their time and do things right. Our service was good and the food very very good! If you want an authentic Italian meal then this is place for you.",1
OzRGWW5R05kC0pQyUHX3lg,"You can never go wrong at Guarinos! This place reminds me of an old Italian Sunday family dinner, with authentic decor!! Everything on the menu is old classic recipes that taste home made. The chicken parm and eggplant roll ups are the tops. It's such a nice classy place, we even had our rehearsal dinner here for our wedding! The owners take care of you from the minute you step in! A must go in little Italy!",1
OzRGWW5R05kC0pQyUHX3lg,"Mama Mia this authentic Italian is delicious!  The manicotti was one of the best dishes I've had in Little Italy.  The ricotta was creamy and delicious, and the sauce was perfect for my taste buds.  

My partner had the Chicken Piccata and was pleased with the dish.  I wasn't a fan of the garlic bread and cheese as the garlic was a bit extreme and the cheese was lacking, although I've been told that's how true Italian garlic bread is served.

The service was good, and the restaurant has its own parking lot which is a rarity in this neighborhood.",1
OzRGWW5R05kC0pQyUHX3lg,"Located in Cleveland - Little Italy - a quaint little district for the more mature crowd if you will.  The area is also close to University Sq/Circle.  

Anyway, back to Guarino's !  When in Rome....   
oh that's right I am in Cleveland!  Oh well, this is darn close!!! 

Make a reservation!  This place is hot and happening! Busy busy!  Didn't have a reservation - and got lucky!  We sat outside on the back patio which is simply lovely! 
Piano player entertained those of us outside.  There were heaters for those who were slightly chilled.   Anyway, back to the piano man.  He played classic oldies ... which was perfect!   

The manger was exceptional!  Pleasant, accommodating and friendly. 

The server was lovely as well.  She was very busy, bless her heart... but very nice!

You are served bread with oil and vinegar ...  tasty.
We ordered calamari... cooked with garlic and Parmesan seasoning.  Honestly, it is a very generous portion and quiet delicious. $12

Dinner: Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken ~ get your fork ready, tie up your bib, and get ready to wrap your lips around this mouth watering dish!  Sauce is freshly made and dished perfectly!  A must try!!  The portion is more than enough!  $17

Linguine with clam sauce ~ excellent!  If you enjoy this dish anywhere else ... trust me when I say this is like no other !  Seasoned and cooked perfectly !   Portion size was more than enough!  $19

Inside dinning is very ""old Italian"" which is a nice touch!  A band plays inside as well.  There is a bar to wet your whistle.  

If you want good authentic Italian cuisine - this is a must! 
Excellent on all points!

* NOTE ~ only recommendation is to relocate the server station outside!  Servers were very loud and honestly it took away from the piano player.  I know the manager spoke to them and tried his best to move and adjust the room divider they have outside, but ...  

The price:  Walked out paying less than $60 - we don't drink (as a side note).  The prices are very fair considering the taste and the portion size!  

Truly a place to dine !  We will definitely dine there again! 

Side note : Veterans eat free on Veterans Day !!! 

Folks stop in and enjoy the food - exceptional!!!!",1
p1eUTUB_5hf1enoKYBV3DA,"After one visit, this place became my favorite restaurant. I went there this summer and had some antipasto which was the perfect tuneup for the main event which is the pizza. It's super thin crust but not crispy. The toppings are sparse and super fresh. The cheese is fresh mozzarella- not too much. It is authentic, amazing Italian pizza. It is totally different from regular pizza parlor pizza (which I love) and it is worth the hefty price. Once you try it you'll understand. A glass of red wine and any one of their pizzas and you're good.

Another interesting thing they do there that makes it great for a date is that they offer some sort of unusual item that's not on the menu that they make for you right at your table. One time it was a dessert that featured black pepper. Such a weird idea you have to try it. Another time it was some kind of Italian dessert cheese cut into a delicate 'flower' at your table and drizzled with honey. Both excellent and memorable. It changes from day to day.

The people who work there take their job seriously and do Ken Stewart proud. You know you're in a nice place.  At the other Ken Stewart locations you get so much food you don't need to eat for a week (which is good because you couldn't afford it anyway) but at Tre Bella, it's just right. A plate of antipasto, split a pizza and a bottle of wine and you can still walk when dinner is done.

Great place. Ken Stewart's best.",1
P3LC20iTwxv7CicqgNUXzA,"Good pizza and when I was there the smoker was firing up some authentic smelling barbecue.  Partial to my Chicago Pie, and NY preference, but this is good stuff.",1
p5uB6cp17euTJSG6AV3f4Q,"Braai is an Afrikaans word that roughly translates to ""barbecue,"" but it encompasses the whole culture of the practice (a social event with friends, lingering over good food and conversation with some good beer and wine, specific foods that are always present, etc.), not just the food itself--perhaps the closest thing in American English would be the phrase ""backyard barbecue.""

When I saw the word braai on the door, I instantly knew this was authentic and that I had to stop in, even though I had intended to go elsewhere for lunch.

Peri-peri chicken is so moist and flavorful. Delish. Spicy is actually not very spicy, so order spicy even if you're not a capsaicin-head. (If you like REALLY spicy, you may be disappointed and might want to ask if they have anything hotter.)

Secret weapon on the menu is the boerewors roll. It's a homemade sausage in a hot dog bun. Hard to describe for Americans, but think of something in the size/shape of a hefty bratwurst but with a much softer, crumblier texture (sort of like a Turkish Adana kebab or something) and a soft, meaty flavor (not salty or spicy or anything). Literally just like the boerewors I had in my friend's back yard in Cape Town. Here's the kicker: it's $3.95 AND comes with a huge glut of steak fries. Best deal in Ohio.

GO.",1
p5uB6cp17euTJSG6AV3f4Q,"We have a sad dearth of African restaurants of any kind in Cleveland, so I was excited to see this new place, and even more excited when I tried it. Very friendly proprietors who care about the food and extremely tasty dishes.

I'm looking forward to trying more dishes and hoping they can survive in the largely empty Arcade food court.",1

p6Rf2hsyF1eYVJk9ag3W2A,"SO GREAT!! I came after a long morning of moving my dorm things into a storage unit. The day was really hot and I came across Mason's creamery on the way home. From the outside, it looks small and it's a little hard to find. But, one of the walls is painted black with funky letters spelling out 'Come over all the time!'
Mason's creamery has unique flavors and they're all super fresh! The owners are a husband and wife duo who frequently staff the store and they are very helpful and social! I was blown away by their Thai Tea ice cream and my friend's taro milkshake! The milkshake was really creamy but kept an authentic taro flavor. Definitely some of the best ice cream I've ever had!",1
p6Rf2hsyF1eYVJk9ag3W2A,"The ice cream here is fabulous.  They have very unique flavors here - the lychee flavor in particular was delicious.

But.. the real reason I wanted to write this review was to comment on this restaurant's ramen night.  Widely publicized in Cleveland foodie circles on Facebook, this little ice cream shop decided to take on a valiant endeavor during two weekends in the winter to try to introduce authentic Japanese ramen to the Cleveland community.  I attended the second ramen night, and I am pretty certain there will be a third.

While I applaud these guys for the effort, I unfortunately was disappointed by their ramen.  The ramen broth was great, the meat was great (though a bit on the fatty side and I wished I had more of it), and the egg nearly perfect (slightly on the raw side).  However, the noodles did them in.  The noodles were doughy and quite unpleasant.

I am hoping that for the third ramen night, these will find a different source for their noodles.  Then I'd definitely be coming back for a second helping.",1
p6Rf2hsyF1eYVJk9ag3W2A,"Loved this place- wish it was closer to my home.  Though I had tried Mason's Creamery at the Asian Festival a couple years ago, it wasn't until I heard about their ramen night that I was inspired do drive all the way into Cleveland to get some legit ramen.  I didn't make it to the first ramen night, but I'm proud to say that I was first in line for the second one.  They didn't let me down.  The ramen was really good- even after I had taken it, driven 25 minutes home and waited for my family to sit down and eat.  Broth was DELICIOUS.  Just like it is supposed to be.  I didn't want to share with The Wife and The In-laws.  Next time, I'll order more.  Great job with the pork belly- done perfectly.  Noodles had congealed a little bit by the time I got home, so they weren't ideal, but it was definitely better than any other ramen I've had in CLE.  They should make it a permanent part of their menu.  And move into a bigger facility- crowds would definitely come.

Since I was already in the area, I figured that I'd try a pint or two of their ice cream.  I got vietnamese coffee (AMAZING- even my wife who isn't easy to please raved about it).  Creamy, authentic, drizzled with condensed milk.  I'll order more next time I go out there.  Lychee sorbet was less successful.  The texture was off- even if the flavor was legit lychee.  I wonder if it could have been pureed more to get a better mouth feel for it.

Anyways, an awesome experience.  If I lived near to them, I'd be there all the time, especially if they served that awesome ramen.",1
p6Rf2hsyF1eYVJk9ag3W2A,"Came here for the ramen!  Next time I do come here, I will be trying out their sweet treats.  Unfortunately it aaa way too cold for me to even think about ice cream.  So I heard that during the winter months in Cleveland, they will be serving Ramen to go!  They don't have it on their walls but if you ask the worker if they are serving ramen they will either give you the options (pork or vegetable) or they will tell you they are fresh out.  They make some in a first come first serve basis.  The broth was delicious and the ingredients were in a separate container.  Those include ramen noodles, the tiny sticks of mushrooms, seaweed, corn, and radish. (There may have been more but I can't remember)

Because they are not known to be a ramen shop, I will give it to them.  Everything seemed very authentic and delicious but I wish it was hot when I ate it rather than room temperature.  But if I would of liked it hotter, it would probably melt the containers, so I can't be upset about it.  The ramen is pretty pricey, but they don't have a lot of ramen shops in Cleveland.  So definitely try this place out and don't forget the sweet treat! Because I'm regretting not taking home the toasted pistachio!",1

In detail: 
I've been eating lunch here at least once a week for the last year or so. They are quick and friendly, if a little hard to hear over the hubbub. They also are quick to recognize repeat customers with a bright smile and extra dose of friendly. 

The food, while I cannot attest to ""authenticity"" is very tasty, and the spicy dishes even have a good bit of heat to them- more so than many convenience Asian food places, especially here in Ohio. Additionally, the dishes are very fresh, not just ""recently heated"". They also have hot oil and chopsticks on request, which is nice.

I would prefer a side of hummus, a fresh sm. salad, or some tabouli. For the price, Aladdin's offers better quality, larger portions, great peaceful atmosphere, and excellent service. I could not say the same about Falafel Cafe. We decided to check it out today for lunch. It is however a great location, and my boyfriend and I live in Cleveland Heights and frequently visit University Circle. I'd been wanting to try this place for probably a year. I'd point it out every time we drove by. Well, I was overall disappointed with both the food and service. I disliked the shishtawook sandwich. It was mushy, and bland. Not much chicken & I couldn't taste the hummos. The service wasn't excellent. The wait was long for just a couple sandwiches. I felt kind of grossed out that the bus-boy cleaned up tables, then handled our glasses and refilled our drinks. The people working there were pleasant, but they weren't busy and they seemed disorganized. The bus-boy didn't have to refill our drinks, our server should have...and I don't know what she was doing the entire time.",0

p9wsRYjSo4yIb14ijaNEnA,"Microwaved salmon specials, soggy fries, bland falafel.. Meh I've experienced better indeed.

OK, I have given this place a fair chance, went there at least 10 times within 5 years and 8/10 times have been disappointed or grossed out by something I ordered

The good (sort of):
-The lamb, beef, chicken served with hummus and pita is quite tasty, has a good amount of acidity, and vigorously seasoned - only slight complaint is that it is always overcooked, even for middle eastern cuisine standards

-Hummus, they've got the texture down (not too goopy, not too thick), and I think this is one of their star menu items. Shouldve called themselves 'hummus cafe' instead. I personally do prefer it a little more acidic, and more 

The bad:
-Perhaps it was my because of naivety that I order salmon at a place called ""Falafel Cafe"", but hey it was their 'daily special' and I happened to be craving salmon that day. After about two bites, I discovered the middle was frozen, literally ice frozen. I sent it back, they apologized. But then .. instead of tossing it in a pan or oven, they threw it in the microwave. Im sorry, but whatever excuse you may have, you don't have 'daily specials' of frozen anything, then cook it when it hasnt properly defrosts, then microwave it to thaw. That actually made me laugh.. it was so miserable

-After not ordering any specials from them again for over 2 years (I opted for falafel wrap and their beef & hummus platter usually), I decided to give them another try. Out of stupidity, and just wanting to try something new, I ordered a fried fish patty 'daily special'. Yup you guessed it, straight out of the freezer and into the frier. It wasn't frozen this time, but it was so disgustingly greasy I couldn't finish it. This was nearly 2 years ago, and I still have not forgotten that greasy, reused oil stench in the back of my throat. Lesson learned, don't order any 'daily specials'

-The falafel wrap. For a place called ""Falafel Cafe"" you would expect the falafel to be incredible, but in all honesty, it would rank last next to Aladdins/Algebra Tea House/Mad Greek/Tommy's! It is bland as can be, dry almost without fail, and the outside never delivers on that crispiness you yearn

-The pies are mediocre, always dry from sitting day in and day out. I can't speak for what authentic lebanese pies are like, but I think it would be so much better with less bread and more stuffing. But hey, at under $3 a pop, you really can't complain. But just to let you know, if you want these pies heated, that also means microwave.. you know how undesirable microwaved pizza bread is? Well that's what happens to their pies when they zap it

All the positive review you get about this place are about how friendly the owners are (I agree), and how cheap the food is (I also agree). But being friendly and cheap doesn't mean good food and I hope they can find ways to stop taking so many shortcuts, occasionally change their frying oil, actually having FRESH daily specials, and perfecting that falafel!

p9wsRYjSo4yIb14ijaNEnA,This place has fairly decent food. I usually get a shawarma sandwich with fries or hummas. The food is authentic and fresh.  My issue with this place is the service. The staff is very rude. I speak Arabic and on multiple occasions have witnessed them talking about customers. I would not recommend this place!,0
p9wsRYjSo4yIb14ijaNEnA,Enjoyed this amazing place!! Love the fact that it is Zabihah and the food is very tasty and authentic!! Certified halal!! Service was great!! The quantity was more than enough!! Great seating for Niqabee sisters!! My sister wears the Niqab and we both were able to eat here comfortably!! Strongly suggest the Hummas and Chicken Philly,1
p9wsRYjSo4yIb14ijaNEnA,Yummy! I tried the falafel wrap and gyro. So tasty and filling! The falafel isn't very authentic (methinks); lots of breadcrumbs,1
p9wsRYjSo4yIb14ijaNEnA,"I feel like Falafel Cafe is a leftover from a few years back, when the food offerings on this stretch of Euclid consisted of abysmal pizza, nasty Chinese take out, Starbucks pastry, a very ghetto McDonalds, and this place. Among that group of contenders, I recall that Falafel Cafe seemed downright appealing: it was affordable, vaguely edible, and quick enough to grab for lunch.

Now, though, all I can notice is that the food isn't particularly authentic, the staff isn't terribly friendly, and everything is a fair bit greasier than it should be. I'm not convinced that Falafel Cafe has gotten any worse--it's just that the competition has gotten that much better.

The last time I came in, my friend and I were the only two customers and it still took a solid five minutes for someone to bother serving us. My shish taouk wrap was drowning in grease (albeit slightly tasty) and the fries were soggy. At the end of the meal, we had to go up to the counter and beg for our check, despite still being the only two customers.

Falafel Cafe needs to step up their game. With all the great new options in the Uptown district, serving ""edible"" just no longer suffices.",0
p9wsRYjSo4yIb14ijaNEnA,"I have never tried the falafel or the gyros here (I go to the West Side Market for those).
BUT the burgers are actually really good here. They have salmon burgers, too, which is a salmon patty (not a fillet). The french fries are delicious, made from scratch with the skin still on. Actually, I think it's the fries that make the burgers so good.
The spinach or meat pies leave something to be desired. They're too doughy, not enough flavorful filling. It's tempting to get one because they're cheap, but they just pop them in the microwave, so I'd recommend getting something else.

oh, and I actually see middle eastern people eating here (unlike Aladdin's). So you know what that means: this place is authentic. Bonafide. Ethnic.
I got a feeling that those customers aren't getting the burgers and fries. I think I saw one guy eating the hummus. 
So THAT's what I'm getting next time.",1
par8VO9cAg-wAmRIlYlpgQ,"Just like plain...old...ordinary...ICE CREAM.  . . .NOT frozen custard.

This review is for the Fairview Park location.  I can't speak for the others.  (About 15 years ago their Pearl Road location was more like ""frozen custard""---nothing at all like this questionable relative in Fairview Park.)

I've given them about 4 tries in the last 8 years (twice within the last year)---and ONLY because I happen to live near-by.  Ordered the same thing each time:  vanilla frozen custard---maybe their most frequently requested option.  And each of those times it was EXACTLY the same, but was NEVER frozen custard.  

Firm, crystalized texture, overly-sweet, too ""artificially-enhanced"" tasting , not smooth, not creamy, not rich, not quick to melt, and not anything at all like frozen custard SHOULD be.  If the right ingredients (and ratios) for FROZEN CUSTARD were used, and the correct steps were followed in its preparation, the result would be real frozen custard---not this.  It's nothing more than run-of-the-mill, not even close to premium, ice cream.  This isn't cynicism, it's honesty.  

Their prominent sign says ""frozen custard""---a guarantee to draw more in than the words ""ice cream"".   What's happened here, is a failure of ""truth in advertising"" .  Anyone who's tried East Coast, then had the REAL thing---and WANTS the real thing---will drive right past without stopping.  I'd never even thought to write a review.  Why take my time saying something negative about a place that was popular?  If customers liked it, fine.  What they didn't know wouldn''t hurt them.  Maybe true, but not totally.  It MAY hurt those who DO offer the authentic---the ones who've earned the right to call theirs FROZEN CUSTARD.  I'm sure there are a handful of others in Cuyahoga and surrounding counties, but see below for my recommendation*.  This previous, and what follows, convinced me to write a review. 

Asking 2.75 for a medium cone of milky vanilla ice crystals is criminal.  75 cents would be more in line.  Authentic frozen custard---if served the traditional way in order to maintain it's rich, silky-smooth texture---is dispensed directly from the unit that it's made in---not scooped out of a tub like it's done at East Coast.  I'm absolutely, whole-heartedly, in favor of promoting and supporting local businesses whose advertising claims can be trusted and offer a fair value, but if one cannot be up-front and honest, and even go as far as naming ones business something they aren't---thereby taking unfair advantage of those who aren't informed---I had to speak up.  
.    

TURKEY HILL 
On sale, just $3 for a ""short"" 1/2 gallon---price of a single EC cone. ""Homemade Vanilla"" (fabu!!!ous) plus many other flavors, too. This isn't frozen custard, but the most premium of commercially available ice creams we've ever had.  

BEST FOR LAST
* DAIRY KING on Lorain Road in North Olmsted.  REAL frozen custard.  They offer their regular, lower-priced ""soft serve"", too, for the less-discriminating kiddie and pooch palates.  YOU ask for the ""Old Fashioned"", one memorable indulgence.

Pawavw9U8rjxWVPU-RB7LA,"This place is very interesting! I first found this place when I was thinking about places to take my parents to. I know my parents would only eat asian food, so this is one of the places we visited.

My first time there, it was a pleasant experience. My dad was too lazy to read the menu so he went talk to the owner (this place is owned by an old couple), and just named some dishes that he would like to eat. They are not even on the menu but since the dishes my dad wanted were pretty well-known in China, the owner had no problem cooking them and serving us. They tasted DELICIOUS and just like my mom's cooking! I was SO SURPRISED that such authentic Chinese food exist in the U.S.

I was so excited about this place that I took my boyfriend there after my parents left. Since I am not as brave and ""friendly"" as my dad, I just ordered stuff that's on the menu, and the food was kinda disappointing - they tasted just like any other chinese restaurants in the U.S. - americanized chinese food, but they are not bad at all, just not as MSG charged as other chinese restaurants in town.

Overall, not a bad place to go for REALLY CHEAP chinese food and if you speak chinese or know something about chinese food, go talk to the owner (the lady) and she might surprise you!",1
Pawavw9U8rjxWVPU-RB7LA,"Sketchiness practically radiates from the storefront, which is not really a storefront but a bunch of floor to ceiling windows covered by long vertical blinds. Inside, it doesn't get much better, but those who have grown up in my father's generation in China will immediately recognize the communal-style layout. A part of me wonders whether the ""Out of Service"" sign on the bathroom has been there as long as the vintage soda vending machine. 

It's a mom-and-pop shop in the rawest sense (although I'm not actually sure if they have children or not); the duo performs everything from ordering (at the counter), cooking, and cleaning. They take only cash now, and you can pay as soon as you order or wait until you're done eating. Mr. ""Richie Chan"" doesn't talk much - I'm not sure if it's because he doesn't know English very well, but even after we started talking in Chinese he wasn't talkative. We had to shout a few times as well to draw his attention away from the TV to take our order. The Mrs. was much more outgoing and chatted with us later about the unusual characters that came in through the door. 

We were the only patrons in the restaurant at the time, although two piles of dirty dishes on the smaller two (out of three) tables revealed that others had potentially also dined in. Most people get take-out, and given the uncomfortable encounters we had with the people who came in, I probably would too in the future. The food was cheap, and our three dishes (which included rice) and soup ended up lasting us through two meals. The Hunan Beef wasn't spicy so much as sour and I would not recommend it, but their Mu Shu Pork is the real deal. We were served complementary orange slices after the meal. 

Okay, so this isn't exactly on my list of best restaurants, but as far as authenticity goes, most of it is legit. The ""Chans"" are honest folks and keep it simple.",0
Pawavw9U8rjxWVPU-RB7LA,"I visit this place when I'm  hanging out in the HTS and want  quality Asian food. Yes this place looks sketchy, but is not. The kitchen is clean.

This is  a 2 person operation. I assume they are  husband and wife, as I have never seen other people working here. They have a small dinning room, it can seat maybe 10 or 12 people. Primarily this is takeout.

The menu has your typical American Chinese fair such as lomein, the generals, wonton soup..... On the flip side  they serve some fairly authentic stuff like baby bok dishes, hofun, black bean sauce, chinese broccoli fish etc....

I had baby bok choy with chicken and Chinese sausage. This was excellent, bok was fresh and perfectly cooked, chinese sausage gave the dish a slightly sweet but savory taste. 

Friend ordered chicken and broccoli, by the shear weight of the platter 2 people could have eaten this and been stuffed. This was much better quality than other carry out places in the area.
Prices are reasonable.
One thing, given them a few minutes to cook your food,  I did not see them taking any short cuts.",1
Pawavw9U8rjxWVPU-RB7LA,"Absolute authentic Cantonese dishes just like home-made! My favorite one if I want to taste food like home made. They might not offer fancy dishes that you can usually get in large Chinese restaurant, but you can find good dishes like steamed chicken, steamed fish, pork chop with soy bean, duck etc.

I like going there after evening classes. The owners are very nice and I can call to preorder my food. When I arrive, the food are ready in a minute. Great price that no one can beat and the portion is large.",1
Pawavw9U8rjxWVPU-RB7LA,"Thoroughly confused and hungry... that's what came to mind after reading the reviews of Richie Chan's then actually trying their food.  Yes, Richie Chan's is a hole in the wall and yes, it's definitely cheap.  My experience was awful leaving only my garbage can full.  In hindsight, I would have gotten a better meal across the street at CVS chowing down on potato chips and slim jim's.

When I try a new chinese place I stick with the basics before venturing off into your more advanced fair.  General Tso is about as basic as it gets.  Similar to another reviewer, I found that the chicken was pre-cooked slices, breaded, deep fried and drown in sauce.  You don't need to be an expert in cooking to realize that cooked chicken, cooked again in smaller pieces creates a dry, fibrous and tasteless experience.  Combine that with the over-fried batter and it was like a rawhide treat for your dog.

The chicken wasn't the only overcooked disappointment for the afternoon.  An order of crab rangoon was just as disappointing.  Instead of crunchy but light wonton shell with a creamy filling, it too was overcooked rock hard and tasteless.

At some point this place may have been a great place to eat but they have now gone down the path of pre-prepared and overcooked food with loads of sauces to cover up the taste.  Perhaps the ""authentic"" fare is better but when they're cutting corners and messing up on the basics, I'd rather try my luck elsewhere.",0
Pawavw9U8rjxWVPU-RB7LA,"Easily the tastiest and most authentic Chinese food in the University Heights area, and at a reasonable price. I took off a star mainly because they only accept cash, which is pretty inconvenient.

Admittedly, I have only had two of their dishes (Kung Pao chicken and cashew chicken), but the flavors slay the other Chinese-carryout restaurants in the area. Perhaps the biggest compliment to their quality, however, is that a lot of Chinese students from Case eat here. When you hear the Chinese language being spoken in front of the counter and not just behind it, that says something about the food's authenticity, I think. (They specialize in Cantonese-style dishes, by the way.)

The signage outside is so meager you might wonder if they did this intentionally, just to prove to the world, ""Only weak businesses need signs."" Seriously, I have to think that Google maps and Yelp are the only reasons anyone new to the area knows about this place.

The inside is quite humble, between the folding tables (which they keep clean, I should note), out-of-service vending machine, and home-printed wall menus. On a positive note, Richie's usually empty, which means you can expect your food rather quickly.

Contrary to what some reviewers have written, the bathroom isn't actually out-of-order like the sign on its door says. You just need to ask for the key. Weird, I know. But this is Richie Chan's, and you're here for one thing: good Chinese food.",0
Pawavw9U8rjxWVPU-RB7LA,"Little hole in the wall carry out Chinese place on Lee Rd. This shit is pretty good. They are really nice also. Gave me an orange with my to go order. Definitely mom and pop place. They even have authentic stuff. It is pretty reasonable as well. The only caution is that if you get hot and sour soup ask for it Chinese style as it may be sweet and lacking pork of you don't. Any of the dishes with Chinese broc are great, black bean, and the typical Americanized Chinese shit is ok as well. If you map this location west, it is the best food till you get to Clev Chinatown, The only thing better is Hun an East but they close by 9pm. For what it is worth this place rules for what it  is, great for later night munchies.",1
Pawavw9U8rjxWVPU-RB7LA,"This place had AWESOME authentic cantonese food.  The pea pods were as good as something I would get in chicago and their tomato beef tasted like what my grandma would make.  I highly recommend this place. Very reasonable, we ordered peapds with pork, tomato egg, general tsos chicken, and cantonese shrimp omelette for $39.50. They threw in a bag of shrimp chips and two oranges.  Great service!",1
Pawavw9U8rjxWVPU-RB7LA,"The Verdict: Reminds me of home :')

The Food: Offers authentic Chinese (Cantonese) food along with fast Chinese food staples. I had Cantonese chow fun w/ chicken and the noodles were crispy and the wet sauce is meant to be poured over the crispy noodles. It totally hits the spot! My friend got the egg foo young and it's a clear-like sauce with egg and meat and veggies over rice. That dish was very well made too!

The Extras: Great affordable prices. There's a parking lot on the side, tables, and you have a view of the clean and large kitchen. The 2 workers are super nice and speak English, Mandarin, and Cantonese. Their cooking is not superior restaurant quality, it reminds me more of dishes your Chinese parents would cook.",1

pDo0JIwBsVHEhcWKGDojXA,"Ohio City Burrito did not disappoint! I came here with a friend for lunch. We both had never been here and were looking forward to trying it. She got a burrito with the chicken tinga and all of the other fixings. I got the tacos Mexicanos with chicken instead of the barbacoa. We both got the agua Fresca to drink, which was pretty sweet but tasty! My tacos, while tasty, only came with some onions and cilantro. I ordered a side of guacamole to spice them up a bit and it helped a lot! 

I would definitely come back here. It was like chipotle, but better and more authentic!",1
pDo0JIwBsVHEhcWKGDojXA,As usual great authentic ingredients in all their entree's this location is just as great as their West 25 th location! If your still eating at that other competitors on Euclid Ave you don't know what your missing ! My favorite is the shredded chicken on the tacos de Mexicanos. Their corn salsa and pick great . The only qualm their evening hours they let the meat sit too long it drys out and you can clearly see it. The other day I visited had to choose chicken on my bowl all the other meats were Frye's out burned looking . The fajita vegetables was floating in water.,1

phNLAB-ZK-DgBYsLh2rd7g,"I like this place. I'm not a huge beer drinker, but I still really enjoyed going.
My friend saw it on Instagram and we decided to give it a try. We went on a Friday night around 11 pm.

Pros:
1. Parking right outside. Anyone with free and easily accessible parking, especially in the Cleveland area, is run by saints.
2. I like the vibe. They had books and board games. I couldn't find the board games when I first arrived. They're on the bottom of a bookshelf relatively close to the bar area. (Don't be like me and not look below eye level) I liked the historical background. It didn't seem fake or a marketing ploy, it seemed like an older authentic brewery. 
3. Beer was good. The flight option was nice, especially because I hadn't been there before. 

Cons:
None. I'll be back soon. 

It's definitely trendy, but it does seem like enough people know about it where it is annoying to go/overcrowded. Just a few hipster. A slightly older crowd than the West 25th youthful partying. Just wait until everyone finds out about it... 

I heard they do some cool events there, so I'm looking forward to those.",1

Pj0rFqv0EcdNdlpnRvLZBg,Callaloo is one of the few places you can get authentic Trini food in Cleveland. The owner is one of the friendliest men and was very attentive and insured we had a great time. I ordered the jerk chicken dinner which I have had at many Jamaican restaurants but I will say I definitely prefer it from Callaloo now. Caribbean food is very heavy on the spice so I do not recommend the jerk chicken to those who may not be able to handle heat.,1
Pj0rFqv0EcdNdlpnRvLZBg,"This place was totally authentic! Reminded me of jerk chicken that I had on the beach in Jamaica. My husband and I shared the jerk chicken platter and it was enough, not too full.

The food portions seem to be smaller, and without surprise, pricier. The chili-cheese fries are also gone. Overall, now, I really wouldn't go out of my way to get to TOAT, and that's saying something since I live only a couple blocks away and with walking could bypass parking problems in Ohio City. But meh, there are similar places to go, and so I shall, and leave TOAT to the crowds on W. 25th that seem willing to pay just to be in the happening spot, and overlook authenticity.",0
pM5OiwjOih7twp4mP0Rmhw,"This is hands down the best soccer bar cleveland has to offer. It is a hidden gem on west 25th and has some of the most authentic Irish fare around. I come here once a month on Saturday or Sunday to watch English premiere league, bundesliga, la liga or any sporting event. Usually visiting the West side market before or after eating. The open around 10, maybe earlier, but they only serve beer. The kitchen opens around 12 or 1230, at least on the weekends.the beer selection has the classics and some craft choices like fat heads or great lakes.

Food-wise, I have never had a bad meal. The buffalo basil chicken wings have outstanding flavor. The fries are always cooked to perfection, hand cut, come with house made ketchup and are generous in portion. All the sauces are made from scratch as far as I know. The craic head sandwich and the grilled cheese are reasonable prices, and consistently delicious. No need to order extra fries with either one. Even the mac and cheese is great, with a ton of cheese and very filling.  

If you are looking for a soccer bar with fish and chips, shepherd's pie, or bangers and mash this is the place to be. I would not bring kids here for a soccer game, unless you are fine with a roudy pub atmosphere. It is dimly lit but it scream authentic Irish pub. There is a warm fire place, plenty of big screens, and they always have sports on, like a sports bar should. The service is world class as well. If you see a guy in a green old angle shirt walking around, he makes this place go.

Come for the soccer, stay for the food  and keep it our secret! Supporters of any club welcome.",1

PPCuGwbGA7HlhsGh8dbBsA,Far and away the best and most authentic Indian food in Northeast Ohio. The quality of the ingredients is exceptional. Service is amazing and perhaps the best part of all they have a lunch buffet so if you are new to the type of food you can sample a good variety.,1
PPCuGwbGA7HlhsGh8dbBsA,"I'll start off by saying I really like Indian food. I'm a big ethnic food eater. Before finding out about Taj I used to go to Hot or Mild. I did a search on yelp for Indian buffet as I was curious if there was one on the east side of Cleveland. The results showed a few and today I decided to go with Taj India Palace. I never really go down the Wilson mills area/Richmond Mall area so I had to use my GPS. The restaurant is located in a little shopping plaza with Daves super market being the biggest part at the end. This location is pretty much across from the mall. I walked in just shy of noon and to my surprise only seen one table occupied. My first thoughts were well maybe they are slow but it is lunch time(by the time a left a hour later 3.4ths the dinning room was full). I was promptly greeted by a nice lady and was seated. I immediately went to the buffet to check out the offerings. You have a table next to the buffet that offers regular plates or you can use a metal plate more authentic option with dividers on it. The first table offers all the top meat dishes, the offerings on this table were tandoorie chicken, chicken tika masala, and chili chicken the table also included the naan bread. The next two buffets were filled with items such as cooked cabbage two different kinds of soups a dish with chick peas another with mixed veg. and it had pakora. The last table had chutneys and cold items. I really enjoy chicken tika masala so I ate my fair share of that dish. The tandorie chicken was nicely spiced and very very tender chicken meat and the onions in the pan tasted really good. I tried one soup called yellow dal I enjoyed that. I honestly tried a lot of stuff most of which I have no clue what was in it. None of it tasted bad I'm just a meat eater so the veg dishes aren't a big deal to me.A few minutes after you sit they bring out a item called dosa a type of crepe filled with potatoes you dip into chutney's. I will definitely be back for more as I pay $15 just for dinner carry out at hot or mild and I paid a little over $9 for my lunch buffet. Oh I also forget they offer two different kinds of rice one plain and another was lemon of some sort. They offer a buffet on the weekend for a few dollars more I asked what the difference was all I can recall was that have a goat dish I don't like goat to the best of my knowledge. I might try this place on the weekend to see the difference but This will be my go to spot now when I have time to stop in no longer will I go to hot or mild as much. I do wish the buffet included the items to make papdi chat that will be my only complaint haha Also the naan while most of it was soft some was crunchy but i'm sure that's just from sitting on a hot table. Go give this place your business. Even if you have never had Indian food before I ask you to ask your self a question. Why limit your self on food? Why not try ethnic foods? You might really enjoy it. The staff that I spoke with were very pleasant I even had a chat with a man who rang me out haha",1
PPCuGwbGA7HlhsGh8dbBsA,Our family just loves this place.  The owners are wonderful and treat us special every visit.  The food is great and very authentic.  Love the Naan bread and my favorite dish is the lamb Vindaloo and my wife loves the mugli chicken.  They have soup called samber which is outrageous.  Personally we think it's the best Indian in Cleveland.   Love it!?,1
PPCuGwbGA7HlhsGh8dbBsA,"My first Indian food experience and I really enjoyed it.  Now I really don't know how to judge Indian food so I brought along Mridul, from India but in US for work, to Taj for some good times, spicy cuisine, and some chilly beers.  I was really torn on my choice for the night, but between Taj and Cafe Tandoor, Taj won based on location and previous reviews.  Not to mention that this is close to my house so if the food was good, I could come here often.

We started off the night right with a beer that Mridul compered to Bud Light in the US, which is King Fisher in India.  The beer was good, little bite, but I could drink this stuff on a regular basis.  We opted for an appetizer to begin our feast.  We decided to go with the India Palace Special Platter - Combination of seekh kebab, chicken tikka, samosa and pakora.  Best way to sum this dish up was that I told him that this would be perfect for those hangover days where all you wanted was some deep fried goodness.  Everything but the lamb sausage and Chicken tikka was fried.  One of the items was an onion ball (not really a ball) that was delicious.  I enjoyed everything on the platter.

For dinner we decided to share a couple things just to see how authentic this place was.  The one item that Mridul kept talking about is Butter Chicken so that, for me, was a must have.  We also decided to go with the Dall Makni - Lentils cooked in butter with fresh onions, garlic, ginger and tomatoes, then topped with coriander.  Both dishes were accompanied by garlic naan, onion naan, and puri roti - Deep fried puffed light bread, all 3 breads we had to pay for but everything came with a plate full of nicely cooked white rice which cut the heat of the dishes really well.

I will tell you that, in my opinion, the butter chicken was delicious, I absolutely loved it.  The makni was spicy, but also really good, I will tone it down next time I get it because it did go perfectly with both of the naans as did the butter chicken.  I couldn't decide which naan I liked more so do yourself a favor and get both, you'll eat it.  My least favorite was the roti, but by least favorite I mean it was good but I figured I needed to pick out one dish that I didn't absolutely love.  Then again the wife loved it.  She said it reminded her of an elephant ear from the carnival minus the sugar and cinnamon, I agreed.  Guess you could consider that our desert because we were stuffed and couldn't eat another thing.

So we all sat around and talked about the authenticity of Taj.  While I had nothing to go on or compare to, I really just asked the questions where Mridul answered.  Some highlights are this.  When asked how it compared to, on a scale of 1-5, food in India, he gave it a 3 but if he was comparing it to US options, specifically Cleveland, even more specific - Indian Palace, he said it gets a solid 4.   He did enjoy the lentil dish more at Indian Palace in Lakewood but the butter chicken has his vote here at Taj.  He said the naan was spot on, the tandoor chicken was seasoned great, and that the only thing that the restaurant didn't do traditionally was to serve the plates warm.  Taj did offer water with no ice which was the first thing that he noticed and complimented.  That kind of started out the night on a good note.

The restaurant itself is relatively small but each table is given enough leg room and buffer where you can feel free to converse / frolic about yourself without the thread of eavesdroppers.  There is a smell to the place that does stay with you for a while but when you use bold ingredients like the Indian do, I 100% expected it.  The service was great, prices seemed reasonable, and clientele were 75% Indian and 25% other on a late Friday night. 

So overall I guess you could say that we really did enjoy the dinner at Taj India Palace and I will be back, if not just to get some things to go.  If you haven't been in, give it a shot, but keep in mind that not all Indian food will satisfy.  We were lucky to have a tour guide as Mridul noted probably 7-10 dishes that we would not like and it was really an acquired taste.  My recommendation, play it safe.  Medium-Hot is a good spice level, don't over do it or else it will light your insides on fire.  I am proud to say I am a big fan of Indian food.",1
PPCuGwbGA7HlhsGh8dbBsA,"My wife and I visit here at least several times a month for the buffet...we were here on Saturday February 3, 2018, and again enjoyed every bit of our food. The taste and spice level are always consistent....the spice level is generally in the mild range, with some entrees occasionally medium, but still not too hot.  The dosa's are always a nice addition with the meal.  We are vegetarian, and the majority of the entrees on the buffet are plant based....there is also a selection of chicken and goat for those wanting meat....we generally come on Saturdays or Sundays, and the entrees are never completely the same; at least several are different.  The same goes for weekdays, which we have visited more than a few times....Some of the mainstays are Dal, chickpeas, pakoras, veggie pancakes, basmatti rice ( although there are generally 2 additional rice dishes), saag paneer, naan, tandori chicken , chicken masala, goat curry, and rice pudding. (I'm sure i missed 1 or 2)... The employees are always friendly, and accommodating.  If you enjoy delicious, authentic Indian cuisine, give them a try!!",1
PPCuGwbGA7HlhsGh8dbBsA,"I went here this past Sunday. I was having some outpatient surgery Monday and only wanted one meal and wanted to be full. Kind of like a last supper deal. So for 11 dollars I went to the can you eat all buffet. Note - what ever you where in there will smell like Indian food for the rest of the day! I started out with some daal soup and and spicy vegetable soup. (Not that spicy for me nothing was super spicy.) Both the soups were well balanced and very tasty. Great for dipping naan in. Next the goat dish was decent. Lots of work, lots of bones to pick through, tasted like an Indian version of pot roast! The Butter Chicken was tasty and it was not overwhelming. There was also a vegetable and chicken rice dishes. Both good and fairly authentic. The Paneer was decent. There was a chickpea curry type of dish that was quite tasty also. There were some pea pancakes that where meh, probably good for mopping up sauce. Lastly some fried vegetable turd like nuggets. They were quite good, I'm thinking their base was of daal or chickpea, but tasted a little bit like falaffel. Quite nice I must say. I did not have room for anything else. 

On a side note there was a 50/50 Indian/Gringo customer average, so you can read into that however you want : ) The service was very efficient, I never had to ask for water, which is huge in my humble opinion. So if you have 13 bucks, its Sunday, want to eat a lot of Indian food, smell like Indian food, and feel stuffed from Indian food, this is your place.

PPCuGwbGA7HlhsGh8dbBsA,"First up, this restaurant is not even Indian. It is run by a Bangladeshi couple and the food is pretty much Bangladeshi. It is really unfortunate that some Bangladeshi and Pakistani restaurants  try to pass off as Indian - is it just so they can get more customers? I don't know but it is interesting. I have been to a few Pakistani restaurants and the food tastes pretty good. Why cant they just claim they're a Pakistani restaurant, people will still go there to eat.

Taj India Palace is just not good. I feel bad writing this. The food is stale sometimes, poor tasting, and sub-par at best. The Naans are a joke. I am well aware that Indian restaurants have a funky smell because of the spices but this place (although not Indian) takes that funky smell to another level!

If you really want to eat quality/authentic Indian food please try another place! The best place in the area in my opinion is: India Garden in Lakewood.

I really hope someday the Taj India Palace restaurant is re-named Taj Bangladeshi Palace. 

The only reason I would come back to this place is because the owner seems like a nice chap. He is polite and I like supporting such people even if their product is not up to snuff.",0
PPCuGwbGA7HlhsGh8dbBsA,"We went on one of the Friday night and ordered several dishes. For me as meat lover, I ordered the mixed grill. My wife ordered the palak paneer and dal. It's ok Indian food for me as I experienced more authentic Indian food in Asia. They seem like holding back on the seasonings. I am not sure if demographic taste preferences. The flavoring is a little too mild for my taste. 

The vegetarian sampler appetizer was a little too homogeneous. I don't think we got the variety as stated in the menu. The samosas were good but  not memorable. The naan bread with raisin and coconut was very good.

Seems like only one waiter could speak English. The other didn't really speak to us. The service is great and decent food, My heart still goes to the Indian take out on Mayfield road which is more well prepared and more authentic Southern Indian food. 

I have tasted better Indian food and food seasoned Indian way.",0
PPCuGwbGA7HlhsGh8dbBsA,If you are new to Indian food I would recommend Taj India Palace for an authentic experience and menu. The Indian Palace Special Platter is a great way to sample a few different popular Indian dishes. If you are not a fan of spice be sure to mention that at the time of ordering so that they can accommodate for you.,1

PubwGsZPO2N7QBekieMe9w,"Food was really good. Being from Texas where you get the best Mexican food anywhere, this place was very close! I had a clue when they brought a really fresh and authentic salsa. Very good. Had the cheese enchiladas with beans and rice. Everything was excellent! And I consider myself an expert when it comes to Mexican food.",1

Large, clean, and bustling.

It's right around the corner from us, so we come semi-regularly.  Service has always been solid.

The menu is huge.  You can stick to ""typical"" Mexican restaurant combo plates, or you can venture into more authentic options and things you won't find elsewhere.  Such as their Chicken Soup, which was awesome with tons of white chicken in a bowl large enough to fillup Fred Flintstone.

The most authentic?  Assuredly not.  Good food, served fast, hot, and tasty?   Yes indeed.",1

Would definitely recommend for a quick, cheap, lunchtime bite!",1
pUSXdML1e4ThKmiqa1Wvmw,"New-ish ownership! 

The bad news: The Monday night $5 burger-beer special is gone. 

The good news: The food is better! 

But I'm still torn. 

Bad news: I miss the authentic homeyness of TavCo days gone by. 

Good news: The service no longer sucks! (In fact, it's really good).

So what's my problem, right? Am I just a nostalgic bar mollusk? I don't know. My one real complaint is that the bathrooms still look like dive bar bathrooms. If they'd just take all that money they are making on their new $9 burger-beer special (!!!) and put it into a new bathroom, I might be sold for life.

Or better yet, if they'd just lower their prices a little bit, this mollusk might just attach to a new hull.

Anyway, the new TavCo is definitely worth a try.",0
pW-fOxuaWBkIhum5NANx2w,"Mike C. is right!   This place has good authentic Taiwanese food.

I went for the Jia-jiang Mein--  good stuff.   Thick white noodles with ground pork and a soybean paste.  Spicy.  Good.

Large dining space.  Nice peeps.  Super value.

the only lingering question is...   how will i feel in the morning?...

Update:   minimal diarrhea!   great success!!",1
pW-fOxuaWBkIhum5NANx2w,"Do not be alarmed when you walk in and see patrons eating with knives and forks.

I have to admit that I was a little skeptical at first, but because of strong and highly reputable word of mouth recommendations, I headed to China Sea Express to try out their secret menu Taiwanese food.

I was saddened when Garden Cafe (a small Taiwanese restaurant) closed because of the hole that it left for good beef noodle soup (""niu rou mien""). Beef noodle soup in Cleveland is BACK. 

We came on a Saturday evening right before a performance at Playhouse Square so it was a little busy. However, we were promptly seated. The waitress redirected us to the owner for our special off-menu order. 

My bf and I both had beef noodle soup ($6.95) -- ""hong sao niu rou mien"". The beef noodle soup broth was sooo good... very flavorful and authentic! I could distinctly taste that carrots had been stewing in the broth for many hours. The noodles and the beef (says the bf) were pretty decent, though not mindblowing. I'd definitely recommend the dish just for the broth though!

Since he has a good eye, he spotted the platter of handmade dumplings on the table behind us. Apparently they make beef and pork dumplings by hand. We ordered some dumplings ($6.95) and they had pretty good flavor and thick dumpling skin. Not the highest presentation points as it was clearly handmade, but we definitely thought they were pretty good.

The owner and his wife came over and chatted with us for a while. They are Taiwanese, and while they are very fluent English speakers, speaking in Mandarin with them definitely helped us connect better. I'd give this place an extra half star because of how hospitable they were to us. They told us that they don't put MSG in their food (at least off-menu?) because it's what they like to eat themselves. Huge plus.

I would love to go back. My next question for them is... do they have tomato beef noodle soup? (fan qie niu rou mien?) If they do... game over. drool.",1
pW-fOxuaWBkIhum5NANx2w,"OK, here's a secret.  You know how in some Chinese restaurants there is the ""regular menu"" and the secret ""Chinese menu"" for people who, you know, speak Chinese?  The secret to getting great food at this little hole in the wall restaurant is talking to the wait staff or owner and asking to try some food from the Chinese menu.  At a friend's (who has far more distinguished taste than myself) recommendation, a friend and I tried this place for dinner last night.  They have really authentic Taiwanese food.  The things that I tried were some homestyle classics- ask for ""Ma po dofu"" (a spicy, hearty tofu and pork stew'ish thing) or ""neeo-ro-mien"" a hearty beef noodle soup.  Prices are good for this level of authentic food.  Only place I know in the Cleveland area to get authentic Taiwanese food.  I also hear their ""Jia-Jiang Mien"" is good (a dry noodle in a savory brown sauce dish).

Skip the buffet- ask the waiter for recommendations on the Taiwanese food from the Chinese menu.  They are eager to please and to show the world what authentic Taiwanese food tastes like.  Then see if you really think this place is a one or two star place.  

I'm not sure why the other three good reviews have been voted down.",1
pW-fOxuaWBkIhum5NANx2w,"I'm giving China Sea Express only two stars, but I do go here quite frequently.  Why?  The food is perfectly adequate and it's only $6 for the buffet - it's a bargain! Keep that in mind as you read.

I work less than five minutes from here, so it's convenient, and I have to admit that when I think about paying $7 for a sandwich or a salad at a nearby shop, or paying $6 for the buffet, my frugality often leads me back to the trough.

The place is clean and the staff is attentive, and the lunch crowd keeps it busy.  There's a real mix of business people and students from CSU.  It's also heartening to see that a lot of the Asian students go here for lunch, although they rarely seem to order the buffet, and I'm not really surprised, because I don't think it really even approximates authentic Chinese cuisine.

There are a few items I favor: the curry chicken skewers, the General Tso's chicken; the peanut butter chicken and the green beans with black bean sauce are my usual fare.  I try to limit myself to two plates, but sometimes I go back for a third, and I'm rarely glad I did.

The peanut butter chicken is something that is unique to my Cleveland Chinese food experience.  I have seen it at other restaurants, but never in California or anywhere else I have gone.  It's creamy and a little sweet, but very tasty and has to be hell on your arteries.

I don't really care for the Cleveland style sweet and sour chicken either, which is merely strips of chicken that have been battered and deep friend - almost like fish.  You take as many of these as you want and then just ladle that sweet red glaze over them.  That's not the kind of sweet and sour I grew up with, and it doesn't appeal to me.

I find their eggrolls a bit bland, as well as their vegetable low mien.  I avoid the pork stuff and anything with shrimp, so I can't comment on their taste, but they look perfectly, generically acceptable for Chinese buffet fare.

I always want it to be better, but it is certainly reliable in its mediocrity, and I will continue to frequent the place, as long as I'm working in the vicinity.",1
pW-fOxuaWBkIhum5NANx2w,"Being raised in Taiwan, I was so excited to try China Sea Express after hearing all the great recommendations from my Taiwanese friends and about how the owner and his wife is from Taiwan. That being said... i will more than likely come back to this place again to give it a shot, but for now, i'd say it's not my top 5 favorite restaurant in town quite yet. 

Also, don't be fooled by the storefront and the name. This place is more authentic than the name gives it and it's wayyyy bigger than it looks from the outside. give it a shot!

Beef Noodle Soup (3.8): This is the first time I've had beef noodle soup (niu ro mien) in Cleveland so it's hard to compare. I'd say it's pretty authentic to what I would've expected. The good news is... I have to applaud China Sea Express for using authentic beef noodle soup noodles- that's pretty rare to find in Cleveland (specially after all those failed 'ramen' restaurants in CLE). That really excited me. The beef is pretty authentic too with a good portion. The only thing was that the broth was a bit too much on the sweet side so if they could improve on the broth, it would be a pretty decent dish!

Steam & Fried Dumplings (4): my favorite part of the meal was their dumplings. It's homemade and although the dumplings are really small (I can probably eat 30 of their dumplings), the flavors and the skin is good!!! I recommend the pork & cabbage FRIED dumpling. 

Mapo Tofu (3): This was recommended by the owner and it was a bit better than i expected. The only issue (common issue at this restaurant) is that all i taste is the spice and the sweetness of the dish. I was expecting more salt + spice, not sugar + spice.

Green Beans + Pork (3): This dish does remind me of home since my mom cooks it alot. The saltiness flavor was there (yay) but it wasn't authentic. 

HOWEVER, after trying their green beans + pork dish, i'm very very curious about their jia-jiang mien. only because the pork sauce they used in the green beans dish tastes like jia-jiang mien sauce. 

China Sea Express, I'll be back.",1

qbDaSyxDfUZNheucJym2Pg,Go there and ask for the Chinese menu - in the back of some of their menus. Order whatever sounds tasty to you. You will like it. They have some of the best authentic Chinese food I've had in Cleveland. I have no idea why they don't advertise it more. A gem if you know what to order!,1
qbDaSyxDfUZNheucJym2Pg,"From the outside you'd think its a generic type of an American style Chinese food.  A fews ago I'd say this is true.  Now it has new life.  Yes there is the Americanized style Chinese food, good but not great but with a chef who worked for Li Wah downtown there is now traditional Style southern Chinese food on the East Side.  Finally

Basically like most Asian food places, you'll have to ask for off menu items.  The OTHER menu has whole lot of other dishes from steamed/pan seared fishes, Hong Kong Style wonton noodle soups to Moi Choi Kow Yuk ""mandarine: Mei Cai Kao Rou"" ( Triple layed pork over chinese mustard greens.) You can also request for special items if you know what you want.    

There are other authentic Chinese places on the Eastside but this one is the only southern style place.

Personally I like this place for Chinese food on the Eastside.  Being Asian American, I guess I am more prone to Asian flavors...no brainer right? =)  Seriously go here and order the traditional Chinese food.",1

qHiaNXS_F1M8aEa7YfoqCw,"Proper, authentic Caribbean food in Cleveland? Yes, please! This place is a little hard to spot from the road due to not being very large and the sign not being very clear, but once you get past that and the more worn-down feel of the neighborhood around it, it's worth a trip. I got the jerk chicken, the chicken soup, and a bottle of Ting (which I haven't had since a trip to Antigua), and the food was perfectly seasoned and delicious. There was a fair amount of bone in the chicken, but the meat was tender and practically falling off, so that wasn't a problem. I'd suggest getting some additional sauce to put on the rice, though - my friend got the goat curry, and the sauce from that seemed to improve the rice.

I will say that they were out of some of their menu items (no other soups remaining, for example), but I'm not sure if that's due to those items being very popular or them just understocking for the day. One further caveat is that there's only one table (mostly because there's only space for one table), so this isn't an eat-in place.",1

QQqI1z1FohJGSLV0qKvOjQ,"I love this place.  I have visited this restaurant since it's started the service.  I should write this review long time ago but I didn't do it because I am Thai and I am just afraid that people will think that I get any benefit from this review.

Tree country bistro always welcome me and my friends as a family.  I always take my friends and visitors to dine here because they have mix types of Asian food.  It is located in a convenient area,easy to find parking and it is so closed to CWRU.  the price is affordable and as I mention earlier, they serve Korean/Thai/Japanese food which is good for a group of friends.

What I like about this place - I like the stability of the taste of the food and the friendly service.  Every restaurant has its low-high point.  I found that they try to keep their standard.  They provide warm welcome tea.  The server is friendly and attentive.   The taste of their food is quite stable when compare to the other restaurants.  Their dish might not completely standing out but never gave me disappointment.   I like their noodle - both PadThai and crazy noodle.   their noodle is soft and tender but it is not overcooked like the other restaurant.  It is difficult to fry a noodle and get soft and tenderness in the same time.   I saw a couple of people complain about the greasy but I don't feel that way.  First of all,  Asian food is relatively more greasy when compare to Western food.  I truly think that their food is very authentic taste and I really think their Padthai is the best Padthai in this area.  Most of Padthai I got from the other restaurants are overcooked.  If you know how to cook, you will appreciate how hard it is to cook fried rice and get a beautiful shinny grain of rice.

All of my friends and visitors love their food.  we will definitely back.",1

Food: 5/5; fantastic!

Best Thai place I've been to. It' a mix of Korean/Thai/Japanese but I come here especially for their thai food - the pad thai might be the best in Cleveland. Can't stop ordering their Indonesian Fried Rice - the combo of the rice with the fried egg and fried chicken with that amazing dipping sauce! It's delicious! I know their other entrees are great as well. I don't like chicken satay but my boyfriend loves it so we tried it here and I fell in love... 

Their sushi rolls are made right at the sushi bar - I love the Spider Maki! (though I'm no expert - not a big fan of raw fish). 

We've have the fried bananas and ice cream (don't know what the actual dessert is) because they usually surprise us with a treat after our meals. Of course they get brownie points for that! I cannot get enough of this place. 

I've never had takeout here, but I would highly recommend a dining in once before you judge their food. I've had my fair share of asian food - both Americanized and authentic - and this is definitely one of the best.",1
QQqI1z1FohJGSLV0qKvOjQ,"Coventry is a treasure trove of delicious Asian foods as well as unique one of a kind restaurants. Tree Country is no exception to this, containing a very diverse menu consisting of Thai, Vietnamese, Japanese, and a small spattering of Korean food. I've been to this restaurant multiple times and I have always enjoyed their food. One of my favorite things to get is their Indonesian fried rice. While not anything like authentic nasi goreng, the Tree Country chefs put their own spin on Indonesian fried rice and it still tastes good. The kimchi fried rice is also good, though again not quite what I would expect from a Korean restaurant. Their sushi is pretty good, and there is debate among my friends what sushi is better between Tree Country and Pacific East down the street.

Admittedly, Tree Country dabbles in a wide variety of Asian cuisines, and many of them do not taste quite as ""authentic"" as I might expect. However, the quality of the food is always consistent, and it's a good place to go for a meal.",1
QQqI1z1FohJGSLV0qKvOjQ,"3.5 stars for now until I try more. Now that Mint Cafe is gone, my roommate and I have been searching for our default ""Asian comfort food"" restaurant. (After large projects and conferences, we usually eat pad thai together.)

Good thing Tree Country Bistro is just across the street! We both ordered pad thai. I ordered Country Style Pad Thai and asked for it to be ""authentically spiced."" I still thought it was fairly mild but it was pretty delicious anyway.

The service was great; the waitresses checked on us fairly regularly and kept refilling our waters. 

The rest of the menu is overwhelming with the # of options, but I can't wait to try it all. I'm still hesitant to lift my Cleveland sushi boycott (holding out until I go to the coasts) but I wouldn't mind giving Tree Country a try.

The food is bland, the sauce is watery, the vegetables are overcooked, and nothing is particularly authentic. I think if you want Japanese food, you'd be better off going to a Japanese restaurant.

Most of the time, Thai food I get at restaurants that are not made to specialize in just Thai food is greasy and just oily and salty. This was also full of heavy sauce, and not particularly strong flavor from spices and fresh ingredients.

Portion and price-wise, it's a solid choice! But no where near great Asian food.",0
QQqI1z1FohJGSLV0qKvOjQ,"I would categorize this place as ""servicable"".  It's not going to blow your mind with authentic flavors and off-the-hook food, but its good when you need your fix and other places aren't available.  

I had the fresh rolls and some chicken pad thai.  The rolls were pretty good--certainly fresh, and came with an interesting dipping sauce.  However, the pad thai was sort of a bummer.  There's hardly any vegetables in their mixture, and the chicken was really...chewy.  Even though it arrived piping hot, the chicken was kinda tough.  Sauce was pretty standard in terms of flavor but the ratio was off in terms of amount applied to noodles.  More sauce might have helped with the chicken texture, too.  

I agree with other reviewers that this place suffers from a bit of an identity crisis--with korean, thai, and ""pan-asian"" offerings from one place, they're bound to be done less-well than a place with more of a focus.",0
QRSmjSpB6Yn5iNS6q88tNg,"BEST sushi in the area, great price. I am Asian and eating sushi is my normal diet. 

Tried Sushi Rock, Pacific East, and other sushi places around. 

This is the ONLY place that made REAL authenticated sushi with reasonable price. 

They have FREE parking on the back too, I mean FREE parking in downtown Cleveland, can't beat that. 

However, space is very limited. 
Dining room decoration is OK, service is OK. 

Sometimes they are busy and shorthanded, so be expected to wait a little longer.
Liked: Food, Service, Atmosphere, Value, Sushi, Fish",1
QRSmjSpB6Yn5iNS6q88tNg,"Definitely some of the best I have had in Cleveland!  Let's be honest, Cleveland is not the sushi capital of the world, but I would take Ginza's authentic, tasty sushi over Parallax's fushion-y, overpriced mediocre sushi any day.  

The prices at Ginza are reasonable, and their menu covers the gamut of all your basic sushi/ sashimi/ chiashi/ etc. to all the other basic Japanese dishes you'd expect.  They also have tatami mat seating too, if youre so inclined.  I've been here for lunch with large groups (get the sushi boat!) and for dinner .  They don't have a full bar, but they do have wine and sake!

It makes me sad that this place isn't so well known . . . perhaps because it is a little off the beaten path.  Definitely head here for decent Japanese food!",1
QUjJmpTQvGus8WfYq1dtOw,"To start let me give you one piece of advise. DO NOT make plans after dinner, expect to be there for a while. In true southern fashion, things move a bit slower here. Not out of negligance, but relaxation. With this said, the food here is fantastic! Junior runs a one man show and is more than happy to share a few words with you. The place seats maybe 25 and is very ""family oriented"" I would grade it a 5 if it wasn't so expensive and had a bit more elbow room. (50$ with an app and two entrees) But in terms of taste and authenticity, this place is spot on.",1
QUjJmpTQvGus8WfYq1dtOw,Went for my first time today. Cajun perch dinner and seafood gumbo was authentic. The owner was the kindest person I've met. Everything was delicious! Will be back very soon!,1
QUjJmpTQvGus8WfYq1dtOw,"Best fried pickles I've ever had.  Best fried catfish I've ever had. The food is salty and spicy, which some people don't like apparently. I happen to love it. My dad was eating his remoulade sauce for the fried pickles out of the bowl with his fork, if that tells you anything - I guess mostly that my dad needs some better manners ;) 
The owner runs the whole thing - takes your order, helps cook the food (there is one woman in the back who did most of the cooking it seemed), buses your table.  And most importantly, he will chat you up in a non-annoying way. It just feels so authentic. You feel like he values your presence in his restaurant, he wants to learn about you, and he wants you to enjoy your food and drink.
My parents are visiting from out of town and he wrote down directions to places he thought they would enjoy.
Don't expect to be in and out of this place in a hurry.  Everything is deliberately prepared and it takes a while. The prices were a little higher than I was expecting, too.  But I think it is worth it for the experience and the taste.",1
QUjJmpTQvGus8WfYq1dtOw,"I don't do a lot of 5 stars, but this is the real deal.  Straight out of Nawlins, Junior Battiste is careful that every visitor gets a taste of both authentic Cajun cuisine and the hospitality of the culture.  What a guy.

This is real ÁE©touffÁE©e, real gumbo, real jambalaya.  You'll know the difference in first bite.  Ask him one too many questions and he'll be sure to explain the difference between light and dark roux, give you samples to taste, and talk about his favorite flavors.  He just loves food. Period.

The quaintness of the place just sets it off. It's awkward. It's cramped. But that's why you'll be back.  Because instead of feeling like a cafeteria it feels like a dimly lit living room with smells wafting from the adjacent kitchen.  For you New Yorkers - you know this setting is special.

He best Cajun outside of N.O.  Guaranteed.",1
QUjJmpTQvGus8WfYq1dtOw,Every time I walk through the doors I feel like I am stepping back onto the streets of NOLA. The food and the atmosphere are authentic and that is the best compliment I gave give Junior and his place.,1
QUjJmpTQvGus8WfYq1dtOw,"Probably the only place in the CLE area to get truly authentic Louisiana Cuisine. You know it's legit when you call to place a take out order and the thick Cajun accent greets you. There is a reason this place racked up the wins at the Taste of Cleveland food festival year after year. It is crazy good. Literally the best jambalaya ever. You won't find a gumbo like theirs because it's the real deal, not the bagged mass-produced stuff you get at other places. 

The best part? It's in my neighborhood. South Euclid should be proud to claim this gem.",1
QUjJmpTQvGus8WfYq1dtOw,"Junior is the Man! He's from New Orleans and makes the best gumbo I've ever had. He treats everyone like a friend and guest in his house. An incredible man with incredible food and stories. A true hidden gem on the east side if you like that authentic New Orleans feel and food. Whether you  just wanna drink from a guy that makes you feel like family or the food that he creates, Junior is a special guy with special talents. He brings the south to NE Ohio, no doubt!",1
QvKN1zh_BCFai6oDCx3d_g,"I will say this is the best Chinese food in the west park area I have had so far. The prices are fair and the food was good. The kung po chicken  was good but not really spicy at all next time I will ask for extra spicy. The hunan beef was good and had more kick to it than the kung po. We did get a order of 3 crab ragoon from the website as they have free food and drinks when you spend a certain dollar amount but they did not include any sweet and sour sauce with not sure if they just forgot or if it's not included with the free order. The sauce is what I expected tasty but had quite a bit oil mixed into to create it.  The delivery time took close to an hour after we submitted our order. So if you are looking for your non authentic Chinese food fix the you will enjoy this place as I did.

Had the food gotten to us faster and they included sweet and sour sauce would have given 4 stars.",0
QXpNsm8A8G86Vu5ECo1MgA,"I love this place. It's a hidden gem near West Side Market. I usually get a cappuccino (authentic) and a sea salt chocolate chip cookie. I think the staff can't stop eating them, which is why they're not in stock sometimes. I can't blame them.

I'd rate this as one of the top, if not the best, coffee spots in Cleveland. Support your local businesses and check these guys out.",1

QYio9HySny2cMcIs8YjMCQ,"Everything is amazing! Very authentic! The staff is super friendly. I will walk the extra distance just to go there. I even buy food to bring home with me so I can enjoy takeout throughout the week. I have tried the salads, wraps, and platters and love it all!",1
QYio9HySny2cMcIs8YjMCQ,"I should've read the reviews first and noticed that all the reviewers are not originally Lebanese people. If you are Lebanese or Syrian this not the place to go to.

qZZ8VU1Bk-xCruEAZNwm6A,"Love Sainato's authentic Italian pizza and calzones...have been eating them since Louie was in Slavic Village. We really love the sauce, and I'm glad that he is selling jars now.",1
qZZ8VU1Bk-xCruEAZNwm6A,"Even though it was delivery, it was a very Italian experience. From the person who took my order to the marinated olives I had as an appetizer, you can tell this place has some authenticity. 5 of 5 for being a great delivery option; prompt delivery, hot food, good food, and courteous staff. I hope I get the opportunity to visit in person! 

I had the assorted olives as an appetizer, a small side salad w/poppyseed dressing, and the vegetable lasagna for an entree. The salad was a typical garden salad, but was very fresh. The dressing was also very good. My lasagna was awesome. All food arrived hot (salad was cold & crisp), and although I finished up some work and allowed the food to cool down before eating, it was still very good.",1
r6o9Fi0rHCB3f1mEGdL61A,"Sandwiches nowadays are too trivialized. You stand in some franchise sandwich shop like Subway and you know that nothing out of the ordinary will happen - you forsee that some thinned out ham or roastbeef  soon will be slapped on your generic Italian bread drowned in a dressing from a jar. Blah. Let's dream big kids. 
How about authentic intriguing combination of ingredients making your palate and mind wonder about what else is out there? Outside the globe of America? Goat cheese? Pesto?  Gouda? Amazing breads with names that are hard to pronounce? Why not. This little sandwich shop gives you the opportunity to expand the horizons in a very tasty way. All house choices are very good, trust me. Please don't play God creating your own sandwich. Sandwiches like these are like good  movies - you don't go in a movie theater with a script you prepared at home expecting it to be played to you. You come to be amused.  So you might just as well let this sandwich shop surprise  and entertain you. Cheaper than airfare to Europe and  you won't ask for your money back.",1
r6X4klJJdeta0gqTYa-DgQ,"Love this place.  Came with a friend and the service was outstanding. We met the owner, Will....can't believe how great he treated us.

RbrZJEf8TlnP7RHaKnCtIQ,"One day after I satisfy my frozen yogurt craving at Kiwispoon... I get invited out to eat frozen yogurt at Piccadilly.  A rare opportunity to truly compare the two yogurt places.

Here, I tried three flavors - chocolate, pumpkin, and caramel sea salt.  Added toppings of brownie bits, chocolate caramel turtles, and mochi.

Overall, I liked the yogurt better at Kiwispoon. The frozen yogurt seems less rich in Piccadilly's and the flavors are not as strong.  The price per ounce is also marginally higher at Piccadilly's.

There are definitely pluses to Piccadilly's yogurt though.  I liked the toppings better - I thought the mochi tasted better, the brownie pieces were bigger, and the chocolate caramel turtles went great on ice cream.  The chocolate caramel turtles should be a standard topping for both frozen yogurt and ice cream places.  Also, with the huge map of Cleveland Heights behind the cash register, this feels more like an authentic ""neighborhood"" froyo joint.",1
rgBfJFvuuSURBnanLeLVfg,"When we walked in, we were greeted by the owner and the most humble server I've ever met. The place is well designed, clean and had the right Ethiopian vibe with a modern touch. It's also very spacious. We were given the menus promptly and our server came back shortly to check. He took our order and even offered juice for our toddler... Excellent service.

The food was great. Most importantly, it was authentic. We started with the Sambusa appetizer followed by the Beef Combination and Quanta Firfir. The Sambusas were made to order and came out crispy and hot. The combination was plenty and delicious! The Quanta was one of the best we've ever had.

The owners including the chef came to check on us regularly and offered anything to make the meal more enjoyable. They even asked for feedback.

Definitely coming back again!",1
rgBfJFvuuSURBnanLeLVfg,"Delicious.  We were the first of the dinner crowd on a Saturday night.  We ordered the chicken combo and a lamb dish..  We also scored a couple sambusas.  I'm not a good judge of spice, but to me the meal was quite mild but very flavorful. The service was very good.  She was very pleasant and offered to explain things if we had questions.  No the food did not come out fast, but certainly not slow.  If you want to walk up, order and have mediocre good slopped out in a few minutes I would say try the olive garden.  For delicious authentic food that may take a bit, but will be worth the wait check this place out. I hear they have big things planned for music and a buffet,  I'll definitely be back to check that out.",1

rgsKBjXJbiXPaRHc3mY2hw,"I stopped by today around 7pm. The time listed on yelp was 5-10pm so I thought maybe they're a dinner only place. Later that night I was informed that their hours are 10am to 6pm!!! The service was fantastic! The people are really nice and accommodating. They served me even though they were closed and their food is fantastic! I had the cheddar and potato pierogies and bacon, cheddar and potatos. I love the bacon on better. They added onions and sour cream! So delicious! I also had the stuffed cabbage. I had two kinds -- one with the saurkraut and the other with tomato sauce. Both were sooo good!! I like the one with saurkraut better. I finished them both. Lastly is the pastry. It is this pastry with homemade whipped cream. I mean, what isn't  homemade here? I see they are hard at work in the back actually making pierogies! This is the real authentic stuff. Definitely a great gem here in Cleveland!",1
rnvKg9DtsAIHWU4eywsqmA,Awesome bbq. Get there early... the brisket sells out quickly. Very reasonable and authentic.,1
rnvKg9DtsAIHWU4eywsqmA,"First visit and definitely not my last!!  Amazing BBQ with authentic sides and great portions!!  Today I ordered the two meat with two side,  expecting to get small sample size portions like everywhere e kg se.  Not so here!!!!  

Great size enter portions of Pulled pork and melt in your mouth Brisket.  I ordered the baked beans and mac and cheese with cornbread on the side.  I would have added pics but,  I already done so deep into this meal that their current state would not do justice.  Everything was perfectly flavored (in my opinion),  the two sauces I tried on the side were great! I will be back for sure and I regret that u put off visiting here for so long.  

Easy to get to location, very friendly cashier who answered my questions with a smile and to the guy who I assume was the manager or owner who talked to me before I left and made sure to let me know that they are serving Smoked Corner Beef all day this Saturday for St. Patrick's Day!!!

rnvKg9DtsAIHWU4eywsqmA,"First of all, the staff was SO pleasant and helpful which is always refreshing. I was a little wary at first due to its ""hole in the wall"" appearance, but wow am I glad I gave it a chance! I got the brisket hash- Hands down best brisket I've ever had! I tried the Mac and cheese which was authentic and awesome as well. The sauces were amazing but not even necessary- there's already so much flavor going on. The only thing I'm disappointed about is the fact that I am leaving Cleveland today and will not have a chance to come back for dinner. Within my four day stay I've visited several restaurants and this place is hands down the best (and cheapest) place I've been! 10/10 would recommend ;)",1
RpMp700t8ON-2AvAAcohxA,"Yes, finally some Asian desserts in Cleveland! The bubble waffles are not bad, not quite as soft and fluffy as the ones in Hong Kong but better than most other places in the States. The real star here that everyone should get are the egg tarts. The crust is buttery and the custard filling is velvety and delicious. I can see these are some of the best egg tarts I've had. If they don't have a batch of tarts ready, you have to wait 30mins for them to make it fresh, but it is completely worth it. The tarts taste extra delicious piping hot! Another noteworthy mention is the Hong Kong milk tea. It's flavor is a lot stronger than other places and is very authentic.",1
RpMp700t8ON-2AvAAcohxA,"We're a regular here! Not only are the waffles great, but so are their egg tarts (my personal fave), teas, and egg rolls! Someone mentioned that their milk teas have a weird taste to them- thats what authentic HK teas are supposed to taste like :) it may be ""weird"" at first but you grow to love it! Also, i brought some of their egg tarts to a house warming party and even the older guests who aren't fond of sweets totally finished these egg tarts and asked where i got them from. 
What makes this place so great are the owners: so friendly and caring. They're dedicated to bring the authentic, tasty hong kong pastries, they're constantly experimenting and creating new menus to try. They even spontaneously made us a traditional HK cold remedy drink because we told them we had the flu: hot coca cola with ginger and lemon. The warmth and the deliciousness of their drinks and pastries are the results of the effort, the time, the care they put into them.",1
RpMp700t8ON-2AvAAcohxA,"If you want to try authentic Hong Kongese type street food, this is the place you go. Highly recommended. This is the best you can have in Cleveland. Their level is comparable to LA and SF.",1
RpMp700t8ON-2AvAAcohxA,"Last time I was in Cleveland, the only place I could get the Hong Kong style egg waffle was at Mason's Creamery in the Tremont area. Since then, Cleveland has diversified its Asian food options, and Asia Plaza has opened up a place that serves this signature Hong Kong dessert.

I came here with several of my Cleveland friends, as well as my fiance. It has a very nice ambience. There are a variety of ways to customize your egg waffle, as far as what you can put inside the egg waffle and also what you can put on top of it (e.g. ice cream). Additionally, Ball Ball Waffle also has the option of ordering Hong Kong style lemon iced tea as well as Hong Kong style milk tea. I ended up getting a Hong Kong style lemon iced tea and a matcha mochi egg waffle.

The Hong Kong style lemon iced tea tastes exactly like what I would have at Kee Wah or a Hong Kong cafe in the San Gabriel Valley. I did ask for half sugar, which I think helped, as I don't like my drinks too sweet. The matcha mochi egg waffle was made to order, and the addition of matcha on the outside and mochi on the inside made it a super tasty dessert. The condensed milk drizzle also added to the Hong Kongness of the treat.

An amazing addition to Asiatown plaza, and another option to get this classic Hong Kong style dessert that has been heavily modified and diversified in the past few decades. Highly recommended to anyone who wants to try authentic Hong Kong style dessert.",1
RpMp700t8ON-2AvAAcohxA,"A solid addition to the Asiatown plaza! It's right between Li Wah and Park to Shop, so a great place for dessert after dimsum/grocery shopping. There's also plenty of free parking nearby. 

I thought the flavors were pretty authentic to HK street food. The waffle was airy, light, and not overly sweet. The iced coffee was also one of the closest to what I've tasted in Hong Kong. I liked how everything is made to order so all the food is fresh. However, the restaurant is pretty small so it can easily get crowded and loud. Definitely not good for big parties unless you have another place to eat. Also, I thought the prices were a little on the high side.",1
RpMp700t8ON-2AvAAcohxA,"We had Hong Style Milk Tea and the Peanut butter waffle. It was really good! The milk tea was high quality, very authentic flavor! We loved what we ordered! I definitely recommend it if you want to treat yourself with some sweet!",1
RpMp700t8ON-2AvAAcohxA,"I like this place: it's a great little spot inside the plaza that houses Li Wah and Park to Shop. It is surrounded by windows and is an open kitchen, so you get to see everything that goes on. It's fun to watch the waffle gets made, as once the machine is finished cooking it they take a hair dryer to the waffle, which causes the bubbles to rise. 

 I stopped in a few minutes after opening, which is something I try not to do, but the owner greeted me warmly. I ordered the Hong Kong style waffle, which comes with peanut butter and condensed milk drizzled on top, and a milk tea. The waffle takes some time to make, I believe there was a sign that even tells customers to expect a 10 minute wait, but I got to drink my milk tea while I waited. The milk tea is creamy and strong, but not very sweet. To me, it's perfect, but if you like bubble tea or bottled milk tea you might be a little surprised. 


I've never had a bubble waffle before, so I can't really vouch for authenticity, but I really enjoyed it. Imagine a large waffle with a rich taste, enhanced with peanut buttery goodness. I think the peanut butter outweighs the condensed milk, but no complaints here.

All in all, I really enjoyed my first visit here and really want to come back to try more things. It really feels like a street stall with the small (but cozy) space and small menu. The place has a warm vibe to it and you can tell they really care about the food and their customers.",1
RpMp700t8ON-2AvAAcohxA,"We are from Toronto where there are a ton of these places around but this place makes the best one we've had since Stanley Park in Hong Kong. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, this legit. They've really taken the time to perfect how to make these! The tea is also top notch, well done and truly authentic HK style. This place won't disappoint. Great snack for both sweet, savoury and for tea lovers. Highly recommended!",1
rRTz0zVbjmrEY8dEZmPJTA,"A perfectly decent place for ramen if you're OK with the offerings having a strong Chinese influence, whether in the flavors or certain ingredients like the char siu. I'm of Cantonese descent myself and found my bowl of ramen to be quite satisfying because it had so many familiar, reassuring Chinese flavors. 

Although this place can be super busy, with a line almost stretching to the door at peak periods, things move along quite quickly. Even though there's only about a dozen tightly-packed seats inside, folks slurp down their bowls and generally don't linger any longer than they have to, so seats do turn over regularly. Service is fast and efficient.

It all might not be the most authentic ramen from a Japanese perspective, particularly if you've traveled and dined extensively in Japan. Some bowls like the #1 char siu bowl are slightly spendy too. I suspect, however, that there aren't many quality Asian establishments in this part of the city or in the greater metropolitan area, so Otani wins by default.",1
rRTz0zVbjmrEY8dEZmPJTA,"Excellent ramen! After a huge disappointment at a noodle place in Crocker Park a few days ago, my wife, son, and I were still craving a more authentic ramen. We headed to Otami and the Case area for an outing. My sister in-law and her boyfriend also went with us. All were very satisfied. The dishes were complex, well presented, and extremely tasty. The brothes and noodles were awesome. Between the five of us we got three number 1s with pork, a seafood ramen, and a shrimp tempura ramen. My pork ramen was great. My wife's seafood ramen had a lighter and equally tasty broth and my son's shrimp tempura was crispy and flavorful. The place was cozy and dishes were served in a nice big bowl.",1
rRTz0zVbjmrEY8dEZmPJTA,"You know there isn't that many ramen places to choose from so there isn't much of a competition.  When you first come in, you get s feel of authentic vibes.  They have high tops with stools to sit on.  You can possibly fit 4-6 people comfortably at each table.  

The workers all stand behind their work station, getting ready for anyone and everyone! The prices are averagely priced for a ramen and you get a nice portion for it.  

If you have some trouble deciding on what you would like, check out the pictures they provide on the wall!  They have one screen on there dedicated to showing pictures and a glimpse of the menu.  

The hubby, my friend, and I ordered the spicy ramen.  The spicy ramen wasn't really that spicy in my opinion, but they have chili oil at each table to add to your ramen.  The broth was pretty bland.  The noodles were cooked to perfection.  And the belly pork was so tender and juicy!!! I was very very pleased with the pork and would probably come back to try a different ramen with the belly pork!

Once we ordered, she asked if I was a case student and I said no.  But she asked because case students receive a 10% discount!! But you need to show your ID.  So don't try to fool them!

Overall, I'd bring anyone here with a ramen craving!",1
rRTz0zVbjmrEY8dEZmPJTA,"I'm not exactly an expert on authentic ramen, but yum!  We've ordered delivery from here a few times, and we've been impressed each time.  It's a little bit expensive, but the portions are generous and the quality is on point.  My husband pretty much always gets the Jigoku spicy ramen, so it must be good.  I'm partial to the torikatsu (chicken) as far as protein goes, but I've tried it with multiple broth options. This is the only place I've ever tried tonkatsu broth and I love it, but the shoyu and miso are pretty delicious too.  When you order ramen to-go or delivery, the broth is packaged separately from the ""stuff"" which helpfully prevents sogginess upon arrival.  The only appetizer we've tried was the edamame and they were pretty tasty.  It's kind of cool that you can get Ramune Japanese soda as well.

I plan to slowly make my way through the menu, and maybe eventually make myself venture from the noodle bowls to the rice bowls-- but it's hard to branch out when the soup is so good.  I still haven't actually been to the physical location so I can't tell you anything about atmosphere or service, but I can wholeheartedly recommend their ramen.",1
rRTz0zVbjmrEY8dEZmPJTA,"Broth was a bit lacking in flavor. Quality of ingredients was fine; however choice of ingredients was suspect compared to most authentic ramen shops. The food is really cheap, plus they offer student discounts. Service is quite fast but the shop can get quite packed when they start getting multiple orders.",0
rRTz0zVbjmrEY8dEZmPJTA,"I knew something was different the moment I saw curry fish balls on the menu at a ramen restaurant. The Cantonese music was another hint, and the Chinese beverages was another hint. When I was able to converse with all the staff in Cantonese, it dawned on me - this ramen restaurant is run exclusively by Chinese people.

Not to say that this fact in itself takes away from the quality of the food. The ramen is still pretty good, and the broth is solid. However, the flavor of the ramen itself does taste distinctly Cantonese. I ordered the miso ramen with char siu, and the ramen had more of a sesame oil flavor than a miso flavor. When I order miso ramen at places in LA and New York, the miso is very very strong, though the miso ramen at Otani tasted more like sesame instant noodles. Additionally, I felt a Cantonese influence in how light the broth was - I expect miso ramen broth to be heavier and thicker.

Some may question authenticity, but then what exactly does one call a Chinese take on a Japanese dish that has its roots in a Chinese dish (liamen)?

The answer: pretty good noodles! I would not rate this as highly as ramen places in major cities, who tend to spend days to prepare their homemade ramen broths, use the highest quality pork, and frequently make their own noodles. However, Otani is good if you're looking for a quick fix, and in many ways reminded me of the type of instant noodles that I can get at Hong Kong diners. Solid, filling, and fairly light.

I plan on coming back and trying their curry fish balls for sure. It's by no means a Japanese staple, but as a Cantonese person myself, I'm always looking for good quality curry fish balls.",0
rRTz0zVbjmrEY8dEZmPJTA,"It's really difficult to find an authentic Japanese place in Cleveland, but the ramen here is decent! Service is really good too!",1
rRTz0zVbjmrEY8dEZmPJTA,"if you been to the authentic ramen shops like Totto ramen in NYC, this is the closest to the authentic ramen taste that u can get here in Cleveland. i've been eating ramen from lots of places and finally theres 1 here near downtown cleveland. not disappointed at all.",1
rRTz0zVbjmrEY8dEZmPJTA,"So, anyone in Cleveland knows how bad our ramen options are (whoever says Noodlecat has obviously never been there). I decided to try Otani that just opened last week. 

Broth was good, a little light and not exactly traditional tonkatsu flavor, but literally the best option around. I asked for an egg which they forgot.  The pork is tough. I'll definitely go back and try the chasu or pork belly. My noodles I think were probably made the day before,. LOTS of clumps. This is a huge turn off for me (and part of the reason why I stopped even trying at Noodlecat). I'm interesting in trying again and seeing what other options they have and how fresh it is on different days. 

As far as ramen in Cleveland, it's an option and maybe the best option. As far as authentic ramen period, you might crave more than this.",0
rRTz0zVbjmrEY8dEZmPJTA,The broth for the 1st and 2nd item on the menus is rich and authentic. Noodles were  grear and the meat was well made. Overall very satisfied and the foods were made very quickly too. Good place to grab some good noodles.,1
rRTz0zVbjmrEY8dEZmPJTA,"Really good ramen, better than competitors in Cleveland across the street. Best and most authentic. If Daikaya in DC is a 10, Otani is a 9. Broth good to the last drop, not chicken soup. Pork belly properly cooked but still soft and chewy, not a cinder. Ramen fresh and succulent and not out of a box. Lots of fresh and authentic toppings including marinated egg, nori, and green onion. Staff friendly and efficient. Will go here again the next time I miss Japan.",1
rRTz0zVbjmrEY8dEZmPJTA,"Finally! An authentic ramen place finally opens in the area! As the city definitely lacks good ramen joints, I would have to say this is the best ramen I have had in the city. I usually get the #2 pork belly and it is a great portion size and delicious. I love the accompaniments in it - especially the corn which is different than any other place! The portion size is huge, you get a great amount of meat and broth and noodles, that you will surely be full afterwards! Their chicken wings are good too for a side if you can fit them into your belly. 

They also do great take out and package it up nicely so the noodles dont get soggy. Best of all, they are reasonably priced!

As ramen is my favorite food - I am happy to drive over to this area to get some good authentic ramen!",1
rRTz0zVbjmrEY8dEZmPJTA,"The best place, in my humble opinion, to get Japanese noodle bowls. The food always tastes fresh and the authentic Japanese sodas available are always fun.",1
rRTz0zVbjmrEY8dEZmPJTA,"I find myself coming here twice a week because I am in love with their Miso Ramen Bowl! I usually just order there and then take my food to-go even though they're on Grubhub. But my food always comes out fast no matter how busy they are. The workers are very kind and bring my to-go order right to me, instead of calling me up to the counter or something less friendly. The meal is the perfect portion size. Love this place so much, highly recommend it if you're craving delicious authentic miso soup!!!",1
rRTz0zVbjmrEY8dEZmPJTA,"100% the best ramen in the city! Its tiny but absolutely incredible! Its also super fast, i was in and out in under 30 minutes which is great for lunch if you work nearby.

I got the chicken ramen bowl, packed with flavor. I dont have any other references to go off of as far as authentic ramen but this truly did hit the spot with my belly.The owner Joyce is so helpful and sweet. She actually told me that Otani Noodle uses the real alkaline noodle for the true chewy texture of Japanese ramen which is why its so yummy and its truly authentic and one of a kind in cleveland.

Its a tad pricy i mean considering youre paying for ramen and you can get a 10 pack at walmart for $1.00 i guess they have to charge more haha. But otherwise i dont have any negatives to say about Otani.",1
rRTz0zVbjmrEY8dEZmPJTA,"One of our favorite ramen places. A spinoff of the longstanding (and well-reviewed) Otani Restaurant, they make authentic and high-quality ramen and other dishes. Both of the ramen bases we've tried have been outstanding--the shoyu (soy sauce) type and the tonkotsu soup (pork-based, I think) type. All of the toppings were amazing, as well. Recently tried the spring roll, which was good, too. 
Plus friendly staff, cool decor, good music, and nice location. It has become a must-go place every time we're in Cleveland.",1
RsxqZk0wswetGMaaQh2r2Q,"There is no disputing the authenticity and class of this place.  Every single ingredient is made fresh. The price for cocktails is high, as it should be for the quality of the ingredients.  The decor and music is always great, and they have a delightful patio and back room.  It is not as pretentious as it may seem - the bartenders are friendly and accommodating.  The dress code is reasonable and not irrationally enforced.

This would be a five star review except for the fact that I've been coming here for years and I feel as though the quality of the bartenders has declined in the past year or so.  With this menu, the bartenders really need to be spot on in their mixology.  I have no problem telling a bartender my preferences, so in a place like this it should come out perfect every time.  That's a really high standard, so 4 stars is great!",1
RsxqZk0wswetGMaaQh2r2Q,"I love people that have unreasonable love and who want to share it with others.

In the case of the Velvet Tango Room, we have people who have unreasonable love for things that are old-fashioned, high-quality, hand-crafted and authentic.

Good:
* Don't worry if you don't know about pisco liquor, or haven't a clue about the ""Hemingway daquiri"".  Ask about any drink, and any of the lovely bartenders will tell you about them at length.  They'll recommend their favorite, and prescribe what will suit your taste buds.
* My favorite drinks are the aforementioned pisco sours, Hemingway daquiri (unlike any other slushy, sweet daquiri you've ever had), and the Lady in Pink.  The root beer float with bourbon is delicious.
* The bar itself is a sweet little out of the way place, between Tremont and West Side Market, decked out to be wooden and old-fashioned. 
* Live music on the weekends that isn't so loud that you can't be heard.. A nice change from Bier Market (much as I like that place)

Bad:
* Drinks are not cheap here - $15 each the last time I went, so don't come here to liquor up, that's not the point.  But for $15, it's a damn good drink to be sipped slowly and savored.",1
RsxqZk0wswetGMaaQh2r2Q,"From the moment we stepped into the VTR I knew it was different. The atmosphere is 1920's speakeasy-esque with music to match. The list of specialty cocktails is thoughtful and novel, featuring plenty of obscure classics that most bartenders would have never heard of. But they take these cocktails to the next level by using premium homemade bitters, mixers, etc. Furthermore, extensive research is put into all the drinks an authentic way. The Ramos Gin Fizz is shaken for a full 5 minutes (although according to the drink's creator, it's actually supposed to be shaken for 15). Martinis are stirred rather than shaken.
  I have two gripes that prevent me from granting 5 stars. First is price. I understand that extra labor and premium ingredients here make the drinks more costly than elsewhere. However, the markup seemed excessive in spite of these measures. A Bombay Sapphire martini cost me $15, or a full 50% more than anywhere else in Cleveland.
  Second is food, or rather, a total lack thereof, even by bar standards. There were about 3 or 4 food options (plus a few desserts). A ""speck on rye"" appetizer cost us another $15, consisting of nothing more than a few slices of cured bacon on bread. It was bland and generally disappointing.  
 Overall the VTR is worth hitting up. But because of the dearth of food and inflated prices, I probably won't return as frequently as I would otherwise.",0
RsxqZk0wswetGMaaQh2r2Q,"The Velvet Tango Room has been on my list of places I needed to go seemingly forever. The reason I never made it here until now was really a matter of logistics and self-control issues regarding alcohol. Driving into the bowels of Tremont EXPLICITLY FOR COCKTAILS is totally inadvisable, especially given my questionable driving skills even when sober. (Just ask my wife...she'll be happy to share her indexed documentation and 26-slide Power Point presentation on 'Why I Shouldn't Be Allowed to Drive'. Or perhaps you're more interested in just the Executive Summary?)  

I couldn't hold out any longer, though. The desire for real jazz and fancy homemade cocktails overrode my concerns about a long and recklessly foolish drive back to Richfield. (I am writing this review, so you can draw reasonable inferences that I made it home alive.) 

But I digress.....

In a city riddled with industrial urban decay, the VTR has managed to situate itself on the most desolate, dimmest street possible. It's basically on a forgotten side-street amongst a gloomy row of post-residential houses, directly-facing and almost-underneath a huge fucking steel bridge. (It's a good place to look for ""motivational-speaker"" Matt Foley's van.) A tiny purple neon sign reading ""Velvet Tango Room"" in the window is the only sign that you're in the right place....hell, it's the only sign of life anywhere! The location couldn't be any more obscure. I'm guessing that Paulius' rent be cheap.

Upon entering the front door, the world beyond it dissolves, and you stroll into a clean and classy scene, with jazz playing in the background. We arrived before the crowds, so were able to find choice seats at the bar and receive the full attention of the amazing staff, patiently helping us navigate through Volumes I and II of their leather-bound cocktail menu. These people take their craft very seriously. They tended over our drink selection with such gravity and consultation....like a team of doctors presiding over Al Roker's gastric-bypass. (""Oh, look, it's Ann Curry's right arm!"") The staff were going to make sure we got exactly the right cocktail. I instantly wanted to be best friends with everyone behind the bar. My liver and I have rarely felt so spoiled and special.

And yes, the cocktails were indeed delicious. I was honestly expecting more Hemingway-macho-poisonous-whisky-hair-on-your-chest-scary-things, but most of the drinks were instead vibrant, light, and fresh. The Moscow mule was a standout, full of intense ginger. The cocktails were full of tastes exciting and unfamiliar.

The VTR also gets extra points for supplying some authentic jazz music and musicians...something that I find inexplicably rare in this city. Some of the music that I have heard passed off as ""live jazz"" around town haunts me. Taking liberties with 'Sweet Caroline' on a drum-machine is NOT jazz. Playing Jimmy Buffet in diminished seventh chords is NOT jazz, either. You know who you are.

My only complaint...and it's minor... is that the dÁE©cor is a bit too ""ew construction"". In some ways, it strikes me as a very-nicely decorated finished basement at your lawyer friend's suburban McMansion. At the same time, however, I appreciate the honesty of it....no one is pretending that this place is a hold-over from the Prohibition Era or anything...but I guess I've been spoiled by places like The Green Mill in Chicago, which reportedly boasts actual gangster-era bullet holes in the walls put there by Al Capone's thugs (or perhaps Geraldo Rivera's publicist). Anyway, the transcendent, vintage cocktails and classic black-and-white movies being shown above the bar at the VTR made up for any moodiness elsewhere lacked.

If the VTR ever was a secret, the secret is definitely out now, and it's seemingly become a local curiosity for everyone who's ever read a newspaper and sought an urban adventure. As the evening progressed, I was looking outside to see how many of these people arrived via tour bus. Let's just say I'm not sure everyone there was seeking the purity of experience I was. At it's inception, I'm guessing VTR would have been an easy 5-stars. Success and notoriety have diluted that to 4 or 4-1/2. Still a unique and cool place, though. It's gonna take a lot more doucebags than this to ruin the Velvet Tango Room.o",1
RsxqZk0wswetGMaaQh2r2Q,"Bring the credit card because these cocktails are expensive folks but you truly get what you pay for!  This is an EXPERIENCE, not just a drink.  The neighborhood is dicey, the exterior understated, the decor is classic, the bar is authentic, the bartenders are hot, and the drinks are 'bar none', the BEST!  Try the Moscow Mule!",1
Rt7gjrTceO86sCtnS8Td0g,"I love this place for lunch in the Playhouse Square district. They are super accommodating of my nut allergy - even changing their gloves without needing to be asked! The house salad is super delicious and fresh. Servings are extremely generous, and the home-cooked meats are juicy. I return at least once a week at lunch and the staff is always cheerful and friendly. Highly recommended!",1
RUxGUjjeRfwHvBNbuxrasw,"An indispensable part of the iconic West Side Market and a Cleveland corner stone in finding European Import groceries. I've been shopping here since I first immigrated to the area from Germany (more than 35 years ago). For years this store was the only place around Cleveland to offer things like Nutella, Marzipan, those delicious individually wrapped soft caramel candies from Poland or hundreds of other food items people on the other side of the Atlantic take for granted. Sure, you can find Nutella at big US grocery chains now, but Mediterranean Import Foods still has the best value, and their groceries are always fresh and delicious! Whether you need ingredients for a special meal or just want to indulge in some of the finer things like fresh dates or exotic spices, it's all here! Operated the old fashined way like a European ""Ma and Pa's"" shop (Germans would call it ""Tante Emma Laden""), this places gives you an authentic taste of times gone by. Whatever you bring home from this store, you probably won't find better food or a better value anyplace else. 5 stars from this reviewer.",1
Rv-Gg0gqteFU3WEYjHvurg,"I ate at Cilantro last night, which was their opening day. Very good!  It is in the old Chipotle, and the decor is essentially the same, as is the set up. Basically cafeteria style and you tell them what toppings you want. But everything tasted great and authentic and fresh, and the staff was very nice, though obviously still learning. I believe they are all Hispanic, which bodes well. :) Standouts for those of us who went: shrimp tacos,  carnitas, and the guacamole. All delish!
There were a few items they didn't have yet, including alcohol (next week they will have beer and margaritas), ""choco-flan"" (should have by today), and perch for tacos (soon). Tacos are $2.50 ea, large burritos or bowls are around eight or nine bucks, $1 extra to add guacamole. Note to haters of the herb, cilantro: most items don't have cilantro in them, you can have it added.",1
Rv-Gg0gqteFU3WEYjHvurg,"This place is amazing. We started going every week. It's authentic Mexican but has the same set up as a chipotle or Moe's. I don't mind paying a few extra bucks to enjoy this. They have great portions of the protein you pick and the queso comes on it at no extra cost. The service is really wonderful, the people there are really nice. I can tell this place is becoming extremely popular.",1
Rv-Gg0gqteFU3WEYjHvurg,"Nice small spot. Like an authentic Chipotle. Homemade salsa, friendly staff, open late 3 days out the week, good music selection and TACO TUESDAYS!",1
Rv-Gg0gqteFU3WEYjHvurg,Good food but ultimately a bit over priced in my opinion. Think Chipotle but more authentic. Coincidentally I believe this used to be a Chipotle location. Lots of fun toppings to choose from!,1
Rv-Gg0gqteFU3WEYjHvurg,"I've been here a couple times now but make a point to eat here when I come to Cleveland. It's super delicious, authentic, and cheap. 

I love this spot. The portion sizes are huge and they load up your order. The meats are cooked really well and there's a couple more options than you'd find at a chipotle. Beef tongue and al pastor are delicious but my favorite here is the carnitas. 

The staff here is nice and friendly. The guys who load up your order are very generous and the people who check you out are funny high white guys.",1
Rv-Gg0gqteFU3WEYjHvurg,"It's great to have a locally-owned, authentic mexican restaurant replace the Chipotle in Coventry Village. I just had a chicken taco and shrimp taco and they were amazing... and only cost $5.

If you liked Chipotle -- you'll LOVE Cilantro Taqueria!",1
Rv-Gg0gqteFU3WEYjHvurg,"Amazing!! Since moving to Cleveland from the west coast I haven't found an authentic taco, but this place is great. Simple tacos on two corn tortillas with a bunch of meat options and toppings like a true taco bar. Food is a reasonable price too. I'll be a regular here.",1
Rv-Gg0gqteFU3WEYjHvurg,"I and my boyfriend stopped for a late dinner, and at first glance looks a lot like a chipotle type establishment but the food is waaaay better. Between the two of us we had surf and turf, chorizo, lengua, and pastor tacos, and al were excellent. Tasted very authentic.",1
Rv-Gg0gqteFU3WEYjHvurg,"I don't even know where to begin, this place is authentic and well cooked Mexican food. It's fast casual (set up like a chipotle), with a variety of alcoholic drink options. They have unique options like lengua (which is my favorite), but also amazingly cooked carnitas and steak. I usually get a bowl, which comes with a choice of Mexican or white rice, and is enough food for two definitely. They have DEADLY margaritas, which usually come with a floater and a shot in the glass ($12 pitchers on fri/sat). The staff is great, the owner is usually there and also working with a smile on his face. I came here originally to find a michelada and found the best Mexican food in this area. You will not be disappointed. Forgot to mention, they make the best salsa verde and I usually don't tell them to add it to my meal because they have it in the condiment station and I like to pile it on myself.",1
Rv-Gg0gqteFU3WEYjHvurg,This place is a hidden gem of Coventry!! The people inside are super cool and friendly! The Al Pastor is delicious and they have some of the best chorizo I've had in my life. The elotes are pretty tasty especially with a few slices of lime on the side!!! I had lost all hope in finding an authentic Mexican place when I moved to Cleveland but this has by far won my heart. Prices are very fair for portion sizes and they have plenty of drink options too. Seating area is very clean and comfy!!! The salsa bar is definitely one of the best parts too!! This was a great addition to Coventry and I hope it stays around!!!!!,1
Rv-Gg0gqteFU3WEYjHvurg,"I had the al pastor, lengua, shrimp, chicken, and chorizo tacos. All were really good except for the chicken which was a bit bland. It was pretty authentic - grilled jalapeÁE±os at the salsa bar and corn tortillas. Friendly service. Can't wait to go again.",1
Rv-Gg0gqteFU3WEYjHvurg,"Cancel Chipotle, cancel Moe's, cancel Qdoba. Most authentic option around. Bowls are massive and full of flavor.",1
Rv-Gg0gqteFU3WEYjHvurg,They have succulent grilled shrimp! That's all I need for a great bowl or burrito. They have authentic meats with grease which enhance the flavors.,1
Rv-Gg0gqteFU3WEYjHvurg,"I'm so glad this place took over the old Chipotle! They have the same format as Chipotle but their food quality is authentic, delicious, and fresh! They have margaritas too!

Rv-Gg0gqteFU3WEYjHvurg,"It's very Chipotle-esque in set up and concept but with much more authentic food.

Rv-Gg0gqteFU3WEYjHvurg,"I had a burrito and tacos from here when it first opened... so i came here 2 times when it was new. It was ok. Very authentic but i felt it was a little bland

Now months after they've been open, I feel like the rice and meat got way better and I love it!.... 

always come back and try things again!!!",1
Rv-Gg0gqteFU3WEYjHvurg,Definitely one of my favorites in town. I drive over 30 min just to eat here almost weekly. Hoping for an expansion to the west side of Cleveland! Love the build your own concept while keeping the ingredients authentic.,1
Rv-Gg0gqteFU3WEYjHvurg,"I visited on a Friday night (2 August 2019) around 10:30pm which is late but I had to eat something. I was in the neighbourhood and I needed to eat. I had just come from the MIX party event at the Cleveland Museum of Art so all that dancing left me famished plus I hadn't had dinner yet...LOL. Luckily, they close at 2am on Fridays.

SERVICE -- I walked up to the counter and ordered. The 2 employees greeted me and one of them took my order. Very nice and general service.

TACOS -- The taco's here are very delicious. My friend ordered shrimp tacos and she loved them especially since you can add a ton of toppings such as tomatoes, salsa, etc. They are $3 to $3.50 a piece depending on what meat you get. They also have a vegetarian taco which is filled with vegetables. 

Similar to the tacos at La Plaza Supermarket (read my review of that place), these tacos here are also super SMALL. I was told that the tacos and food in general here are authentic because the owner is from Mexico so that's cool.

I ordered 1 Shrimp taco ($3.50) and 1 Surf & Turf taco ($3.50) which is a mixture of Steak and Shrimp. Both tasted delicious with the mild salsa that I added. The shrimp taco came on a flour tortilla. I preferred the taste of the flour tortilla. The steak & shrimp taco came on 2 corn tortilla's. The corn tortilla has a unique taste so next time, I'll get all tacos on a flour tortilla. 

I was still hungry after eating but the 2 small tacos that I ate still satisfied my appetite plus it was late so I didn't want to eat too much. Both tacos cost $3.50 but I checked my bank and I was only charged $6.50 total so perhaps the shrimp taco itself was just $3. Maybe somehow I got .50 cents discount....haha. Nonetheless, the taco price is reasonable and quite typical of most other restaurants.

LOCATION -- They are located in the Cleveland Heights neighbourhood in an area with local shops. Parking can be a pain but there is a small parking lot on Coventry Road with meters. I didn't have to use the parking meters when I parked so perhaps they are free after a certain time.

Overall, I recommend their tacos. Come here if you are seeking a late night food spot that is better than fast food. They also have rice bowls on their menu just like Chipotle but the rice bowls here are $2 more than the Chipotle ones.

Rv-Gg0gqteFU3WEYjHvurg,"I really like cilantro tacqueria for some fast, great tasting food & drinks. They're conveniently located on a street that has other food places as well, if you're in the mood to eat! 

Cilantro tacqueria, in my opinion, is a better/more authentic version of chipotle/moe's/qdoba. Their food always tastes fresh and full of flavor. They give you a TON more in quantity than the other chains. I can never finish a whole burrito bowl in one sitting. They also have happy hour deals every day of the week, which includes drink AND food deals depending on the day. Their margaritas have never failed yet. Everyone I know who has tried one has had nothing but great things to say. They offer a variety of flavors as well. 

It's totally affordable and awesome service, I definitely recommend trying it out!",1
RwwV2LrIbdquFw6SN-l27Q,We had a large group and ordered most of the dishes. The beef noodle soup is the best I've had in Cleveland! It's very difficult to find a place that has both the perfectly cooked beef and the authentic noodles. I would definitely come back a lot for this noodle soup. The pork belly in baked bun and cumin lamb in baked bun are also very authentic! I can totally have them every day. We shared the Szechuan chili pots. They are very flavored. I especially like that they put various kinds of vegetables. I am really excited that this restaurant is bringing so many authentic food to the university Circle!,1
RwwV2LrIbdquFw6SN-l27Q,"The food is NOT authentic Chinese food, beef noodle soup is way too sweet and noodle is very soggy. cumin lamb in baked bun, the lamb is hard and over cooked, but didn't marinate well so it still has the stinky taste of lamb. 
I went there because of the Hong Kong style bubble tea with milk crown, it does taste pretty good, but the boba in there was not made very well, basically melted in the drink, and had no taste. Hope they can improve the tapioca in there.",0
RwwV2LrIbdquFw6SN-l27Q,"I visited here on opening day! August 10, 2018! Glamorous! My understanding of this restaurant is that it was opened by a Case Western graduate who wanted to provide some more authentic Chinese food to the neighborhood.

On entering, they've kept a lot of the old architecture that was at ninja city, which I think was a wise choice. It looks great.

Because it was the first night there were open, there were a few hiccups. I don't eat meat, but I do eat fish, and I asked if anything could be made vegetarian - 95% of the dishes have a meat ingredient listed - and I was told that one dish could be vegetarian. Unfortunately, when the dish came out, it had sausage in it, and I was informed that it could not be made vegetarian because it was all made in one pot. No problem! I ordered a tofu dish. I was subsequently informed that the sauce for that dish has meat, so they kindly brought out all of the different components of the dish for me to eat, which I thought was a lovely gesture.

Unfortunately, I think the dish didn't come together very well as separate components and ended up being reasonably bland. My friends, however, loved their bao and pork buns. 

Ultimately, I think Nujoy is good right now but not great. It shows a ton of promise, but organization right now is of paramount importance.

A couple of suggestions:

1. Label on the menu which dishes can be made vegetarian

2. Generally, write what ingredients are in the dishes on the menu so that people with food allergies can choose accordingly.

3. Keep making great food. I suppose that isn't a suggestion.

I plan to visit again in a month or so when they've ironed out the kinks. Looking forward to it!",1
RwwV2LrIbdquFw6SN-l27Q,"This place is definitely better than all the other restaurants in the area when it comes to true authentic Chinese food. Being a student from China, I cannot find a better place to grab lunch and dinner. I love their noodle in soybean paste, true Beijing style! Also the kababs are awesome too. Some of my friends say it's a bit overpriced, but I keep telling them you can't compare a sit down restaurant with good interior vs. a takeout only place, so in my opinion the prices are justified. 

I also enjoy their tea drinks, unlike anything you can find in Cleveland!",1

The grilled squid didn't taste grilled, baked bun is way way way overpriced.  Spring roll was supposed to use the rice skin, but they use the Americanized tortilla with thick skin...the only good things were the beef noodle soup and boiled dumplings... my chili beef was very dry and chewy, vegetables in the chill beef was Americanized...  

There is not much authenticity about the food here.  I do not recommend.",0
RwwV2LrIbdquFw6SN-l27Q,"NÁE¼joy is an impressive little restaurant in University Circle.  Parking is certainly a hassle but we were able to find street parking a block away.

We came for lunch which uses the same menu for dinner.  Other diners included Chinese students from Case,  a few casual dinners and maybe some contractor types at the bar.

Nothing authentic about any of the food here and we end it up ordering the pork rib chili pot and cumin lamb as well the bao. Bao clearly frozen which is fine but chili pot rib came out luke warm and cumin lamb was cold. Not sure how that's possible if cumin lamb was ordered 15 min before it came out unless it was left over or refrigerated from prior. In any case, food was too salty and ate the pork rib chili pot and definitely got food poisoning. Was nauseated afterwards and had to retch/vomit in the toilet bowel as if I was in college.

Boo Radley merchandise! Plus Kiss, Brady bunch and some adult birthday crap as well... Old library card catalog cabinets full of plastic and glass things, marbles, and other small things you should not put in your nose.

I asked the heavily tatted, bearded, bored, vacant, inattentive, texting dude ( standing next to his fellow female coworker - same attitude, different shirt)  at the counter if  he could tell me what the very cool Monkey Mobile Matchbox car in the case cost. He asked if I intended to buy it. I replied that I didn't know till I found out what it cost. He harrumphed, and, muttering under his beard, began the long and obviously painful process of unlocking the cabinet and reaching in to check the price.
I felt so bad for him...in fact, I told him to nevermind...I didn't NEED the item anyway.

Right after I wrote this, A very nice and well respected member of the Cleveland Yelp Community wrote to me. I think this exchange is telling:

Mr X:

Hey Mike, Big Fun is truly an AWSOME place but the hipster doofuses that are employed there need to be overlooked...
They're nothing more than cash register button pushers that don't have a clue about MOST of the stuff in Big Fun...
There is another one on the west side that should be better and consider that next time you are in town.
Cheers!

Thanks for the heads-up.

Problem is - the staff IS the business to anyone who is not just walking through. I wanted to buy a few rather pricey things, but damn is I'll give my money to anyone who acts extremely annoyed that I was there.

Nope ... never again!

Peace :)

Mr X,

Sorry to beat a dead horse, but there are three prime aspects to a business.

Environment, product and service.

I can't overlook a dirty, mean  a$%*$le his wages. Why does the management think so little of their clientele that they not only charge 2-3 times wholesale but also subject them to people like this whilst trying to buy ??

Just a bunch of sheep I guess..

Just my thoughts, thanks for the words!

Mr X:

Yup...
I get it...
Peace!

Hey no worries, I share your mindset about that...I've done my fair share of retail therefore expect  certain things...

That was hands down THE BEST (yes, that required all caps) meal out I've had in a long time. 

So, we all know the concept of this place, yes? I don't need to go into heavy detail describing the decor or talking about how much of everything is locally-sourced, farm-to-table, etc., etc. We've all read enough of these to know--although it's still very impressive. 

But honestly, living in Ohio City, where there are plenty of fabulous places, also sourcing locally within a few feet and a just a few miles, I was wondering if this place was really going to be able to surprise me... Well, it did more than that. It impressed my face off. LIterally, picture my face melting off from pure impressed feelings.

Now, this may seem strange to others, but I loved that the first person to say ""hello"" to us was the bartender who was cleaning some glassware. See, the bar is located right next to the front door. Instead of walking in and seeing a hostess at a stand staring at you, it felt much more relaxed, yet personal. Hard to explain, but I like that. 

In fact, the service the entire time was impeccable. From the bartender who greeted us, the host/water guy who took us right to a table (and read the specials/made some suggestions) to our waiter who was the definition of a perfect server. Professional, yet talkative. I don't know how anyone has ever had a less than stellar service experience here, because they were on it. 

The food was incredible. We started with the mushroom beignets and although I've had authentic beignets in New Orleans, I really didn't know what to expect. Welp, they knocked this out of the park. No wonder why it's a mainstay on the menu--if you don't order theses, you'll be sorry. They're not *super* mushroom-y, but very savory and the honey goat cheese creme fraiche in combo with these crispy dumplings is life changing. 

We also gave the tomato bisque special a try, since the host recommended it. I know what you're thinking--boring. Bisque is so done. This was divine, like fill a hottub with it and marinate in it good. The bowl was clean. 

For main courses, I orded the pan-seared walleye (and keep in mind they change their menu very often) which was served with broccolini, carrot puree and tomato ginger verde. All I can tell you is to get there ASAP to make sure you try this dish before they change the menu again. The fish was light, perfected seared and there were two filets! The verde was perfect... well, everything just went together perfectly. My boyfriend ordered the lamb two ways. It came with a couple of shanks and some meatballs. I tried it and it stopped my world. I must have more lamb in my life. 

Normally we're not dessert people, but we were convinced the special was to die for--and of course, it was. I honestly cannot remember was it was, totally, but I know it had waffles with a frozen creme concoction. Happy, happy times. 

I will also note that I allowed the server to suggest me a white wine to go with my walleye and what he suggested is now my favorite white wine of all time. 

Perfect everything. Thoroughly impressed. Our new favorite restaurant (myself and the pickiest man alive, my boyfriend.)",1
s1FNMwBVBmC7mLfYy77e8g,"Came here recently on a date with my husband! We enjoyed our time here at Spice and thought everything was pretty solid. Spice has a wonderful vision and mission to use as much local goods as possible. Turns out Ohio is a great place to do this with all our amazing local farms!

Our favorite appetizer was a special: fresh halibut chowder with lobster oil. MM. It was good! Please make this a regular menu item! The flavor was really great. 5 for the chowder.

We also had a 3 local-mushroom pesto flatbread with goat cheese. The mushrooms were oyster, chantrelle, and one more I can't remember...the mushrooms were fresh and good tasting. 4 for the flatbread.

I ordered the Spice Acres Polenta with ratatouille and eggplant puree, which I think was a vegan dish. The polenta was fried rather than creamy, a good complement to the puree and ratatouille. The eggplant had a pretty strong flavor, but it was intriguing enough to keep eating.

My husband ordered the special - fresh trout (that day!) with sweet potato puree. This was amazing!!! They gave him the entire fish -- something you don't see very often except in authentic Chinese restaurants (mmm). I loved that they did this because I feel that we were able to enjoy every aspect of the fish, from the regular filet to the cheeks, etc. It was also served like someone had just caught it, fried it up, and served it. So great. 

Overall, we enjoyed our time. One thing I noted..they don't give complimentary bread, so be sure to order some appetizers if you are coming in hungry. Other than that, be enjoy the local and fresh dishes!",1
S1zlGFu9fi5-QmVpGqsKsA,"Outstanding, authentic Italian food. Atmosphere was nice, low lighting but not too dim. Waiter was very knowledgeable with the menu and wines. I have a wheat intolerance and the chef was able to make adjustments to my meal and it was still lovely. A good app to try was the calamari, it was mouth watering. The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars was that the waiter left us waiting at several points during the meal for him to return to refill drinks and bring us the bill. Would recommend for a fancy date, company dinner, special occasions.",1
S1zlGFu9fi5-QmVpGqsKsA,"Truly average Food.  I wont even call it real Italian cuisine.  I just came from Quartino's in Chicago which puts Michaelangelos to shame.  Superb authentic Italian meal at 1/2 the cost that this place charges.  They try and mask it with a fancy atmosphere, but the food quality just isn't there.  The Pappardelle Bolognese was sadly bland, no fresh flavor, and had a Chef Boyardee taste to it. I thought I could salvage the meal with the  ""home made Gelato"".  This was a joke when it comes to gelato.  It was flavorless frozen cream with a texture of ice crystals.  Chef needs to take a trip to Chicago and dine in some real Italian restaurants there.",0

This review is long overdue, as the Mister and I treated ourselves to a nice dinner for Valentine's Day this past year. Better late than never, right?

We decided to try a spot that has been on my list for AGES. Michaelangelo's, a fine establishment just across the street from us, has received rave reviews since it opened its doors in 2006. In fact, last year the restaurant was Zagat Rated!

Review highlights:

This romantic retreat offers authentic Northern Italian Cuisine from chef/co-owner Michael Annandoro, along with an extensive selection of wines and a stylish bar area. With a large fireplace for winter and a patio for warmer weather, its an ideal choice for a special night out.

We started with the house multi-grain bread and flavored olive oil.

We ordered our ""go-to"" Italian appetizer, which is normally any dish that includes mozzarella and prosciutto. As soon as we spotted the ""Bufala,"" we knew we had to have it. Described on the menu as buffalo mozzarella, prosciutto di parma and roasted red peppers, this dish was the perfect way to kick off our dinner. The mozzarella was rich, creamy and a great match for the salty prosciutto.

Knowing that I'd be ordering an indulgent treat, I thought it would be best to order something light. But light and healthy doesn't mean flavorless - NO SIREE. This simple arugula salad was packed with incredible flavors! I loved the rich quality of the olive oil and the lemon was such a refreshing touch. The salad contained minced garlic and onion, as well as salty, savory Parmesan cheese. The Mister stole a few bites and proclaimed it to be one of the best salads he's ever tasted (Joey's Ceasar Salad in Chagrin Falls in also on the list).

For my ""dinner"" I ordered the Minestrone soup. Without a doubt, this was one of the heartiest Minestrones I've ever had. This thing was chock-full of root vegetables and beans -- so filling! It had quite a kick, too (luckily my whimpy taste buds could handle it, though!).

The Mister was kind enough to let me pick from all the decadent dessert offerings. In addition to the standard menu, the server explained some of the Valentine's Day features. I heard the words ""chocolate bomb"" and was sold. The chocolate coating contained rich and creamy chocolate mousse - like a little present from the chocolate Gods! While some chocolate dishes can be too rich and quickly weigh you down, this was the perfect balance. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.

The Mister and I decided that we'll be heading back to Michaelangelo's very soon. But this time we BOTH plan on ordering soup and salad  - that way we'll have room for an extra dessert!

This was such a great evening! The ambiance of the restaurant was very romantic and I loved every minute of chatting with the Mister and enjoying his company. Let's face it, Valentine's Day dinners have a pretty bad rep. From noisy and over-crowded restaurants, to poor service and cold food, I've heard all the horror stories. But if anything, Michaelangelo's went above and beyond to make sure our dining experience was special. Our waiter was so helpful and attentive and we never felt rushed. Make sure you give Michaelangelo's a try for your next special occasion -- they'll make sure you leave with some great memories",1
S1zlGFu9fi5-QmVpGqsKsA,"Having been to many of Cleveland's Italian restaurants, my fiance and I generally enjoyed our time at Michaelangelo's, but likely won't be back. It's one of the pricier (if not priciest) establishments around Little Italy, and while the dark decor in the bar area and happy hour features were impressive, the rest of the restaurant lacked the character and authenticity you get at other Little Italy restaurants. Authenticity also seemed to lack in the food - my fiance ordered the Ossobuco, which was *drowning* in marinara sauce. The risotto tasted as though it had been rushed - not creamy as it should have been. The halibut I had completely lacked flavor, and I had to salt every bit of the meal I was presented with. Our recommendation is to try this place for happy hour, but avoid for the main course.",0
S1zlGFu9fi5-QmVpGqsKsA,If you are looking for authentic Italian food in Cleveland this is definitely a place to check out. Occupying the mid to high end of the price scale Michaelangelo's boasts amazing service and terrific food. I enjoyed the lobster ravioli in particular,1
sfd19Wo_7g2TwaoJmA9B8A,"The best I can really say for this is that it did not make me sick. I love Chinese food, be it authentic Chinese food or greasy Americanized ""Chinese"" food but this meal failed to be an adequate representation of either. The chicken and broccoli just had an off flavor and the potstickers were rather hard and tasteless. I did like the dipping sauce that came with the potstickers. I had takeout so it is possible that this accounted for my disappointment. Unfortunately, I am not willing to risk another bad meal.
Service was polite and the dining room appears very pleasant. If the food quality isn't there, though, everything else is kind of irrelevant.",0
sfd19Wo_7g2TwaoJmA9B8A,"There are a few times life that a meal is expertly planned....... I have dined here on a number of occasions. I did not find oily vegetables nor centipedes in my food. I walked in to a very nicely lit nicely set restaurant that had great service, a full bar, hot, fresh food served on beautiful China, soft music, great restaurant that was clean and rather reasonably priced. I don't need to come from China to tell you this. I suspect the food is not that authentic so don't fret- its a great place and a great place to take a date.",1
sfd19Wo_7g2TwaoJmA9B8A,"The decor and vibe were very relaxed and authentic. The food too was quite good. I've been in Cleveland for over 6 months now and I think this is the best Chinese place I've tried here. We ordered the chicken Lo Mein and sweet and sour chicken, both of which were tasty. The tea also got a thumbs up.

A star off because the menu was a bit confusing and the waiter had to go around explaining it to everyone. (Which could be good because they made sure you didn't end up with something you didn't want.)",1
sfd19Wo_7g2TwaoJmA9B8A,"Yup, not very authentic, just so-so food.  Not very impressed.  Some of my friends really like this place, but they are also the friends that rave about PF Changs.  So... I guess if you like Americanized Chinese food and don't dare venture out to the Asia Plaza area, it's the place for you.",0
sfd19Wo_7g2TwaoJmA9B8A,"I was looking to celebrate Chinese New Year but was disappointed that it was similar to Chinese take out food on a nicer platter. It is heavy in sauce, although the setting appears to be very Cantonese. I had a chicken and vegetable dish, and would be willing to return to try other items, but having higher expectations for Chinese food, I would definitely make the venture to Asiatown for closer to authentic crafted cuisine.",0
SGZAsdQAp0SjtMDjXWBPYw,"Honestly, the food was so good I dove right in and did not take any pictures. I am from Pittsburgh, I've also been to Thailand, and I cant find an amazing Thai place in Cleveland, but I finally did with Banana Blossom. I love spice and when i say they dont lie, THEY DO NOT LIE. I got a three out of five and it was so so hot(drunken noodles). I got the scallion pancakes to start, a thai iced tea and the pad se ew (drunken noodles). My friend got the pad thai with the default of chicken and shrimp it was so good. And I could tell some people working there were speaking thai, so authentic and my new fave place. I also love the decor, the colors on the wall give it such a warm vibe, I'm obnoxiously obsessed.",1
SGZAsdQAp0SjtMDjXWBPYw,"So many options here!  I love Thai food and if you are looking for authenticity this is the Thai restaurant to try.  So good and so much to choose from.  I love the basil fried rice, but you definitely need to tell the cooks what spice level you want or you will need a lot of water.  For me, the spicier the better!  Must try guys!",1
SGZAsdQAp0SjtMDjXWBPYw,"The food here is awesome!! I am Thai so I can really tell that many dishes served here are very authentic. I love Pad See Iw here very much. The Thai Basil, Garlic Chicken, and Crispy Duck basil are also amazing. The staffs and the restaurant owner are very very friendly. This is so far my most favorite Thai restaurant in Cleveland.",1
SGZAsdQAp0SjtMDjXWBPYw,"This is my favorite place for Thai food in Cleveland. It's an authentic Thai restaurant tucked away in a cozy side street, away from the hustle and bustle of Ohio City's main street of restaurants and breweries. I have tried almost everything on their menu, and I highly recommend the Pad Thai dish if you fancy the classic noodles, the Pad See Ew dish if you crave thicker and wider noodles with a more soy saucy taste, and also the Curry dishes if you want to add some spice into your life. Service is friendly and accommodating. If you haven't been here before, they tend to recommend you start off your spicy level at 1 out of 5. I think 3/5 is the maximum I'm able to handle. As a tip, ask for extra spice on the side. They take reservations over the phone, which is helpful for busy dinner times if you have a large party and don't want to wait. They also do carry out and close at relatively late hours which is awesome! Free street parking is located along the side road of the restaurant, which is convenient. Overall, Banana Blossom is a great place for a dinner date, a family meal outing, or a satisfying foodie experience with a group of friends in an intimate setting. Highly recommend!",1
SGZAsdQAp0SjtMDjXWBPYw,"There's a tough competition in Cleveland for Thai food, but Banana Blossom has won the best Thai food award in my opinion :) 

I ordered the pad see ew and spicy crispy duck. Both were so amazing!! The pad see ew has a very authentic taste with super thick, chewy and delicious noodles :) Their spice levels are a little different from other places. I asked for my usual medium spice level, which was actually a little too spicy for me! So their mild is probably equivalent to medium in other places. And the CRISPY DUCK. Oh dear god, this is life changing!! The dish comes with several pieces of fried duck drenched with some savory red curry sauce. MmMm it's soosososoooo good! You just have to try it for yourself! 

If you are a big fan of Thai food, then you need to check this place out!",1
SGZAsdQAp0SjtMDjXWBPYw,"A hidden gem in Ohio City. The noodles and veggies are fresh and delicious. Homemade pot stickers and sauce are savory and tender.  The piece d'resistance, however, is the Coconut Soup. It tastes and smells amazing, so much that I have been thinking of it since dinner yesterday! Do yourself a favor and frequent this family-owned authentic Thai restaurant.",1
SGZAsdQAp0SjtMDjXWBPYw,"This week I had the best and most authentic Thai food that I have ever eaten! 
The chef even came out to assist my companion and I in determining the items that we might want to consider ordering.
He then came out again to see is we were enjoying our selection.
Quiet and relaxing atmosphere in which to enjoy a meal.",1
SGZAsdQAp0SjtMDjXWBPYw,A great selection of delicious meals at affordable prices.  Cozy atmosphere with lovely authentic Thai decor.  We have enjoyed the pleasant and polite service and the excellent dishes during multiple visits.  I look forward to going back there.,1
SGZAsdQAp0SjtMDjXWBPYw,"Even though this restaurant is in such a random part of town and it's quaint and not all that bustling, Banana Blossom was delicious.
I started my meal with a Thai Iced Tea. Perfect. Not too sweet and overdone with the milk, and not too bitter.
I ordered the Lard Na with wide rice noodles at a Level 3 (Thai Spicy). I love spicy food, but level 3 was surprisingly more hot than I expected. It was still delicious, and I was able to devour my bowl, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel a bit warm with my mouth burning. Nevertheless, mama didn't raise no b*tch, so I killed it. The spice was nice, but I think next time I'll go with Level 2, so it's even more enjoyable without worry or sweat.
Based on the taste of this Lard Na, it's approved by me. I order Lard Na at every Thai restaurant I visit, and this place did not let me down. Tastes pretty dang authentic. Yum!",1
SGZAsdQAp0SjtMDjXWBPYw,"Fresh and delicious food, elegantly served in reasonable portions, attentive service, serene surroundings.  The pad thai was tasty and subtle, while the spicy crispy duck was nicely browned outside, meltingly tender inside, and accompanied by a sauce so delicious that my dinner companion kept stealing spoonfuls off my plate.  The salad and drinks were also inviting.  We will definitely be visiting again (and again and again.)  By the way, another diner ordered a dish marked ""spicy"" and then complained that it was ""hot.""  It was returned to the kitchen with no arguments and gracious apologies and replaced with something blander.  I ordered hot and would not have minded more authentic heat!  However, the goodness of the ingredients makes this restaurant a palate pleaser.  Banana Blossom is the genuine article and an outstanding restaurant.",1
SGZAsdQAp0SjtMDjXWBPYw,Best Thai food in Cleveland. Better than Peppermint in Pepper Pike or any other place in town. Without a doubt the best and only authentic option.,1
SGZAsdQAp0SjtMDjXWBPYw,"Fantastic Thai food that is full of flavor and desired level of spice!  The menu has lots of variety with the Pad See Iw being my favorite as the sauce is great and the noodles are cooked to perfection.  The space itself feels authentic and relaxing, while it is also in a good part of Ohio City for quick pickup/takeout.",1
SGZAsdQAp0SjtMDjXWBPYw,"An already known ""A lister"" Thai restaurant in Cleveland! This place is off the beaten path on the outskirts of Ohio City but it is amazing! Spice lovers- this cook knows how to bring the heat. The restaurant is small and very nicely decorated with authentic Thai decor and art pieces. The flavor, presentation and vibrancy of color and veggies is so enjoyable. The staff is so kind and thoughtful. I was given a free appetizer with my to go meals as there was a wait more than was promised!! Hand down if your looking for something different and a burst of flavor in Ohio City this is the place. I'm a big fan.",1
Sja9RHq7FpwDcmfzbGfIxQ,"Went looking for an authentic Irish Pub and found it. Morgan is ""The Man."" He fixes drinks and entertains everyone is one fell swoop. He's a gentleman to the ladies and a gives the guys a good smack down. Next time I'm in Cleveland, I will visit again.",1
SoCjdgcYyj05tSPWz6MUXg,"I went on a Friday afternoon, why did I do that?! I waited 30-40 min for my food. I got the fried fish. It was good and authentic but I don't think its worth the wait. Next time I'll do like most people there and order ahead!!",0
SoCjdgcYyj05tSPWz6MUXg,"This is one of my favorite food spots in the city!  The food is great, cheap And authentic. It's genuinely a hole-in-the-wall. It's not meant to be a fancy eat-in-spot. I always get it to-go and I have fed 2 ppl into 'itis' for $15. I usually get a mix of papusa, tacos and tamales. 

Their tres leches is decent (per a friend, I don't eat pastries)",1
SoCjdgcYyj05tSPWz6MUXg,"My review is pretty much the same as Karyn's below. Between two of us, we got the fried fish dish (tilapia), two pupusas (the one with pork rinds and the other with the cheese and herbs), and two tacos (pastor and beef tongue). It was a little over $20 for all that I believe. I'll start with....holy smokes that was so much food. The tilapia dish alone is enough for 1.5-2 people. The pupusas are cheap but super filling as they're stuffed.

The tilapia dish was good, didn't have a fishy smell. But like Karyn said, a little too salty. You need to eat it with the rice provided. Good crisp level without being over burnt. The papusas were really good, star of the meal IMO. The one with pork rinds was really good, the other not as much. Tacos were pretty good too. I've had better al pastor tacos, but the beef tongue was quite good and not something I see in many Hispanic restaurants.

We went on a Sunday,on which they have a beef soup special. To be honest, it didn't look that good, but perhaps it tastes very good as most people seemed to have gotten that while we were there.

Lastly, the place is very authentic, from Spanish only speaking cashiers to the clientele. If you're expected some super clean place, you'll be disappointed. The place is gritty and looks like a home kitchen in the back.",1
SoCjdgcYyj05tSPWz6MUXg,"Pupusas here are awesome. When you step up to the counter to order, they give you a checklist of the menu, similar to that of Happy Dog, with more options than just tubes of meat and toppings. One list is in Spanish. If you cannot understand, ask for the English. The staff does not speak English. This makes the dining experience even better. The service is more like that of a fast food restaurant. After turning in the checklist, you sit and wait. It did take a while to get the food. El Salvadorian food is very good. Get some pupusa! This is a must visit restaurant to try out some authentic food from El Salvador!",1
SoCjdgcYyj05tSPWz6MUXg,"Food is just amazing ,everything is so delicious.The place is really simple but the food is just incredible.if you are looking for a authentic Central American food this is the right place to eat.",1
SoCjdgcYyj05tSPWz6MUXg,"Delicioso!!  That just about sums up this place. I had it on my restaurant bucket list for the last two years and I should encourage you to not make the same mistake I did.  If you wait more than a couple weeks to go try some ridonculously delicious pupusas then, well, that's two weeks less of pupusas in your life.

Price:  All of the appetizers are ~$2, that's dang cheap.  My wife and I had 2 pupusas, 2 tacos, 2 tamales, and 2 horchatas for $17.  The regular dishes are still pretty cheap but we've yet to try them.

Food:  The pupusas are where it's at. The tamales weren't that great but tacos were awesome.  I can't wait to go try the rest of the menu.

Overall, I loved this place.  You probably need to speak Spanish to avoid any problems during your visit but I would imagine that pointing to the menu will get you by just fine if you have no questions or problems. 

It is a small little place with just a few staff and I love how authentic it is.  I plan on returning very soon.",1
SoCjdgcYyj05tSPWz6MUXg,"Mexican food in Cleveland may be garbage, but there is a least some really good Latin American food to be found.

The wife and I were on the west side and decided to give this place a try based on the reviews.  We are pretty big pupusa fans.  You can almost tell right away that this place. is the real deal based on a number of important factors: crappy stripmall location, non English speaking staff, uncomfortable unairconditioned environment, tables from different sets 20+ years old and a glass case full of very random crap for sale.  When it comes to authentic Latin food these are musts.

The pupusas here are large and delicious.  The fried plantains are a must have side.  The food is ordered sushi style with an order form with check boxes for items.  I definitely want to come back and try some of the entrees.  The only slight negative is that the horchata wasn't the best.  It was warm and tasted like that cheap mix you findin Mexican grocery stores... which it may well have been.  Best to stick to a nice Mexican coke.

If yout want to try actual authentic food and not Americanized bastardizations then please give this place a try.",1
SoCjdgcYyj05tSPWz6MUXg,"Excellent pupusas! The place definitely has authentic Salvadoran style and made food as good as what I've had in El Salavador. The pupusas a huge - 2 is easily a meal with some fried plantains on the side. The prices are very reasonable for the amount of food you get - the two of us ate for under $15! This isn't some place you go for a classy evening, but the quality of food definitely surpassed my expectations.
The only alcohol I saw was sangria in what looked like beer bottles - I'll have to give that a try that next time.",1
SoCjdgcYyj05tSPWz6MUXg,"Hole in the wall in a shady looking area ... will leave you smelling like fried food ... but the food is awesome!  You pay hole in the wall prices for authentic scratch cooking from El Salvador (I believe) ... pupusas are these great meat or cheese filled pan-fried 'pancakes' eaten with a refreshing salsa and spicy slaw.  We also get the steak tacos and fried plantains every time we go. 

We once ventured into the plates but both the chicken and fried pork belly entrees were way too dry for our liking - so we're sticking with the pupusas, tacos and plantains for future trips. 

Beware - limited English here, but that's fine because you place your order from paper menu order forms.",1
SoCjdgcYyj05tSPWz6MUXg,"You have to communicate in whatever Spanish that you might know or point to the menu really well. I've been here twice now and I've been satisfied each time. On weekends, this little hole in the wall is quite full. It doesn't really focus too much on setting (some might be turned off by it) and the patrons are mostly Hispanic - all good indicators of its authenticity. 

Food: while the pupusas are not listed in main entrees, a couple of those can be quite filling. This was my first time trying them and they were delicious. The coleslaw and tomato-y sauce balanced well with it. The beef tongue taco also stood out to me. I've had the fried tilapia dish and while it's good, it was a tad salty. I would stick to the smaller dishes that they're known for.",1
SoCjdgcYyj05tSPWz6MUXg,"Authentic and delicious.  Tamales wrapped in banana leaves, fantastic tacos, very flavorful refried beans.  And the pupusas are amazingly delicious.  They come with a spicy vinegar based cole slaw.  It just all works together.  The restaurant has a very small dining room and it is very casual.  There is an open kitchen so you can watch how they prepare some of the food.  They use fresh ingredients. One of the best authentic restaurants in the city.",1
SoCjdgcYyj05tSPWz6MUXg,"Very authentic and delicious!  I'm from Honduras so whenever I feel I want ""home"" food I just come here to grab a bite. Probably helpful if you have somewhat of a understanding of the Spanish language for the staff. If not just point at what u want in the menu.",1

SoCjdgcYyj05tSPWz6MUXg,I love this place. I really do. The food is wonderfully authentic. I look past the less than perfectly clean place and pretend I'm in El Salvador enjoying pupuses. However the wait time is ridiculous. I was told 25 minute wait for a dozen pupases. It's now been 55 minutes. Customers come in and out and I'm still waiting.,0

SoCjdgcYyj05tSPWz6MUXg,"Woohoo! Hole in the wall ethnic places! 

One of our  friends who happens to be Colombian loves to eat (and eat authentic foods), so after seeing the article written in the Plain Dealer, off we went for a Saturday brunch. 

Nestled in the middle of a small plaza, Pupuseria La Bendicion is definitely your hole in the wall place. Me like. I started off drinking the horchata la arroz... a sweet rice drink (they were both like, what! you've never tried it??), which I gave my thumbs up on.

We ordered pupusas- him the pork, our friend the cheese, and me, the flower one (I think it was loroco?).. and man, mine was the best, hands down. We ordered some eggs and beans with it..and even the eggs were cooked sooooo good.. so light and almost finely diced?? Our friend, he ordered the steak with eggs (there are more authentic names..I just can't remember)..and man, his plate was the best, hands down. 

We had our friend order for us, so that made life a lot easier, but nonetheless, a great place to stop if you're in the area and craving some Salvadorian food...... or just want to try it. Mmmmm. I like.",1
SoCjdgcYyj05tSPWz6MUXg,"Very good and authentic food.  You won't hear a lick of English spoken here...todo en Espanol.  The pupusas are delicious, and at $1.60 a shot, you can eat like a king for pennies on the dollar.  Steak tacos are okay (much prefer the ones at La Plaza Supermarket).  The platter with eggs, beans, fried platanos and a chicken tamale was delicious.  Now, for the chink in the armour...this place is filthy.  Many tables had dirty dishes on them and the bathroom was disgusting.  Just because the place is small and ethnic does not mean it has special license to be un-hygienic.  So either know that going into and turn a blind eye to it or don't go.",0
SoCjdgcYyj05tSPWz6MUXg,"Stopped here for a late lunch this weekend, thanks solely to all the raving reviews here on Yelp.

I've never been to El Salvador or eaten Salvadorian food anywhere else, so I can't speak to the authenticity, but everything we had was tasty.  My husband had some kind of combo dish with scrambled eggs, refried beans, a chicken tamale, fried plantains, and tortillas - all for $8.  I ordered a la cart, and got a bean and cheese papusa, a cheese and herb papusa, refried beans, and a steak taco.  They also brought out a bowl of red sauce and a bowl of some kind of slaw.  I'm not sure if everyone gets those or if they're meant to go with a certain item that we ordered.  My favorite things were the papusas, which are huge and an amazing value for $1.69 or whatever they charge.  

The worst part about this place is how dirty it seems.  It's been 3 days since we ate there and we didn't get sick, so the kitchen hygeine must not be too bad, but it just looked awful.  You have to pretty much walk through the kitchen to get to the bathroom, and I really wish I hadn't seen it.  The bathrooms were also gross.  That being said, there are probably plenty of other restaurants that are just as bad or worse, but I don't know bc I can't see inside the kitchen.

I enjoyed my meal and I'm glad we went, but I probably won't be back.  Partly because of the cleanliness and partly because it's not a very convenient location for me.  I would still recommend it to anyone who's looking for something new and interesting to try.",0
SoCjdgcYyj05tSPWz6MUXg,Huge portions and authentically delicious.  Definitely get a Papusa if you've never had one.  I've been to El Salvador and this place makes fish even better!,1
SoCjdgcYyj05tSPWz6MUXg,"Fantastic!  Cheap and delicious.  My son and I ate in, but it seems as though most people get takeout.  We got a lot of food for $13; we took a lot home.   My coworker is from El Salvador and she said the food is authentic.  Will return!",1
SoCjdgcYyj05tSPWz6MUXg,"Very cheap. Very authentic. I like combo 1 on the menu, huge amount of steak with very very delicious beans. I also tried the tilapia dish, didn't like it so much. It was just fried tilapia with some salad and rice on the side. Didn't seem that different from something that I can make my own. The food will take A WHILE to come so make sure you have plenty of time to spare. Also be prepared that the bathroom they have is not really usable. No lights in the bathroom, floor is super sticky. I didn't want to use it in complete darkness, plus there is no place to wash your hands. So prepare yourself before you go! Otherwise, a great, cheap place to get some authentic food without breaking your bank!",0
SoCjdgcYyj05tSPWz6MUXg,"Short version of my review for those of you who don't feel like reading the whole thing: food is good, but not worth it if don't have the time to spare. 

Stopped in here on a Friday afternoon for lunch since I happened to be in the area for a work obligation. The place is, as you probably expect, a very literal hole in the wall. When I walked in though, it was swarming with customers, many of whom had finished up eating and were just chatting with the staff. I waited in line quite a while to finally be handed a menu. I ended up having to go back, grab a table, glance at the menu, then wait in line again to order. So minus a few points for not having menus readily available or posted conspicuously on the wall. I realized immediately that my Spanish was about to come in handy- no one around me spoke a word of English, so I quickly ordered off the menu in very simple Spanish (success- the woman actually understood me!) for those of you without any Spanish speaking skills, you could probably just point to what you want on the menu, but if you want any modifications, good luck! 
I ordered two tacos carnitas, two different pupusas, and a horchata. I proceeded to go back to my table and wait as the woman indicated they would bring the food out. Well, they did bring the food out........but only after a whopping 30 minutes. Maybe I'm spoiled, but that seems like an awfully long time to wait for two tacos, two pupusas and a drink on a Friday lunch hour. I am sympathetic that this place seems to be family run, but I also noticed that there were only about 3 tables waiting for food (the rest were just camping after their meals). I do think they prepare the pupusas to order, so that could be why it takes longer than usual, but just something to keep in mind. 
The food itself was very good, although very rich for me personally. The tacos were perfect, but I would probably choose to get tacos elsewhere if I had the craving, only because there are many other places you can get tacos much faster if you're so inclined (La Plaza Supermarket comes to mind) The pupusas were delicious, but again, very rich. They are also much bigger than what I'm used to seeing in Pupuserias, the ones I've seen are about the size of a tea saucer, wheras these are the size of a small appetizer plate and bursting with fillings. The pollo con queso papusa was delicious, and would have been a very satisfying meal on its own, and a cheap one at that at only $1.90/ pupusa. The horchata was tasty, but really sweet for me personally. 

I also want to add that this place is not clean at all. Now this normally doesn't really bother me, but if you are in any way grossed out by unsanitary restaurants, do NOT come in here. The tables weren't wiped off in between customers, the walls and floors are covered in grime, and I don't even want to think about what the kitchen looks like behind the counter. While I was waiting in line, a 5 year old boy walked up to his mother, spat out a peppermint and told her he didn't like it. She gave a look as to say she was grossed out at the thought of taking the peppermint he had been sucking on out of his hand, so he just spat it out and set it on the service counter. The woman working up front I can only assume didn't see it, because she just left it there. As I said, I can take this all in stride, but may not be everyone's cup of tea. 

I left very full for not very much money, but honestly I don't really see myself coming in here unless I had the extra time on a Saturday morning or something. So all in all, I would recommend if you really want to try authentic El Salvadorian food, but I don't see this being a place I'd frequent very often.",0
SoCjdgcYyj05tSPWz6MUXg,"I wish I had two rating options for this one.  One for the stuff I liked & one for the stuff I didn't

I went here w/ das mann & the chilrens on Tuesday because I read how amazing & cheap this place was on the Yelp Review of the Day.  I walked out w/ a $50 food bill and some very interesting eats.

Dive - YES
Clean - EH (Don't use the bathroom)
Language Barrier - Heck yeah
Decent eats - Depends on your take.

The 14 year old man-child ordered steak.  (Me hungry, me want steak, me in growth-spurt).  The tween wanted chix.  I ordered a tamale, the yuca plate, and horchata.  Das mann ordered a tamale, two tacos, and some beans.  May I just say this Yuca was not the yuca I had had in my past.  While it was ok...it wasn't my thing; tasted like tater-tots.  The man-child LOVED these.  They were like giant french fries.  I wasn't expecting the huge chunks of pork on my yuca, but hey I don't read or speak Spanish, so what you get is what you get.  The tween's eyes exploded out of her head when she saw the huge-a-mongeous piece of Chicken on her plate.  The meals came out w/ a stack of home-made ultra-thick tortilla.  The tamales weren't the best I've ever had, but das mann love 'em.  The tacos, the tacos were amazing and incredilby fresh.  The cilantro & the lime!!!!  YUM!  Everything was really fresh.  The coleslaw was great and while the meal was very heavy you can't complain you didn't get more than enough to eat here.  May I just say, I don't know what they put in their beans but holy moly...these might have been the best refried beans EVAH!
While I wasn't expecting to drop $50, the kids did get some large portions of meat.  I guess for a family of four you can't really complain for $50.
If you decide to try the place out, go in with an open mind and enjoy the ultra-authentic food!",1
SoCjdgcYyj05tSPWz6MUXg,"I love ""Latin-style"" food and this was my first time trying Salvadoran cuisine. I searched Yelp, per usual, for some good Latin cuisine restaurants in the area and decided upon this restaurant! The reviews said it was delicious and inexpensive, which would make it a win-win in my opinion! And they were right!

I ordered our food ""para llevar"" (to-go) because my friend was teaching Taekwondo classes and then he was testing for his 5th Degree Masters Blackbelt. I knew the fella needed to eat and wouldn't have time if I didn't bring it to him!

I ordered us tacos, tamales (wrapped in banana leaves), platanos (plantains), tomato sauce & some kind of spicy coleslaw, pupusas (on which I believe the tomato sauce and coleslaw is supposed to go), and handmade fresh tortillas! The restaurant was busy with Spanish speaking customers enjoying their food with gusto, so I knew I chose an authentic restaurant! The staff was friendly and let me take my time deciding on our order. Because they were so busy, it did take a bit of time to get my food, but it was worth it!

Everything was really tasty, but my favorite of all was the pupusas! I tried them both plain and topped with the tomato sauce and spicy coleslaw. Either way, they are great, but I preferred them topped!

If you are ever in the Lakewood/Cleveland area, I recommend you try this restaurant!",1
SoCjdgcYyj05tSPWz6MUXg,"I adore tiny-little, unassuming ethnic joints like Pupuseria La Benedicion. 

When fellow yelpers call it a ""hole in the wall"".... they would be correct. So seriously? I'll tell you this straight outta the gate: do not go here if you're an ambiance snob or you're expecting a 5 star service treatment with hot towels and shit. You ain't getting it here.

What you will get:  
- fantastic, authentic cuisine at dirt cheap prices.
- smiles from the sweet ladies cooking that delicious food.
- a bit of a language barrier if you don't speak Spanish.
- the hilarity that ensues when the word ""PUPUSA"" comes out of your mouth.

Here. I'll make the experience easier for ya: 
Walk up to the counter. They'll hand you a slip of paper to mark down what you'd like. Hand it in. They'll cook it up. Help yourself to your drinks of choice in the refrigerator. They'll bring your food out to you in about 20 minutes or so. Go up to the counter and pay after you gorge. 

Must try:
- the yucca plate. Crispy fried potato-y deliciousness. With some super flavorful fried pork on top. 
- the steak tacos. Some of the best, most flavorful tacos I've had.
- mixed pupusa. 

Damn. I wish I lived closer.",1
SoCjdgcYyj05tSPWz6MUXg,"This place is truly a hole-in-the-wall! There's no signage outdoors (other than a misleading Gyro sign out in the parking lot) but the restaurant definitely doesn't need any marketing to keep itself busy. The place was packed at noon on Sunday, with plenty of people buzzing in and out for take-out.

For only $3.80 I was completely stuffed from a horchata drink (a nutty/cinnamon-y/milky beverage), a revueltas pupusa (stuffed with pork rinds, cheese, and refried beans...the beans definitely had a dominant taste), and a queso con loroco pupusa (suuuuper cheesy but still tasty). The pupusas were served with a side of cabbage slaw and tomato salsa, which were great complementary toppings.

Service was slow but it's such an authentic and delicious experience that it's worth the wait. I'll be back!",1
SoCjdgcYyj05tSPWz6MUXg,Found this place many years ago when it just opened. I've tried many of the newer places that have popped up around town but this is still the best by far. Very authentic no frills food.,1
SoCjdgcYyj05tSPWz6MUXg,"I am giving this place 5 stars based on uniqueness, authenticness, value. It's simple food but seems real and has good texture! And is unlike anything I've had before. Loved this little place! I ordered 2 pupusas, the pollo y queso and the lorrocco flower one. The lorocco flower looked like tiny chopped up asparagus IDK. BOth were good. I ordered a bean tamale and they said no. I couldn't quite understand why. No biggie!

Just know... Sometimes it's slow! They have to plant the corn, grow the corn, harvest the corn, turn it into pupusas... This takes time I suppose. I can't knock stars if food just takes time to prepare. I was the only one in there and 2 pupusas took 30 mins almost. 

I didn't think the place was dirty, IDK. MAybe I'm jaded. For my take out order they did include the slaw and tomato sauce in case anyone wondered. I'm no scientist but they put hot tomato ""salsa"" in a simple ziplock bag for take-out. Lol I do not care tho cause DOLLA NINETY! But wait there's more! You can also buy cologne from a display case while you wait. Maybe it's mouth cologne! Again! I'm no expert and I'm not salvadorian! 

Here's some menu pics.",0
SoCjdgcYyj05tSPWz6MUXg,"Overall I think this is a great place, however don't be fooled by its appearance. The food is very authentic Salvadorian and very good. Also if you happen to not speak Spanish, they have English menus.  They are very generous with the portion sizes and it's fairly charged. I def will visit again in the future to try some other items on the menu.",1
SoCjdgcYyj05tSPWz6MUXg,"This Salvadoran restaurant is a little known treasure in Cleveland.   They cook authentic pupusas filled with your choice of chicharrÁE³n (roast pork), chicken, beans and or cheese.  For those who are new to pupusas, a pupusa is a corn flour stuffed pancake filled with all kinds of goodies.  It is the pan fried on both",1
SoCjdgcYyj05tSPWz6MUXg,"I will keep up the 5 star reviews of this restaurant!

This place... is amazing! I first found out about it from my friend who heard about it from another friend. This El Salvadorian restaurant seems to be very authentic, and it attracts mostly Spanish-speakers. When my friends went, no one spoke English. When we went tonight, there was a waitress who did.

She handed us order forms (like at some sushi restaurants) and we were pleasantly surprised at the offerings and the prices! I ordered a steak taco and a loroco (herb) pupusa, which were both delicious!!! The plantain side was very plentiful... enough to share with a few people around. 

I will definitely be back for the steak tacos and the pupusas!! Craving it already...",1
SoCjdgcYyj05tSPWz6MUXg,"I'm Salvadorean and out of all the pupusa places in Cleveland this is my favorite. It has all the things I like: it's cheap, delicious and in my opinion it comes as close to authentic Salvadorean food as you can get in Cleveland at least.
My mom visited 2 years ago and I took her here, she said it was ok for Salvadorean food and for someone who was born in El Salvador and lived through the civil war that is a huge compliment.",1
SP7H3zPArNvbHKQW0c_gpA,Consistently delicious and authentic thai food. I'd suggest the crazy noodle. Cozy and calm atmosphere inside. One of my favorites!,1
SP7H3zPArNvbHKQW0c_gpA,"This place is absolutely delectable. I remember first coming to this place when it was first Mint Cafe and when they went under new management I was thinking that I was gonna be disappointed when they reopened. I was wrong. 

Everything is marvelous from the urban atmosphere to the food to the newly added sushi menu. Their service is fairly fast and they check on you frequently to make sure everything is to your liking. 

In regards to the food I have tried many things on the menu. The best appetizer is the seafood coconut soup and the best entree is kind of cliche but they have pretty good pad Thai. Instead of having to choose one meat or another they include the shrimp and chicken under the same price. The sushi may not seem authentic because it is in a Thai restaurant but don't let it fool you. It's absolutely delicious! 

Not the best Thai place I've been to but definitely worth trying out if you're a first time goer.",1
SP7H3zPArNvbHKQW0c_gpA,"Ok, the people who gave this place 3 or more stars, I have one question for you: do you really feel that the food here is spicy enough?  I don't.   As someone who has lived in Thailand (Bangkok specifically, for a short time), I found the food here to be really lacking in spice and authenticity.  I felt like everything had been de-spiced as if to say that just because you live in Cleveland, you don't like spicy.  We want our spice, high Thai'd, give us the spice, gotta have that spice!!

And I also found that the food here was more expensive than it needs to be.  $14 for a dinner portion of noddles with shrimp?  Really?",0
SP7H3zPArNvbHKQW0c_gpA,Kinda Meh. Dishes lack flavor and the vegetables tend to be a little overcooked. It seems very americanized and not very authentic thai tasting compared to what I've had elsewhere.  The service and the people are nice enough. It's just a little over-priced for what you're getting considering I think I could probably make something a little better at home.,0
SP7H3zPArNvbHKQW0c_gpA,"Quick, tasty, authentic, nice.  Awesome.",1
SP7H3zPArNvbHKQW0c_gpA,"This is the most authentic (and most delicious) Thai food in Cleveland. The service is pretty good, most menu items can be made vegetarian. All of the curries (especially the yellow and avocado curries) are hearty. You can substitute brown rice. I felt that the food was beautifully arranged as it was served with carrot flowers and slices of lime.",1
SP7H3zPArNvbHKQW0c_gpA,Really wanted Thai food and came here b/c several others were closed for Labor Day. Food was plentiful and hot. But no one was hardly in the restaurant and had to wait like 15-20 min for a seat. Ordered Spring Rolls and very bread no shrimp in them (despite the description). Had the Pad Thai and again very stingy on mediocre shrimp. Also the pad Thai was sweet??  Probably will not come back but you might enjoy it if you haven't experience authentic Thai food. Server was nice.,0
sRqlwSng2nHqTZuggX__Mw,"We recently had the pleasure of going to Wilberts after an Indians game. One of the locals recommended it. I'm glad he did. It is a truly authentic local bar with knowledgable bartenders that are fast, friendly, and willing to go the extra mile. The owner was nice enough to give us 2 tshirts and prepare us a shot. There is a live band and very nice crowd. I'd definitely recommend this little gem. From 2$ beers to chocolate martini's u can't go wrong. We had a wonderful time.",1
sS5-UR5I1N_JZx8UGt5xGg,"I personally enjoyed the Blue Bar, but I'm also not entirely sure they are owned by the same people from when I visited back in 2016.  At the time, the atmosphere was pretty chill, the bar was fairly modern, & it was conveniently located in the lobby of our hotel - Wyndham Cleveland.  The hotel MAY have rebranded to the Crown Plaza since then.

Regardless, the drinks were pretty good & they had some fairly authentic Poutine!  I'm a sucker for any restaurant that has Poutine on the menu, but being within walking distance of Playhouse Square & most of the noteworthy restaurants downtown really helped too.  I really enjoy having the option to drink & not having to drive.

What none of the reviewers mention here, is that they also have a pretty killer breakfast at the Blue Bar as well.  It's free if you stay at the hotel, but I can't imagine it being too expensive outside of that either.  They had their own omelet station with a chef present to prepare your food, along with a buffet featuring a number of other common breakfast standards.  Juice & coffee seemed to be complimentary.",1
ss978X4omzcJjIeq6K-kag,"Great Place, as far as I am concerned the most authentic pizza in Cleveland",1
ss978X4omzcJjIeq6K-kag,"I'm teetering on the brink of four stars, but can't bring myself to do it due to the weird atmosphere and service. With some improvement, though this place could definitely earn another star or two, since the food is already there. 

If you like unique pizzas that retain their classic pizza foundation, come here. The flavors are unique and fresh, but not too crazy to lose the ""pizza"" title. 

These pizzas are delightful! We got the regular pepperoni and the pancetta and egg by suggestion from our server. The pepperoni was definitely good and had a good authentic homemade taste to it. No doughy, greasy waxy cheese mess. It was like the homemade pizza you make at home, except the work part was cut out. Perfect! The pancetta and egg was a definite stretch for me at first. I'm not a fan of the ""put an egg on it"" fad. Eggs on burgers, eggs on hot dogs, eggs on pizzas. I like eggs. I like eggs on eggs (hollandaise, what?! YES.). But eggs on top of anything else? With oozing yolk all over the rest of my dish? Ehhh...But, I put our second pizza choice in the hands of our polite server and he said that was his favorite. I figured there's no better time than the present, what with the end of the world near and all, so we went for it. WOW. I was pleasantly surprised and immediately converted (to egg on pizza...the others will have to wait). The egg added a great burst of flavor to the rich pancetta. It was wonderful! 

I'd definitely recommend giving this place a try. Upon walking in, it can be a little off-putting and confusing, though. The service seems inconsistent. While our server was nice and gracious, when we walked in, it was unclear whether we were to seat ourselves or not and we had to wait a LONG time for our bill, then a long time to pay it and we ended up walking it downstairs...completely unsure of whether this was what we were expected to do or not. Very confusing and strange set up. I definitely got a slow and cold, but not quite ""depressing"" vibe from the interior as well. The space is way too big for their quaint little mod-pizza parlor theme they're going for. They need to close up the empty wall space and perhaps get rid of the cold metallic decor and atmosphere. Really, I think the place could use some sprucing, but the pizzas are delicious enough to bring me back.",1
ss978X4omzcJjIeq6K-kag,"Vero is a fascinating spot I have came across during my sampling of authentic Napoletana styles pizzas. It lies not far away from the Little Italy of Cleveland, a city that I did not excite me thus far in terms of culinary experiences. 
Enter Vero pizza on a weekday evening, one of our companions was sick, we decided to take out a couple of pies from here. As we ask for a take out menu, the hostess announces that they are a strict dine-in restaurant only. When I urge them to consider the fact that we have a people waiting back home, would love their pizza, she refuses to budge. On inquiring if they do not have boxes, she says we can box pizzas only after eating our share of the order. We  refuse and leave the place for the day.

A day after, we plan our dinner only with people who can physically be present in the restaurant. Quaint little place, pretty packed with seating on 2 levels. Got their cauliflower and olives for appetizer, average and nothing to rave or complaint about. Their milk and honey pizza with a farm egg was brilliant. Their margherita pie was great too, authentic crust, quality ingredients, tasty sauce, and exactly what a smashing Napoletana should be. 4 star for their pizzas. Got a pistachio gelato (to-go) at the end and that is something I thought was one of the best pistachio gelatos I have ever had. Bump up to a 5-star for the pizzas and gelato. Down a star for the stupid no 'take-out' policy. Down another star for not just conjuring stupid policies but enforcing them on the citizens of the free word craving an authentic Napoletana. Come on guys, heal the world and let out pies in a town with patients (think Clevand clinic) and university students. Its not enough if you do good, you gotta box it up, if not deliver it to the world !",0
ss978X4omzcJjIeq6K-kag,Order the house salad and bread!! The pizza's are made in a REAL authentic wood fired oven!,1
ss978X4omzcJjIeq6K-kag,"Coming from New York, I was utterly disappointed in the pizza selection in the greater Cleveland area.  The bulk of it consists of prefrozen, fast food style pies.  However, Vero Bistro is the only place to go if you want fresh, authentic, flavorful pizzas made from local ingredients.  Their pizzas top some of the best I've had back home and make it easily the best pizza I've ever eaten.  You can always expect a slightly different menu depending on the season, paired with an equally impressive selection of italian gelato.  Vero is reasonably priced for what you get. ( I also recommend the Bruschetta appetizer as it's always phenomenal.)",1
ss978X4omzcJjIeq6K-kag,"Finally, an authentic Italian pizza in Cleveland. It is delicious. Period.  We could not stop talking about how much it reminded us about pizza in Italy.  We also had Burratta and house salad which were very impressive.  We will definitely be back.

Only negative might be the gelato, but that probably has more to do with me picking ""cereal milk"" flavor than anything else.  Chocolate and vanilla with chocolate chips were much better than what I picked...I should have known to stick with the tried and true favors.  

I'll be back.  No question",1
ss978X4omzcJjIeq6K-kag,"I'm not sure why there are so many haters for this place.  My wife and I came to visit at the recommendation of some Italian friends and really enjoyed this place.  Great crust, simple, good ingredients and a nice gelato chaser.  We also enjoyed a fresh, simple salad.  The young man who was serving us was friendly and attentive.  This is one of the better authentic pizza places in Cleveland, I think.  I will be back.  My only complaint is that I wish that there were more fruit flavored gelato choices, like back in the Gelateria days.  Oh well, maybe there will be more next time.",1
ss978X4omzcJjIeq6K-kag,"They have the best wood fired pizza in Cleveland. They use high quality, authentic ingredients and their crust is absolutely perfect. Just the right amount of crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. And I love that they use fresh seasonal ingredients like ramps in their specials. Seriously, their chef is a genius in the kitchen. If you haven't checked it out yet, you're missing out.",1
ss978X4omzcJjIeq6K-kag,"Nice and cozy. Food is delicious. If you are in the mood for an authentic thin crusted, wood oven pizza, that's the place to go.",1
ss978X4omzcJjIeq6K-kag,"On suggestion from Scene mags, very positive review or Vero, we tried it one Saturday night.  One key point the article missed, was that in lieu of the fact that they don't currently have a liquor license, you CAN bring your own wine! And they provide the glasses and corkscrew! NO CORKAGE FEE!
Now on to the pizza....it was delicious!  We had  two, (as they are only about 11"" pies) The pancetta with egg, and the Capriciossa.   The pancetta with egg was our favorite, but it's a weekly featured pie, and not always available.  

The dough is sweet and delicious, not a pan pizza, and not over loaded with cheese.  These are authentic Napoletana pizzas. They have a distinct  way of being cooked and served, and  as the owners will tell you, best consumed on the premises.

There are salads, and other small plates available on the menu, which all sounded mouth-watering.    Definitely going to try next time.

And don't expect to get a huge pizza, loaded to the brim, with cheese and toppings.  Think Quality vs Quantity!

You'll be very satisfied!",1
ss978X4omzcJjIeq6K-kag,"Wood fired, stone oven, the freshest of authentic ingredients and a true master of pizza. This is how pizza SHOULD be made!! Salads are and now a wine bar!! Service is attentive and involved as well as helpful. Above all try the Margarita DOP!",1
ss978X4omzcJjIeq6K-kag,"Loved the atmosphere here! I had the house wine, Margherita pizza, and cardamon Gelato! Everything was absolutely delicious and it definitely reminded me of when I was in Rome! Very fresh ingredients and definitely the most authentic Italian pizza in cleveland! I suggest making a reservation so you don't have to wait, but it is worth the wait if you have to!",1
ss978X4omzcJjIeq6K-kag,"Last time I ate there was 7 months ago or so.  Love the place each time...sometimes service can be a tad slow.  I hear they have a wine list and am heading there right now.

Great authentic pizza.",1
ss978X4omzcJjIeq6K-kag,"Still the best pizza in the area

Vero Bistro is as authentic as you will find pizza in the University-circle/little italy area, and there is definitely something to appreciate about that.
Having been to Italy where I was fortunate enough to experience the fine art of pizza making by master Italian chefs, I can say that the pizza fired up at Vero Bistro takes me back to the summer of 11'.

With their one of a kind wood-burning oven, Vero Bistro provides a unique rustic flare to their Napolean pizza that is not offered elsewhere in Cleveland. Crispy yet chewy crust, with a gooey center, and just the right amount of burn marks all around, just the way pizza is in Italy.

Ingredients: 
Red sauce: San marzano tomatos (a type of plum tomato that is known for their intense flavor) are used, and an added plus, the ones used at Vero are shipped from Italy! The sauce is kept relatively simple to preserve the tomato-y taste that should be pizza sauce. 4/5

Cheese: I've had their margherita before. Small balls of mozzarella decorate the pizza. Although I personally prefer fewer, but bigger pieces of mozzarella, it's nothing to hold against them, but I've definitely had higher quality mozzarella. However, the parmesan reggiano used on some of their pizzas (asparagus special) is delicious. 4/5

Crust: Need I say more? This is the way pizza crust should be. What you want in a good pizza is a rustic, smokey crust where each bite is slightly different from the last. It may take someone who has eaten real Italian pizza to truly appreciate this crust.
In my mind, this is easily the best element of Vero Bistro's pizza. I also like the light sprinkle of salt on the crust. 5/5

Vero Bistro is newly renovated restaurant (formerly La Gelateria), and the new chic interior design is the perfect setting for enjoying their pizza. With their heavy duty metallic chairs, and beautiful thick wooden tables, the decor complements the rustic feel that is Vero Bistro perfectly.

Overall: 5/5

I almost forgot to mention the gelato. Creamy, rich, delicious. I especially enjoy the pistachio. Support a young restaurant! Give Vero Bistro a try, I promise you will not regret your experience.

Additional note: they very recently changed their menu to a smaller, more pizza-focused one. Restaurants with smaller menus tend to be more consistent and use fresher ingredients.

ss978X4omzcJjIeq6K-kag,"So far, this is the best pizza I have enjoyed in Cleveland so far! We ordered 2 pizzas, both came to our table hot and freshly made with a perfect thin crust, excellent toppings and flavor combinations. They tasted like the real wood fire grilled pizzas from the authentic Italian pizza ovens that I sampled during my Italian travels. Of course, it's on the pricier side, but this typically comes with great quality and service. To me, the prices were fair. The restaurant had a clean, new, updated feel to contrast the old brown buildings of the Cleveland Heights shopping area where it is located. I will definitely return and will be craving their pizza until the time I do!",1
ss978X4omzcJjIeq6K-kag,A successful conversion of the former La Gelateria in my opinion.  Kept the gelato and added very authentic Napoletano stye wood-fired pizza.  I'm not a fan of dining in here; however it is always an option for carry out or a table outside.,1

ss978X4omzcJjIeq6K-kag,"After coming back from Italy I thought it would be a long time before being able to experience authentic Italian pizza once more. When I heard there was a place in 
Cleveland with a wood burning oven I had to check it out! Vero Bistro successfully filled the empty spot in my stomach craving that great style of pizza. Cooked to perfection their Margherita with fresh mozzarella and a touch a basil and olive oil sent my taste buds to heaven. The service was outstanding and the young gentlemen was quite humorous. After the pizza, I had Gelato that in my opinion was better than that in Italy. The Pistachio was to die for! If your looking for a small, nice place to go out to get some real Italian pizza and gelato this is the place!",1
ss978X4omzcJjIeq6K-kag,"Delicious, fresh Neapolitan pizza. If you need more bread and cheese before your pizza (be honest), the seasonal variation on burrata is always a great idea. Best pizza on the east side, if not Cleveland. We usually go with three pies (two red and a white) and take a couple slices home.
If you like amazing, authentic pizza - this is your spot!",1
ss978X4omzcJjIeq6K-kag,"I've been hearing good things about Vero Pizza since it opened, and was excited to try it. We arrived a few minutes before 5pm on a Friday and were seated right away as a group of 5. There was only one other group waiting when we arrived, but by 6pm the were pretty full. There also isn't much room for waiting, so just something to keep in mind if you have a larger group or are coming at a burger time and it's cold outside. 

We started out with some drinks, and our server was nice enough to help us navigate the drink menu. They only have 2 type of beers (bottled) and they were out of one of them.

We tried their salumi, soppressata, bianca, and best pizzas and all had delicious flavors! Their pizzas are thin crust that's slightly chewy (probably a bit too chewy for me, but everyone else liked it). They cut the pizzas into 4 pieces right at your table, which is a nice touch. They recommend 1 pizza per person, but, as a group of 5, we probably could have split 3-4 pizzas and perhaps tried one of their appetizers. It did take about 20 min to get our food, which seemed like a while given that they weren't particularly busy when we first got there. 

We ended with their gelato, which was also delicious (and servings are big enough to split)! They have about a dozen flavors to choose from. Having eaten a pizza and a big bowl of gelato, I definitely left feeling full!

Overall, a great addition to the Cedar-Fairmont area. Their pizzas are unique and definitely have a more authentic feel to them. The crust was a bit too chewy for me, to the point where I might call it soggy, but that's just me. Would be happy to come here again, especially at a time where we don't have to wait. Can't go too wrong with pizza, wine, and gelato!",1
ssyjN-SqT2O8jlC8IvrH-w,"Rude service would be ok if the baked goods were exceptional. High prices would be ok if the baked goods were a taste of Italy. Has anyone who works at this bakery tasted a cannoli in Sicily or a sfogliatella in Naples? Has anyone who gave this high-priced tourist trap four or five stars ever been to a pastry shop anywhere in the south of Italy? 

The $1.75 each mini cannoli were meh. Cannoli filled with chocolate chips and ricotta? Not in Sicily, paesano. The sfogliatelle were filled with grainy, lumpy gloop that was supposed to be delicate pastry cream. The sfogliatelle we bought were tough and chewy not light and crispy. The food of Neapolitan aristocracy sold in this bakery is little more than an insult to Napoletani who've made these pastries famous.

In your search for authentic Italian pastries walk on by this place.",0
ssyjN-SqT2O8jlC8IvrH-w,"What an adorable little bakery! 

Comapred to Presti's, it's worth pointing out that they put the filling in their canolis at Corbos after you order it, which is neat. They are also much more anise-flavored. To me, that's not appealing, but most people seem to prefer it so - there you go. It's up to personal preference on that one. 

This place isn't going to have anything really savory like Presti's - it's all cookies and cakes, basically. But they know what they're doing. The cookies are always awesome and the staff is always friendly. 

I have yet to be let down by the food here. Like I said before, it's just a bakery, not a cafe or lunch spot, so they seem to put a good amount of focus on making the sweets authentic and awesome. I still like Presti's, as well, and basically go back and forth between these two places. I love them both! Definitely worth a trip.",1
ssyjN-SqT2O8jlC8IvrH-w,"This place is authentic and does Italian
Pastry right!!!! I first went to the bakery down the street and left as I felt it wasn't ""authentic""... thankfully, while strolling I happened upon Corbos and am so happy I did. I knew when I walked in it was a true Italian bakery based on the products they carried.  It was as if I were in the Bronx. (Where I'm originally from). I ordered a svogliatelle,plain cannoli and just had to have an impromptu chocolate Italian ice.  The svogliatelle was light and crispy and savory and amazing.  The cannoli was stuffed as we waited...(the proper way to avoid a soggy shell) ... and the chocolate ice reminded me of my childhood. The service was warm and welcoming!  We even received a bonus chocolate cannoli as the server was excited for us to try how good it was!! If you're looking for authentic, Italian pastry and products this is your place.  So happy to have found it today.",1
SVCUA3QkgAvSxs84KMGOew,"Good and quick food. If you want super authentic pho and the best pho in Cleveland, I'd head to Superior Pho, but Pho and Rice is also tasty and has a wider variety of options. 

They make a mean crab rangoon and the hot and sour soup is definitely a star. I also really like their iced coffee bubble tea. There are a ton of bubbles and I like how it tastes a bit more like coffee than condensed milk. My friends ordered taro bubble tea, which I don't always see and which made me pretty excited. If you haven't had it, I highly recommend trying it. It's like lavender milk! 

Overall, very solid pho options and a good place to come with a diverse group because of all the non-pho options, such as pad thai and various other noodle based dishes. The service is quick and staff is friendly, which is always a plus in my book.",1
SVCUA3QkgAvSxs84KMGOew,"It's a simple, authentic and cozy neighborhood restaurant. I had noodles with grilled chicken and was pretty satisfied. I was expecting a bigger portion of noodles, though. My husband had udon with beef, and said beef was too hard to chew, but the broth was delicious. Food was fresh and prices were fair. Next time, I will try the subs!",1
SVCUA3QkgAvSxs84KMGOew,"I like this place a lot. My wife and I often go into chinatown and eat at #1 Pho or Superior Pho. I don't think Pho & Rice is quite as authentic but it's very close. The Pho Tai is fantastic and the broth is extremely tasty. Best of all, there is no solvent smell like in that other vietnamese restaurant on superior.

Highly recommended.",1

SVCUA3QkgAvSxs84KMGOew,Truly not interested in throwing this place under the bus love Vietnamese food but was disappointed ..wish they could take a lesson from Min ahn which is a favorite for many many years of mine! Poor ventilation so grease smell as soon as they dropped in our fried  tofu appetizer ..small portions unimpressive until adding sriracha and plum sauce which helps anything taste better! I suggest you hire the real deals in the kitchen to do the cooking ; not that you aren't authentic; just so so...wish you good luck/future!,0
SVCUA3QkgAvSxs84KMGOew,"It was my first Pho. Generous portions. A bit underwhelmed with the flavor.

My partner's rice and chicken was fantastic. I would order it again in a heartbeat.

Vietnamese coffee was authentic and slurpalicious. It could have used more condensed milk to be even more authentic. Lol.

I wanted mango sticky rice but we were stuffed. Next time.

Prices are fair with very generous portions.

Very busy little joint.",1
SVCUA3QkgAvSxs84KMGOew,This the best thai's noodle in cleveland.  The beef noodle and yen-ta-fo taste authentically just like in thailand . papaya salad and sticky rice are another of my favorites.,1
SVCUA3QkgAvSxs84KMGOew,Delicious and authentic pho. Cute little shop with friendly and quick service. Perfect for a chilly day or a refreshing Thai iced tea on a hot summer day. Reasonably priced. Definitely a great place to stop while you're in Coventry!,1
SVCUA3QkgAvSxs84KMGOew,"Super authentic in regarding to Thai food! They don't play around with spicy food. If the food has 2 chill sign, it means very spicy. I could not handle the drunken noodle because it was too spicy but so good. I just wish the server would have warned me how spicy it was, because 2 chili sign for the other restaurants were never that spicy. I was grasping for water. I also got some fish patties. The fish patties had this lime taste that was very interesting to me. I was not used to it. Don't get me wrong, the fish patties were super delicious. I just dumbfounded with this new lime taste like I couldn't place it in my taste dictionary. The sauce that went with the fish patties was sweet. I would love to put some lime to the sauce to make it a bit sour. I love sweet and sour taste. My friend got the pork noodle soup. It was yummy. The soup tasted similar to the noodle soup I got in Vietnam. I know Vietnamese and Thai cuisines are different. It just the noodle soup reminded of the food I ate in Vietnam. Furthermore, I didn't like their Thai tea since I prefer using condensed milk over regular milk + sugar in my Thai tea. I will check out their other dishes next time",0
sWRALTHK1SO0-bsWeWWyQw,I've been living in Cleveland for five years and have been to hundreds of bars in the area. This is my favorite. It's authentic Cleveland to me. It's message is simple: bring to you unique and high quality beers and great customer service. They did a great job of renovating the place and I'm sure it will be a catalyst for development in the area. They bring in great food from local vendors and they even have a comedy night. But most of all: their beer is good. It's worth checking out if you're in the area or just want to have a good time.,1
SYOzI_Ooe-rXI3ZqCybwSQ,The meatloaf reminds me of home cooking and the white trash burger is awesome. It's a cute little diner with a nice variety of food (for being a diner). My only complaint is the servers could be more friendly and attentive.,1
SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA,"I had a great meal and dining experience at L'Albatros.  I was traveling for business and a physician I was working with and the shuttle driver, Amy, at the Courtyard Marriott, highly recommended the restaurant. 

I sat at the bar and this was a great decision because Gillian, bartender / server extraordinaire, provided excellent service, food and drink recommendations and interesting conversation.  

L'Albatros has a great selection of French, American wines as well as, wine from other locations around the world. 

I started with the Braised Leeks with Dijon Mustard Sauce and the dish was excellent.  You don't see leeks on the menu in the US like you do in France.  They were served cold on top of very good dijon dressing.

Next, I ordered the Radish and Cucumber Les Salades over mache with red onions and crÁE¨me fraÁE®che vinaigrette.  The salad was very good and different than something I would normally order.  The rest of the salads on the menu looked amazing too.  

For the main course, I thought that the Seared Sea Scallops with brussel sprouts, noodles and Pernod cream sounded good, but I didn't want noodles.  Gillian suggested substituting the noodles with hericot verts (green beans).  That was a great suggestion and I think should be a permanent option.  It is also cool that the bartender at a French restaurant in Cleveland has lived in France and speaks French.  (added bonus for authenticity)

I was planning on skipping dessert but the CrÁE¨me Caramel was highly recommen",1
SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA,"Went here with a group of people and half of us got the duck confit. It was a pretty disappointing dish. The portion was large but the duck meat was stringy and tough. The skin wasn't fully rendered and was sitting in a saucy bed of cabbage and got soggy. None of us finished our dishes. It just wasn't authentic or tasty. I did enjoy the French onion soup, which had inside with hearty chunks of tender beef--that was a tasty surprise. 

The ambiance of the restaurant was nice, but won't be going back. Service was good--no complaints there!",0
SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA,"The food was fine. Authentic I suppose. I am perhaps spoiled having spent a large amount of time in France. I do understand the ""bistro"" style of this location. 
I will say that to be quite honest with you, very few if any of the cheeses were French. The fromagier had little idea about the cheeses and could not answer as to why they were not authentically French. This aside, I do understand that some cheeses may be difficult to get due to season, availability etc. However, the restaurant should not proclaim itself to be serving  authentic French cuisine of the blue cheese comes from Italy and there is Gouda on the menu.",0
SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA,"We are out-of-town visitors from New York City and consider ourselves foodies...  we also spend a lot of time in the south of France.  This restaurant offers truly authentic south-west French cooking, with many choices not often found in the us.  We ordered the French toast with wild mushrooms appetizer, a savory dish that was exquisite... and for the main course  the short ribs and cassoulet... both perfection.   

What also impressed us was the wine list.  Great choices, reasonable prices... try a BANDOL and discover a new region of France.

... now all we have to do is hope that the Cavaliers win the NBA championship and pull off a miracle",1
SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA,"Here's the short of it: Just because it has beans and meat in it doesn't make it cassoulet. But they *will* argue that point...

The details: 

We came here on the high ratings in Yelp and the fact that they serve cassoulet. We sat down and prepared to order drinks. I was looking to enjoy a good French beer -- after all, this is a fairly large French restaurant, and they should carry at least the most popular beer in France, Kronenbourg 1664. Wrong. One oddball French beer, that's all they had in that category. Lots of unknown craft beers and that type of thing. You may like that. I opted for a red Bordeaux instead. OK... it was good...

Next we chose the goat cheese tart and a mixed-greens salad. These both were absolutely exceptional! I don't know why that salad was so good, but it was fresh and crisp and dressed with just the tastiest vinaigrette. My wife, who had the tart, echoed the sentiments of another Yelper, who said they would weep like a baby if that tart was ever taken off the menu. (Great line.) So, so-far-so-good.

When we ordered our main courses I noticed that the cassoulet had lamb as one of the meats. Who puts lamb in cassoulet?? I've had it several times in France, and NOBODY there would ever do that! In fact, I'd dare say you would be laughed at if you did. Each chef creates it differently, but they all stick to the same basic ingredients. I'm not a fan of lamb anyway, so I asked if they could substitute a chunk of pork, which is traditional in this dish. To their credit, they said they would see what they had to substitute.

That should have been a clue -- real cassoulet is baked for hours and the meats are integrated under the crust that forms from the white beans and broth; it's like a stew, and it would be difficult to change-out anything inside. But I missed that clue and ordered the dish.

(Rant coming...)

So the ""cassoulet"" arrives in a few minutes, way too few beans for the amount of meat in it, soupy broth, no crust - and what really matters, it was just ""meh"". One of the sausages was really good. The duck leg was decent. But everything else was pretty boring, especially since the savory stew-like broth and beans were essentially missing. That would have carried the dish.

When the server asked how I liked it, I told her that it wasn't what I expected and wasn't so good. A bit later a woman who was apparently the manager came over to the table and I told her the same thing. She explains how they don't prepare the cassoulet traditionally; they cook the beans separate and add the meat just before serving -- so they won't run out of the dish, she says. Well, OK... but it was still not real tasty. Is that explanation supposed to reverse my experience of it??  There was no offer to make it right -- in fact, it was like she argued that I was wrong for not liking it. She smiled the whole time but never acknowledged my experience. I guess that's what 4 1/2 stars on Yelp does to your attitude.

My wife, who worked at a Marriott restaurant for years, said that she would never argue nor allow any dissatisfaction from her customers -- it was always replaced with something else that the customer wanted, or they were compensated in some way. *That's* real customer service.

And as for her dish, the mussels she ordered were good for what they were, but, again, they didn't have much of anything in the broth to make them great. No ""wow"" factor.

So from incredible starters to ""meh"" entrees, with an attitude. That's why three stars. Minus-one for the attitude, and the fact that if you go to a French restaurant, you ought to get authentic French food, not some convenient fusion someone dreams up...

I hope you fare better.",0
SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA,"Sorry L'Albatross, but I can tell you don't have authentic french food. A little french bird told me that this restaurant wasn't worth the price, wasn't authentic, and wasn't tasty. 

I had their waleye special and the pistachio cake. The waleye special was good, but definitely not worth the price. C'mon, thirty dollars for a small portion of bottom feeder fish? The pistachio cake tasted like it came straight from walmart, but they added some more sugar on top to make the cake look more appetizing.  It wasn't, so don't bother. 

The service was... Memorable. Our waitress was attentive, but seemed cheerful to the point that she came off as fake. If I cracked a terrible joke, she laughed along loudly despite the joke not being funny. I could see the look of dismay cross my boyfriend's face every time I joined in on the fakery. Though I'd rather have a fake nice waitress than a crabby one. 

Parking is not good. Expect to pay several dollars of valet parking. L'Albatross is located on campus near a bunch of frat houses. You can't miss all the elderly, well-dressed men and women that make up almost the entirety of L'Albatross's customer base. If you're young, you'll have a bout of imposter syndrome when you walk in. They have a coat check, so do stop by the coat room across from the hostess.",0
SzcCJJmreMlWCsNjupdVAA,"I think this place worths your money. The portion size is huge. I had to pack half of my dish to go. I ordered the cassoulet. It smelled so good. However, I think they should let the meats bath in the sauce for a few more hours so the meats could infuse all the deliciousness of the sauce. I'm not sure if it's authentic so I let people who are more familiar with French cuisine to comment about their authenticity. The bread was too chewy for me. I honestly didn't find anything special about it. However, the servers were very attentive. That was nice!",0
T2JwvV8hH15KbnS1OCnrJg,"Super delish! Service is also very attentive. My husband and I ordered Tom Yam Soup, Somtam Salad with shrimp and Pla Pad Cha.

After 5 pm, you can park at the Monroe Brake shop nearby, which is very convenient. Overall it is excellent. Will absolutely go back again very soon.",1
T2JwvV8hH15KbnS1OCnrJg,"I moved here from NYC where I've had some really GREAT authentic Thai food. I was pleasantly surprised when I ordered from Thai Elephant and their food was equally as delicious! My go to order is their pineapple fried rice, pad thai and a green bubble tea. This is one of my favorite meals in Cleveland. I've also tried their red curry, and it's perfect. I like how you can choose from five levels of spicy-ness when you order from an app. Excellent food, Thai Elephant! I'll be ordering from you again soon!",1
T2JwvV8hH15KbnS1OCnrJg,"What a bummer!!! DO NOT EAT HERE. We were so excited to have some good Thai Elephant take out for dinner last night, we ordered our usual favorites sans the noodle dishes, Chicken Satay, Tom Yum soup and some cold spring roles. When we brought the food home and started looking through it-something seemed off. My boyfriends chicken satay looked rubbery and small, with no charring from the grill, our cold rolls were missing shrimp and the appearance of anything fresh and were served with a  honey sauce..wheres the hoison sauce? and my tom yum soup appeared to be murky in color and had a bad smell of too much fish sauce used. Then it hit us, like a ton of bricks, this was no longer Thai Elephant and no longer the same standard and authenticity of great Thai food. This was the first time in my life I returned take out food. Brown Sugar Thai will be getting all our business!",0
T2JwvV8hH15KbnS1OCnrJg,Spicy garlic chicken was amazing just like being in Thailand.  Everything they cook is always delicious I had the pork and basil last time.

The curry had good Essenes of coconut milk and the dried red pepper and cashew had a great smokey flavor that mixed well with the white rice.  

I've not found better close bye so if I'm in ""need"" of decent Thai food I'll be back.

T4JGbW9XEGQVrLpQcNFXtA,"I was excited to visit this restaurant since it was recommended by Michael Ruhlman. I lived in Japan for 5 years and traveled throughout South East Asia extensively; China, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand and have enjoyed much authentic Chinese cuisine. I was underwhelmed by this restaurant. The food was ok, the decor was lacking and the service was so so.",0
T4JGbW9XEGQVrLpQcNFXtA,"This little place is a top-notch restaurant, and in my opinion, is the best Chinese food one can obtain in the Cleveland area outside of Chinatown.  Although it serves a lot of the standard American-Chinese fare, it does it well, and it serves a number of items that venture into the realm of authenticity, including a few specials and random things that I have not ever seen elsewhere.  The menu is separated effectively into Szechuan, Mandarin, and Cantonese cuisine, which is a nice touch.

The quality?  It's consistently excellent.  The food is flavorful and balanced, made with fresh ingredients.  Everything here has a certain dash of novelty that makes this restaurant unique.  And it's very reasonably priced.

The service is always very good.  The people who work here (it's a small family business) are incredibly sweet.

This is one of my favorite restaurants on Cleveland's east-side and I think it is often overlooked and under-appreciated.",1
T4JGbW9XEGQVrLpQcNFXtA,"Let me just start by saying customer service is everything. When it comes to pleasing customers they don't fall short a bit.

We tried the ham egg foo yung with fried rice, chicken lo mein, house fried rice, and egg rolls.
Everything was fresh and the taste was authentic. 
Chinese is my favorite and I could eat it everyday. However, the Chinese in my area has been falling short. I can't say the same about SunLuck and their NEW MANAGEMENT!

The restaurant was also very clean which is most important to me. 

Also, they will be switching over to a new lower price menu in about two weeks.",1
T4JGbW9XEGQVrLpQcNFXtA,"the fat Asian waiter there was rude.  My dish was very salty and has the disgusting MSG sweet flavor that made me very thirsty! Hate the place!

And you get a clue if you don't see any Chinese in the Chinese restaurant.  Most dishes are too sweet and way overpriced!

Don't tell me they have authentic Chinese food because they don't!",0
T4JGbW9XEGQVrLpQcNFXtA,"So my parents are in town visiting this week and being Chinese, they prefer to eat Asian food in general. This place is right across the street from where I live, so, being new to the area as well, I suggest we try this place.
When we walk in, I immediately start to doubt my decision. Although most of the table are occupied, which is generally a good sign, they are all occupied by middle aged white American people. When we are greeted by a white college guy who is our server, I start to think of ways that we can get out of here without looking ridiculous.
Unfortunately, my dad convinces us to stay.

Oh I forgot to mention, my family is all vegetarian.
So they have quite a few vegetarian options, which is one of the reasons I wanted to go in the first place. 
My dad starts with the hot and sour soup, which he says is decent.
I have a veggie eggroll, which is pretty average.
We went on the have the Vegetarian Kung Pao, Vegetarian Hawphen, and Dark Tofu with Oriental Vegetables.
I don't even know where to begin. It's hard to say that they weren't authentic, because the dishes were very home style cooking. Like something you'd find in some small village where the mom doesn't know how to cook and just throws things together. The main problem with all the food was how ridiculously sweet everything was. It all just tasted like someone accidentally spilled a whole cup of sugar in it. There was definitely lots of MSG, which I'm fine with in small quantities, but some other people aren't.
Yeah it was like eating candy laced with MSG.

On another note, the service was quite good. The college boy was actually quite attentive, professional, and funny. An older Asian lady came out, presumably the owner or chef, and asked how everything was.

Overall, I'd come back here again if I were really desperate and lazy, because I could make the same caliber of food from here in my own kitchen. I had some good expectations because of the good reviews on here, but people's taste buds must be off because I don't understand how superb can be used to describe the food here and it is just sad if this is the best Chinese food some people have had :(",0
t7b_86s_Q__P35H9NXedhw,"These Gyros are so good they make me wanna Gyr-ate my hips and yell ""Gyro-nimo."" Although I'm not sure why I would because that would be both weird and sexual. Then again, things that are both weird and sexual are usually right up my proverbial (and literal, if I'm lucky) alley.

What to get: Mini Gyro
What else: Minime was a really crap character, to be honest, in retrospect
But: Hindsight is always 20 20

How to improve: Hard to say, really. Not too much improving to be done. Maybe slightly fresher veggies, such as at Best Gyros out in East Cleveland. Maybe try out different Gyro meats and some authentic Athens Pork style Gyros? Also, because these are so cheap, they sometimes taste slightly more cheaply made. Best Gyros proves you can have perfect tasting Gyros at basement prices. Gyro World take note! The decor here is also rather dreary. But I don't care about such things. However, for other people who do, they might spruce it up a bit at some point. Really cool arcade machines though - throwback style - for the kids. Love that.

So I went looking for some salt and pepper in a big bucket. I was just fishing for condiments.

Now on with the compliments.

The service here is really lovely. They were a little tired the night of the World Series but who wasn't. A bad night for Cleveland. The Gyro they made for me was hot and delicious and I loved every bite. Easily one of the 20 best in the country.

How can you be one of the 20 best Gyros in North America, but not even the best Gyro in Cleveland? Gyro World - that's how. Their products are delicious, and easily the most satisfying Gyro in the West Burbs of the great city known as The Land. However, the East Burbs rival (Best Gyros) is probably even better.

Both are extraordinarily cheap (especially if you get a mini Gyro), and both will solve your Gyro craving forthwith henceforth hitherto, whatever that means. The young males working here (I know you like that, bro, and it's cool with me, I do too) are super friendly, and will gladly whip it out for you... I mean, whip one up for you... if you have 5 dollars or so to donate to their proverbial piggy bank.

In Cleveland it's all Chicago-style Gyros (this is, after all, like a smaller version of Chicago), which means they're the big lamb-and-beef spindles with the knives slicing the meat off them. Probably my favourite kind - not authentic to Greece but definitely authentic to Chi-town. Ironically, Cleveland has an argument to doing Chicago Gyros better than Chicago.

Other top Gyros in the country are Oakland Gyros in Milwaukee, Nick's in Atlanta, Gyro World (not related) in Queens, Yia Yia's in DC, Greek Gourmet or Gali's in Pitt, a place I haven't reviewed yet in Davenport, Ekko's and a few others in Houston, and if I'm forgetting anyone, I apologize. Here in Cleveland, Frank's in Ohio City does it well, too.

And if this was in Europe, it'd be Euro World. Whereas if you were only allowed to visit it once in your life, it'd be YOLO World. Thankfully you can keep coming here, over and over, and at these prices, you can get seriously rotund and portly off Gyros. Try it. Thank me later. Gyr welcome.",1
TaEASKZil0TT7CAzyqFUgw,The name really explains it all. Great place to go before a sporting event or even for a night out with friends. Great authentic Mexican food and not to mention who doesn't love free chips and salsa !?!,1
TaEASKZil0TT7CAzyqFUgw,"Hey, if you like theme bars that charge you way too much for way too little this is the place for you! Everything is terrible: service, food, atmosphere, etc... I would strongly recommended if you are in Cleveland you stay away from this establishment and try something a tad bit more authentic.",0
Tal9LqH3fvSDiF_-YDnfEg,"Best Indian in Cleveland. Great place to go for authentic cuisine,  but atmosphere is ""dive"" like because it's not new or clean looking.",1
Tal9LqH3fvSDiF_-YDnfEg,"Had a chance to go for buffet while moving back from Niagara to Chicago, the taste of food is really really authentic to Indian taste and is also very good. Veg and Non-veg dishes had the smell and taste as it was cooked by person who is cooking for his family. Tandoori chicken if one of the best I have ever eaten in US. The good part of it was it was not colored but cooked to make it red. Even the Kheer was pretty good and as like cooked by Mom. Very Delightful

The price is also very genuine so you will definitely feel good after eating here.

One this which might depress you a little is the service is not so good, you might have to wait for plates or buffet stuffs to come.

I gave 4 as I declined all its sins after tasting the food. :) :) 
I even said to Owner while leaving .. "" Saat Khoon Maaf"" :P :P",1
Tal9LqH3fvSDiF_-YDnfEg,"I figured with my new-found promotion and my proximity to the magic number 100 on yelp, I ought to stop studying for my exams long enough to put up a couple new reviews for the places I've been relying upon to keep my weight up!

Now, being in the medical field, I have my fair share of friends from all over India and from Pakistan as well...and they all love to cook their spicy food for the little white girl thinking that ""she can't handle it"".  The looks of shock and despair when I wolf down their hottest family concoctions and proclaim them only mild or medium are quite amusing to my sadistic sense of humour (and shush, I'm Canadian, that's how we spell it!).

Indian cuisine is one of my favorites and I haven't had it since moving to Cleveland in July...I was in definite withdrawal and dying for it and managed to grab some take-out from Indian Delight last night to share with a friend.

Phone order went a little something like this...

Me: Could I get a Chicken Madras and Rogan Josh along with a Neelgiri Korma?
Owner: Sure, how spicy would you like them?
Me: Indian spicy for the first two and medium for the Korma (traditionally Kormas are mild or medium and for my dining partner's sensitivity b/c I neglected to ask them if uber-spicy stuff was ok, lol)
Owner: ....*Pause*.....
Me:  Hello?
Owner:  You say ""Indian spicy""??
Me: yes, the hottest you can make it....
Owner:  ok....uh, any lassi to go with that?

So, after I got in the order and brought it home we got to tuck in to some really excellent food.  Their Papri Chat is top notch....for the love of god people, don't order samosas every time you go to an Indian restaurant...try some of the more authentic stuff to start off with!

Requisite garlic naan and basmati rice to go along with the main dishes.  Madras and Rogan Josh were both excellent but I found the Korma a little lacking, seemed like it might have been a local variant that wasn't exactly my favorite.  Indian spicy?  Glad I ordered it that way because it was only about a medium in my books, but definitely excellent enough to be back for more!

Can't really comment on the restaurant since I just got take-out, but the owner met me at the door and was really nice and my food was just ready when I got there (they were pulling the naan out of the oven as I was walking in the door).  Another customer was there also waiting to pick up his order and said that the Biryani was the best thing on the menu (noted for the next occasion, although I make a pretty good biryani of my own!).

So, all in all, an amazing experience and due to it's close proximity to my apartment, I will be coming back for take-out quite a bit!",1
Tal9LqH3fvSDiF_-YDnfEg,"Every time I have had food at Indian delight, it has been totally great. The Father and Son duo make you feel special and the food is hot and steaming. They willingly alter the spice levels. This will always be my top place to go in Cleveland for their authentic goat biriyani, kebabs and naan. I would recommend trying their Nihari and Halim.....mouth watering!!!",1
Tal9LqH3fvSDiF_-YDnfEg,"Indian Delight is the newest entry in growing collection of Detroit Shoreway neighborhood. They are open 7 days a week, and I think they may have a lunchtime buffet (at least the buffet stand was set up with christmas tinsel no less). It has authentic plastic table cloths and the decoration is pretty spartan. We tried the vegetarian samosas which were pretty good. I had Chicken Makhani which was delicious and my friend had Chicken Saagwala. We were both wimps and ordered our food medium which turned out to be more like mild. The basmati rice was really good and plentiful and the naan was excellent. It's a great addition to the hood, and I see a lot of Indian carryout in my future",1
Tal9LqH3fvSDiF_-YDnfEg,"This is my favorite Indian restaurant in Cleveland. Go there again and again and it's always good! Hole in the wall place so don't expect much in terms of ambience or service. The food is outstanding, tastes authentic and made fresh. Not overgreasy or overspiced. Just right. And prices are affordable. I cook a lot at home and give cooking lessons in Indian food so have high standards.",1
Tal9LqH3fvSDiF_-YDnfEg,"Try the chicken 65, samosas, n biryani. Yum! Best authentic Indian food place I've had in Cleveland so far. Don't let the look of the place fool you. Diamond in the rough.",1
Tal9LqH3fvSDiF_-YDnfEg,"This is the best Indian food I've had outside of my brother in law's (from northern india) cooking. I'm so glad to have just discovered it was so close! Very authentic flavors, fluffy naan, and a wonderful kick. It might not be much to look at, but if you care mostly about the food and not the peripherals, this place is legit. 

If you care more about ambience, take it to go! The prices lend themselves well to take out.",1
Tal9LqH3fvSDiF_-YDnfEg,"Amazing authentic Indian food.  Surprisingly something that has been hard to find in Cleveland. Would highly recommended their chaat. For meat lovers try to get their haleem...best haleem I have had. For those of you who have nwver heard of it before, its a dish usually exclusively made by muslims in the asian subcontinent during the time of ramadan. They usually have it while breaking their fast. It is slowly cooked over a few hours with wheat, meat and spices. And their biryani ? Definitely authentic hyderbadi biryani.",1
Tal9LqH3fvSDiF_-YDnfEg,"Been here twice and loved it both times . I am a vegetarian and had the buffet the first time . The food was super tasty and the gulab jamun tasted as if made of Khoa . The only drawback was that there were no paneer dishes in the buffet . 

I went there again today and ordered the paneer pakora , malai kofta , garlic naan and onion kulcha and everything was flavourful. I asked our server to make malai kofta spicy and it was on point . The naan and kulcha were crunchy as the same time so light , the best I have had in a while . Our server was very helpful and I ended up thanking the cook for the food .

This is by far one of the more authentic Indian restaurants in Cleveland.",1
Tal9LqH3fvSDiF_-YDnfEg,Great food ..... I go every time I go to the Westside. The service is really nice and the for is so authentic..definitely made from scratch!!! If you want a good meal and to be full go there!!,1
Tal9LqH3fvSDiF_-YDnfEg,"By far the best Indian food I've had in Cleveland. This is the real deal. They don't skimp on the spice, and have a ton of great Indian dishes. They don't serve beer or wine but I get the impression they do most of their business through pickups. If you like real authentic Indian food, look no further.",1
TAwgNWX-Xv7xnTHeRqPReQ,I love this place. So worth the wait for some authentic Cleveland.  I had the Pierogi melt which is a pierogi with sauerkraut and Muenster cheese on rosemary bread. Mmmm. Delicious. Also try the Hungarian hash.  Such a little treasure. The Bloody Mary is the best I have ever had!,1
tCVma1LcSnLWBRqJoTom5g,"Not sure why I haven't noted this before, but they take all their orders by hand (sans computer) so don't expect to order quickly. Prices are slightly higher than their competition, but not by too much.

That said, the staff is always very nice and helpful. 

I can confirm that their Chicago deep dish pizza is excellent and authentic. Break out your forks for this one. Wings are pretty good but the spicy bbq sauce is anything but that. Maybe they gave us the wrong sauce? Not that big of a deal. Their regular crust pizza is fairly good as well.

As always, if you are paying by card you have to tell them when you place the order. Yes, they ask if you want to tip the driver ahead of time.",0
th_1PEhLxrwzFJrBb9NyUQ,"If you're on Taylor and you walk into a sandwich shop in this street-side strip, this is what you might expect.  No frills here, and what you see is what you get.  Just authentic diner food, made in front of you for a reasonable price with no fuss.  Nobody's in a hurry and here and its cash only, thank you.  Perfect!

Their corned beef sandwich is far better and cheaper than ANY other place at Cedar/Taylor.  Sorry, Mr Brisket (not).  Their smooth grits also are way, way above average and not dry or crusty at all.

Such better quality and price than Melt or Mr Brisket.  Walk over and see for yourself.

A simple short menu with breakfast and lunch done right.",1
tIby_wfzpZ5QH02IWFNogg,"I discovered this restaurant via a random yelp search for Chinese food, and wow - I'm very glad I tried it!  I think this unassuming little place at CSU might have just become my newest go-to spot in the city for authentic Chinese and Taiwanese food, particularly beef noodle soup and bubble tea!

So first of all, the bubble tea. Those from the coasts might be familiar with a couple of very large bubble tea chains.  This restaurant is the first place in Cleveland to partner with one of these chains.  This means that they are following a recipe specified by the chain store - thus, it is a bit formulaic, but also tried-and-true.  We tried both warm and cold bubble tea here.  The consistency of the boba was perfect, and the warm tea was made very well.  The cold bubble tea was on the sweet side but still better than anything else I've had in Cleveland.

As for food, we had Taiwanese minced meat over rice (rou zao fan), Taiwanese beef noodle soup (niu rou mian), and salt and pepper fish fillets (jiao yan yu pian).  The minced meat dish was not perfectly authentic - the consistency of the meat was a little different - but it still tasted pretty good.  The beef and the broth in the noodle soup were flavorful and authentic and I loved it!  Though I do admit they used a different noodle from what I am used to.  The fish fillets were also spot on - fried well with just the right amount of spice. 

The atmosphere is crisp and open and feels sort of like a coffee shop, designed as a place for students to hang out.  As someone else mentioned they also have games - that is - playing cards, Uno, Chinese Chess, Go, and a couple of Chinese games that I have never heard of.  The owner is very friendly and chatted with us a bit, and the prices are pretty fair.

I'll definitely be back here for more bubble tea and to try a couple more dishes.  Might even come back next week.",1
tIby_wfzpZ5QH02IWFNogg,"Try the food on their menu, that are some authentic Chinese/Taiwanese food. Good services, good food. Would definitely visit if stop by downtown Cleveland again.",1
tIby_wfzpZ5QH02IWFNogg,"I have never written a review before, but my experience today was extremely disappointing. I've been here at least eight times, and this will probably be my last time here. I'm so so disappointed by the food and milk tea today. My first warning should have been none of the old staff here since they moved to their other branch Phusion Cafe (which is fantastic by the way).

Milk tea
- Large pearl black tea. I asked for light ice and sugar. It came out tasting only of milk and no tea flavor. Extremely disappointed because I love milk tea and Ten Ren milk tea is one of my favorite milk tea stores. Boba was still good. I didn't feel like asking them to remake it. 
- My two friends got Jasmine Milk green tea with pearls with light ice and sugar. Slightly better tea flavor, but mostly milk flavor. Still good boba.

Food
- Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup. I ALWAYS get it when I come here. Why? Because it is my comfort food that reminds me of home since my mom makes fantastic beef noodle soup. This time, the soup (which is typically dark brown and flavorful) was bland and watered down to a light brown. The beef was still marinated well.
- Minced Meat Rice. My friend always get this and both her and I were disappointed. The sauce is supposed to be slightly thick, but this time it was so watery. It was pretty much had no taste  with a weird sour aftertaste. Honestly, it seems like it may have just been premade and then reheated, but maybe kept in the fridge too long.
- Kung pao Chicken. My Caucasian friend got this and even she couldn't finish half of her meal. The chicken was bone dry and had no flavor. The peanuts were not cooked well and tasted and crunched like just normal salted peanuts. The celery was literally mush in your mouth. The fried rice was extremely yellow and tasted so bad that I spat it out.

Service
- We were ordering to eat at the restaurant, but had to pay first and order at the front desk. In the other times that I have been there, this was never the case. We were always seated, given menus, and paid at the end. I'm not sure if this is a new store policy or something.
- The food also came out in takeout containers and takeout chopsticks despite the fact that we ate in the restaurant. I saw the Indian cashier take my take out container and pour it into a bowl before serving me. My friends still had take out containers though. It wasn't even close to closing hours too.
- It honestly just felt like we had ordered takeout and ate at the restaurant instead.

I'm so so disappointed about my food and drink that it is almost hilarious. After this, I will be going to Phusion Cafe since most of their workers will be there and I won't risk the chance of having one of my favorite foods and drinks being bad.

EDIT
After emailing Phusion Cafe, I was notified fairly quickly that there is no relation between China Sea and Phusion Cafe. They are separate restaurants and I will still be going to Phusion Cafe as China Sea has gone downhill.",0
tIby_wfzpZ5QH02IWFNogg,"I love this place!  I used to eat here all the time when it was in the old location in the Buckley building.  It was the go-to place when the weather was nasty.  They strike a good balance between ""fast food"" Chinese and traditional Chinese, offering speed and convenience without sacrificing too much authenticity.  The food is always of good quality with a nice, if somewhat predictable, selection on the buffet.  The buffet is priced by the pound so you don't feel like you have to pack your takeout box to the brim just to get your money's worth.  With a little practice, a normal person can take just the right amount of food to eat a full lunch for around $4-6 (via buffet by the pound).  The trick is in learning what's just enough without taking too much.  I especially like the peanut butter chicken, the egg foo young, the fried green beans, and the mushroom-pepper-chicken.  The owner is great, very friendly, usually laughing and making jokes.  I missed seeing him and the giant buffet when the old store closed, I'm really happy that the new store is still within walking distance of where I work.",1
tIby_wfzpZ5QH02IWFNogg,"Honestly I didn't expect to get authentic Chinese food in Cleveland, however the food actually tastes pretty good! Service was great too",1
tIby_wfzpZ5QH02IWFNogg,Great newly open Chinese restaurant! Very impressed with the authentic Chinese food from this local place.,1
tIby_wfzpZ5QH02IWFNogg,"Apparently, the owner takes off on Sundays (but the restaurant is still open).  This means that on Sundays, they don't offer anything from their authentic Taiwanese menu, and the restaurant transforms into an wholly Americanized Chinese place.  So if you are looking for authentic Chinese food, don't come on Sundays.

We've also come back a couple of times and tried a few different things.  They offer pretty delicious jade tofu dishes (with the soft, yummy tofu!) and pretty good three cup chicken.   The beef ho fun (beef with thick flat noodles) is on par with other Chinese restaurants in the area. The seafood hot pot wasn't as good.

Also, the bubble tea tastes different each time depending on who is making it on a given day.  It's still pretty good overall compared to Cleveland standards, but it varies from so-so to very good.  They also seem to run out of bubbles for their bubble tea quite frequently, especially if you are coming at dinnertime.

Everything else from my previous review still applies.  I still like the beef noodle soup despite the different noodle.",0
tIby_wfzpZ5QH02IWFNogg,"Big fan of the restaurant. Very authentic Chinese food! 
Strongly recommend: SautÁE©ed deep fried Jade Toku & Fish! Hot & Spicy beef! SautÁE©ed pork and squid with turnip!  And also the bubbbbbble tea! !Just amazing!!!
The tea there is also great! 

Another big pro: really large volume! Big plates! But fair prices! I went there several times. Every time I left with boxes :D

Forgot to say,it has board role-playing games! Nice place to hang out!",1
tjUBOqJK-iH8S40pYGhF3Q,"Let me start by saying, I'm already hooked - the St Paul Sammy is incredible!  One of the best things I've ever eaten.  This place is so good that I've already ordered twice and they've only been open a little more than a week. Taiwanese beef noodle soup and Taiwanese old fashion meat sauce are not only very authentic but DELICIOUS!  Lo Mein and Black Pepper Beef were also solid.  Can't wait to try everything on the menu.  We needed a fresh high quality Chinese take away in the area.  Oh and btw, the prices are great!  See you guys again soon....",1

It is a a great experience !",1

TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"The best taco I've found in all of northeast Ohio. So fresh, juicy and full of flavor . I am obsessed with the corn tortillas they are so unbelievably fresh. A charming place with so much character and great authentic Mexican food and market items.",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"This place is the real deal. I can't say I am an expert on what qualifies as ""authentic"" Mexican food being an American-born male raised on Taco Bell, but this place sure feels like it. It's a Mexican grocery store first with a small kitchen and seating area in the back corner. As you walk towards the ordering counter, you pass a bakery section with smells of fresh churros and cakes filling the area. The ladies behind the counter speak broken english which only adds to an atmosphere of anticipation as it relates to the quality of the food.

I ordered the carnitas, asada and barbacoa tacos. They cook the meat on a grill top right next to the counter and the creation is fast and simple. Tortilla, fresh meat and boom you are on your way towards the toppings station. They have a trio of salsas, onions, radishes, limes and a guacamole sauce that you can use to unlimitedly dress your tacos. I dressed mine up real nice although the meat was flavorful enough not to require much if one so chooses. Best $7.50 you will ever spend on a meal.

I will definitely be back again. Especially excited to try the torta, which looks incredible based on the pics.",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"I tried La Plaza for the first time a few weeks ago and loved it. They have authentic tacos-- real corn flour tortilla and real meat with seasoning. There isn't cheese, sour cream, or lettuce. These are not Americanized Mexican tacos-- these are real. They do have a little ""salsa"" bar with onions, cilantro, avocado, and some little home made salsa. The food is full of flavor!",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"Huaaapa! This place will go lucha libre in your mouth.  Lets just start off with the taco stand.  These are about as good as it gets. The meats are great quality, well seasoned, sauces are a mouth-gasm, and the tortillas are good!  The tacos are worth the trip alone!

Next do not wait but run to meat/deli counter!  All of the meats are excellent. Any of the the ones marinated in the adobo are to die for! (they are red)  The pork, beef, chicken,chorizo- amazing, great quality and very affordable!

Next the cooked meats, barbacoa, lechon, chorizo con papas(potato)  prepared the way it should be made! Just reheat in your house put on totilllas sauce it up and Om Nom  Nom. This place will be putting Mexican Grandmothers out of business!

In the deli section the also offer some dinner platters with rice and beans for just a minimal cost, less than fast food!

The homeade salsa will have you singing Labamba, the guac,green and red salsa, pico, and the spicy are executed flawlessly!  The home made chips are some of the best I have ever tasted!  BTW I DO NOT WORK FOR THESE PEOPLE AND OR RECEIVE DISCOUNTS!

There is also a huge assortment of fresh authentic Mexican breads and pastries. The produce look quite good as well.  So if you want lunch, dinner, or throw a party this is a great way to do it.

Oh one more thing everyone that served me spoke English and they excelled at customer service. It was different, I felt like the employees were grateful for helping me!",1

Check out this gem of a taco place, you won't be disappointed with these authentic mexican tacos ^_^",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"This review is for the tacos and bakery in the back. I didn't really go through the rest of the store to evaluate then as a grocery.

$2 tacos that you pay for in the front and bring the receipt to in the back for them to make your food. The tacos themselves seemed pretty authentic and were tasty. By themselves though, I'm not sure they were unique enough for me to go out of my way to get them here. What stood out to me though is the condiments bar nearby. You can put as much cilantro, lime, hot sauce, grilled onions, fresh onions, and/or grilled jalapeÁE±o as you want!

The bakery was pretty typical, didn't seem super special. There are no labels on the goods, so my gf and I were at a lost of what we were buying and did so blindly.",0
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"Its awesome having an authentic Mexican grocery store two miles away.

       I've been here a billion times, and I've never had a bad experience. The taco truck carries some of the best summer food (especially the chorizo or al pastor tacos with lime and a tangerine soda=so much yum). Sometimes, I'm feeling lazy and don't want to make dinner-BAM pico do gallo and chips, ready to go. The guacamole is great too, but you have to get there early because it sells out. The desserts always look great, but I'm still working up the guts to try em. And I can always appreciate being able to spend about $20 and eat for a week. I'll pick La Plaza over GE any day!",1

TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"The tacos al pastor are so amazing, just add some onions and cilantro, a squirt of lime and a salsa of your choice and you have yourself the best taco in Cleveland. I want to try the other meats but I just can't separate myself from the al pastor. 

In addition to the great tacos, the store offers nearly everything you need for authentic Mexican cooking. They also have Peruvian ingredients that you can't find in many places. The meat section is full of so many different cuts of meat, but I have not bought any (yet). 

La Plaza is one of the best places in Cleveland for both shopping and eating, if I lived closer I would be there at least once a week!",1

3. Awesome baked goods (bread is $0.75). 
4. Full butcher.  Meat-alicious.  
5. Mystery junk food and candy that is irresistible (disclaimer: only mysterious if you don't speak espanol, like me). 
6. Bonus jewelry counter. 

I've been annoyed for years that Columbus has a plenitude of authentic taco trucks and Clevelanders are forced to survive without. Perennially disappointing sports franchises AND no taco trucks? How much more can we take, I ask! How much more?? 

I have a pretty hard crush on the tacos at La Plaza Supermarket. I'm partial to the chorizo tacos and al pastor. Load those bad boys up with cilantro, onions and fresh squeezed lime and decide to learn Spanish because they're so delicious and you never want anything to come between you and your tacos again. The tacos come in doubled up warm, soft, dreamy grilled corn tortillas. $2/taco.  The tacos are so simple, but so full of flavor. 

You can get the tacos and/or other prepared hot foods back at the deli area (or on the taco cart, if applicable). Pay at the register first and then go back and put in your order. then wander around wanting to buy stuff because it looks interesting even though you know better. 

There's also lots of great items in the store to buy/try for adventurous (or even mildly daring) home cooks. 

Near the highway. Easy to get in/out. Decent sized parking lot. 

Highly recommended.",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,If you're looking for anything Mexican this is the place! The only problem I have is the eating area can get a little dirty. Other than that the tacos are amazing there's plenty items to grab on your way out as well. Definitely need to check them out if you're looking for authentic Mexican street style tacos.,1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"Love this place, the supermarket has fresh made guacamole and salsas and a good selection of marinated meats. My favorite reason to go here is the grill on the back where they make fresh authentic tacos. My favorites are the Carne Asada, Chorizo, and carnitas. They also have a cooler to the right where you can get fresh cilantro, onions and homemade salsas. Tacos are $2.50 a piece and very filling. I end up getting 4 because they are so good but really 2 or 3 should be plenty for a meal.",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"If you are a foodie who loves exploring and going on local adventures, visiting La Plaza Supermarket is absolutely a must. The selection is much more extensive and the prices are cheaper than any other local Latino food store in the area. You can find pretty much anything from fresh meats, cheeses and produce to dozens of sauces and imported foods. You also can't leave without trying foods from the taco stand in the back of the store. It's the most authentic Mexican food I've ever eaten and relatively inexpensive. The one caution I have is to bring cash when you go. You can use cards at the register but not at the food stand. In just a review, I can't tell you how much I love this place! It's like traveling to another country for an hour!",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"I can't believe I haven't tried this place sooner. I've been searching for authentic tacos, chasing food trucks around the city that inevitably disappoint, when I should've relied on yelp to steer me in the right direction. Damn good tacos. LEGIT, AUTHENTIC tacos. A good price at $2 a piece as well. 

You prepay for your tacos at the front registers and take your ticket to the back and make your order. Carne asada, chorizo, and al pastor, OH MY. Cravings satisfied. Carne asada was my favorite, but I can't wait to try more. 

I used to have to wait till my next trip out of town to find some good tacos, but no more. La Plaza is the real deal.",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"This is an authentic mexican grocery store with a deli and a taco cart. 

Bring Cash- 
They have carnitas, asada, tripa, barbacoa, lengua, chorizo and menudo, pozole, tortas and quesadillas. 
You can pay with card at the register just get your order slip and take it in and then give it back to the lady in the register. 
You have to add your own condiment bar 

Guacamole is not spicy
red sause SPICY
green mild 
Cilantro and Onion as garnishes. 
Also grilled jalapenos and onions

They do have some things at the deli other then what is listed above 
is pretty good as in amazing* 

This is not vegan or vegetarian friendly ** 
Corn tortillas dont have glutten but flour tortillas do. 

The Staff does speak english but please don't be rude to them if they ask you to repeat your self to get the correct order. 

They have sweet breads (Pan Dulce) and a huge butcher shop- 
if you need mexican groceries this is the place to go to.  

They have a small siting area in the back and outside but it gets busy. 


This is authentic tacos.",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"I'll be honest, I read a superb review of la plaza and couldn't stop thinking about it. I couldn't get the image of authentic tacos out of my head, so by the weekend, I had to go there. 
Maybe one of the best decisions of my life- okay that's an exaggeration- but these tacos are everything I wanted and so much more. I've been to Mexico many times and have had amazing food- and these were on par. 
I was not expecting la plaza to be such an expansive grocery. They have aisles upon aisles of authentic Mexican fare. Stuff you would probably have a hard time finding elsewhere. I'd love to say I looked around more, but I was on a one track taco mission, glancing briefly at the snacks and cans and fresh produce, heading straight to the back of the store. 
There is the holy grail, a small lunch counter where they're grilling up meats of all kinds for some authentic taco lovin. I'm going to be honest, we went a little crazy. Tacos el pastor, chorizo, carnitas, wrapped in double fresh tortillas, we ordered them all. They come ""naked"" so you're able to dress them up with the topping you'd like at the little cart right next to the counter. I'm a traditionalist so I dressed mine with onions, cilantro, and a squeeze of lime, but they also had some salsas you could use as well. 
If you couldn't already tell by the enthusiasm, they were delicious. Every single one was awesome. The chorizo was my favorite, but I would happily order any of them again. Do yourself a favor and wash them down with a Mexican coke. 
What came next I can only describe as post taco euphoria. We decided to take this flavor party home with us and bought everything. Homemade chips, corn tortillas, tamales, house made guacamole and fresh salad. We stopped by the butcher counter and got marinated meat to cook at home. We got thres leche out of the bakery fridge. Oh and why not some Mexican beer. 
I think we ate Mexican for the next four days. But I do not regret one single minute of it. Everything we bought was of great quality and equally great taste. 
I consider myself lucky for finding this spot. Just writing this review has me craving some chorizo tacos.",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"La Plaza is taco heaven. During the summer they have the taco stand outside on certain days, but you can generally find it inside of the supermarket towards the back by the deli area. They serve authentic Mexican tacos and have a variety of meat selections for you to choose from. Some people miss it, but they also have a small area for you to add toppings right by the side of cashier. Definitely the place to go for some quick, delicious tacos.",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"After living in Southern California for a few years, I came back to Cleveland and could not find an authentic Mexican spot for tacos. La Plaza Supermarket is that place and I am so happy to have finally found it. I will be a regular here from now on. Amazing tacos and great customer service.",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"Years ago we'd come for the taco bar in back, $1 tacos were awesome! And the sauces they provide are the greatest. We started shopping a buying our own ingredients and making them at home. Best place we've found on the west-side that has everything under one roof for an authentic Mexican meal. Love going here. The employees are helpful and always seem to be smiling.",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"OMG!  I haven't had authentic barbacoa taco's like these since I was a kid growing up in Houston, TX, south side.  It brought back memories when I remember on Sunday mornings my dad would get a basket of barbacoa and corn tortillas from the local Mercado.  So tender and flavorful.  These are authentic Mexican street tacos. If you're in the area, you should stop and have two, or three, or four.  I think I stopped at four?",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"Did you know that La Plaza is Spanish for ""The Plaza""?  Now you do!  I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food, but every now and then I like a good taco.  This place opened up a while ago, after two previous grocery stores tried and failed to be successful there.  This place, I have a feeling, may stick around.  

It's not a great location for a supermarket, being hidden away in an odd commercial district of Lakewood Heights Blvd., and the parking lot is tiny, but then I've never seen it crowded either.  

I needed some groceries and this place is right by where I lived, so I went there for the first time recently.  I'm no expert, but their selection of Mexican and south american grocery items seems pretty comprehensive.  There's more stuff there than I know what it is.  

The staff are all friendly, all speak Spanish, and everyone I dealt with was conversant in English as well, and there is nothing about the place that seems fake or inauthentic, if you care about that sort of thing.

I happened to be shopping on a weekend day, and there was a small stand outside that was selling food. On my way out I bought a taco, just to try it, and I'm immediately hooked.  OMG this is THE best taco I've had since the former cook at El Tango Taqueria on Madison quit several years ago.  This one isn't quite as great, by comparison, but it is definitely right there in my top two, and my #1 can't be obtained any longer, so this is the current reigning champ when it comes to tacos.  And I can walk there in minutes.  Fuck yeah.

I don't want this place to ever go out of business now, so every weekend I'm going to go there and order as many tacos as I can stuff in me.",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"It's really good food and very authentic tacos and food there... The only problem is it you don't speak Spanish (I don't) it's slightly challenging to communicate...but if that's the worst of your problems for the day, I'd say your having a pretty good day.",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"So I find myself frequently coming here because of the quesadillas and tacos. I haven't tried anything else because I don't know what most of the other Spanish food is but I know that it looks appetizing. If you want authentic, fresh food with more than reasonable prices, come to this unassuming supermarket. There's almost always a line when I come because good patrons know good food.",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"Thanks PW! I never knew this place existed until my addiction for authentic Mexican tacos was causing me to grief and lash out like a true crack addict. 

The tacos alone are worth a trip every week. I been coming back once a week for a quick order of the tacos. Literally... crack. It's f-ing good. A few other items I love to get here is the homemade tamales and super cheap, super good salsa and guacamole. Takes me back home where the authentic Mexican cuisine doesn't have to come from a fancy restaurant, but from the back of a food truck or marketplace.",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"I am perpetually on a hunt for all things Mexican, unfortunately our quest does not stop here. It's a decent enough store but it was low on variety and product. The search goes on.

My Mexican sister-in-law and I drove to Cleveland to stock up on Mexican spices, pan dulce (sweet bread), and other Mexican treats. Walking in the store, it smells like Mexico, it made us feel right at home. It was so nice to see brown people, as my nephews call other Mexicans. We live in Canton, which is low on brown. :)

We arrived around 1 p.m. on Thursday and the deli counters were very empty. The seafood was completely empty. The red meat counter only had a few items in it and the chicken area had the most variety. It was nice to see familiar cuts - like adobo and flattened chicken breasts.

Everything else was just ok. I wanted to get some sangria and could only find one brand, which isn't even the most popular. I want Sangria Senorial, which most places also carry in diet. 

We also wanted specific Mexican candy that is also very popular (Pelon) and authentic Mexican vanilla. They had neither. We did get cajeta, which makes us happy.

I don't know what people are talking about with a taco stand. The restaurant is now separate from the store, maybe its only on weekends or every other tuesday when its sunny and warm, no idea. They had deli food in the back but it was just your basic chicken and potato taquitos. They do however have the jewelry store so pick up some beans and an engagement ring.

So overall this store isn't bad, just isn't great. It doesn't carry much more than the super Walmart near my house in Mexican products. No need to drive all the way up there again to go.",0
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"First time trying their tacos. Chorizo and Barbacoa on two fresh mini tortilla. Different salsa's available with fresh cilantro, onions, and limes. One of the best authentic Mexican taco's I've had in a long time. Each variety is an excellent blend of spices and ingredients. This ain't your typical Taco Bell taco. This is the real deal. One place you have to try if you are in Cleveland. Then they have a wide selection of hot sauce in their grocery store or anything else you would need for your mexican food needs.",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,Great hole in the wall! It's a supermarket but it has a grill in the back where they make made to order tapas (little tacos!) there's different kinds or you can get a vegetarian quesadilla! They're fresh and they have a bakery with a variety of baked goods for dessert! Very authentic place with a salsa bar and cilantro (my personal favorite),1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"Hands down La Plaza is the most authentic Mexican establishment in Cleveland. Delicious prepared foods as well as a huge selection of Mexican and Latin American grocery options. La Plaza now has an outdoor patio for the summer to enjoy their tacos and fajitas at lunch time! Best guac around and salsa that are fresh, flavorful, and authentic as compared to many of the attempts in the Cleveland area. Bonus if you or someone you are with speaks Spanish. Cannot recommend this place more highly for this area if you are looking for authentic Mexican cuisine or ingredients.",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"Love this gem of a store/restaurant!  The tacos are to die for, and the bakery items not to be missed for dessert.  Run, don't walk, for an authentic meal.  Then grocery shop for great Mexican specialties.",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"This store has hands down the best tacos in Cleveland. The grocery store is a little different, I haven't actually shopped for anything besides the tacos but that is all you really need. $2.50 for a taco that tastes amazing. If you need authentic food you need to go here!",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"This place is super authentic - don't believe me, because I'm as European as they get - believe my Mexican husband from Palm Springs. According to him, this is exactly what Mexican supermarkets are like in Southern California. It makes him feel more at home since I made him move from the desert to Cleveland, where it's sunny, you know, 7 days a year. 

Back to La Plaza: there's even a jewelry store in there! If you are looking for some sort of Mexican brand or ingredient, you will find it here. The prices for spices, etc is much more reasonable than if you were to buy it elsewhere. Their chorizo is incredible - flavorful and not as greasy as you find in normal supermarkets. On the weekends they have a taco cart in the store.",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"La Plaza might just have the best authentic Mexican tacos. I didn't even realize that this supermarket had a great lunch spot back in the corner of the store until someone told me how good their tacos were, so I had to check it out for myself. My fiance and I had lunch here on a Saturday afternoon right around 12:00pm. It wasn't crowded when we got in line, but as soon as we sat down the line of people waiting to order was getting long. I had three tacos one each of barbacoa, carnitas and chorizo. He had a steak taco and a carnitas burrito. The food was delicious. It was made right in front of us and done quickly. The best part was the salsa and taco toppings bar that included 4 or 5 different spicy salsas and sauces, onions, limes, radishes and cilantro. 

Tacos were $2.50, burritos $7, and they also had tortas and quesadillas which were also cheap. 

They only have a couple of tables so I would suggest getting there early for lunch. I forgot to ask how late they stay open, but I have a feeling they are only serving for lunch.",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"Wow. So far the only place in Cleveland that I could find authentic Tijuana style tacos!!! Although not perfect, I still want to give five stars for the rarity of this. As someone from San Diego, I really miss the supermarkets like Northgate and the taquerias everywhere. 

Double layered corn tortillas. Great, although they did come out of a bag and were not fresh made in house. Although my favorite kind of taco is adobada, I truly felt that the strong suit of La Plaza supermarket tacos was their pollo and barbacoa. Soooo good. The adobada and the asada was still good though. No radish in the toppings bar, or pickled vegetables. I did not try the chorizo taco. 

I'm so upset that they don't have horchata available except on weekends!! I was really looking forward to horchata but I will have to come back on a weekend. 

I was hoping that the taqueria would have elotes, but they have corn cups. I would not recommend these. However, for $1.50 you do get quite a large serving. The corn is definitely canned, and it was very heavily buttered. They did top it with queso fresco though. If anyone knows where I can find elotes in Cleveland lmk!

Overall, I highly recommend the tacos here. It cost me $10 for 4 tacos. Not bad. And they were very tasty and fresh.",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"The taco options are carnitas, steak, chorizo and something else. They have grilled peppers for an additional charge. The tacos are authentic and simple. They have side dishes of fresh cilantro, limes and onion to garnish your tacos when they come off the grill. They are only $2 per taco. They are only available on the weekend. I encourage taco lovers to come here! You won't have the hipster vibe of Barrio which is a plus!

The grocery store is pretty nice as well. They cater to Mexican cuisine and have things you will not find at a normal store (cactus and odd beef cuts). They have fresh made salsa and guacamole in the $2-$6 price range. They have the standard mild along with salsa verde. They have one of my favorite hot sauces as well for $2 and some change: El Yucateco Mayan XXXtra Hot.",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,Food counter in the back is Insane authentic Mexican. Had a Chorizo burrito and an asada taco. Really amazing. Sorry Chipotle.,1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"Wow what a hidden gem,Had a very good quick lunch with taco's and topping bar and everything was awesome and then picked up some authentic items in the grocery store be sure to get some tamales to reheat at home",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"The Verdict: Just come here. You want tacos? You were planning to go where?! nono, turn around and just come here.

The Food: I bought the al pastor which is marinated bbq pork. So. Good. Usually I would write a lot but I'm speechless. A friend bought the burrito and it's the size of a newborn baby and thought it tasted amazing. I meant the burrito, not the baby. 

The Extras: The supermarket is a front to the chest full of golden tacos in the back. They sell a lot of authentic Mexican grocery brands and even Mexican baked goods/pastries. As for the tacos, I believe on the warm days they'll sell them in front of the store next to the picnic tables. If not, they're at the back of the store. I suggest also buying Jarrito soda to get the full experience.",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"Perhaps others have mentioned the tacos?? It's pretty simple: delicious, authentic tacos here. Carnitas and chorizo are my favorite but they have several others including tripe and tongue as specials on weekends. Quesadilla for the 2 year old with that delicious gooey white cheese - a big hit. So cheap - 20 bucks-ish for 6 tacos, the aforementioned quesadilla, two drinks and 3 pastries! Insanity! They expanded the seating area and re-did the toppings station so it flows much better now. You can pick up some drinks and pastries on your way back to the taco counter but remember - it's cash only back there. 

The rest of the store is great too. Fresh produce always looks great and most of it is reasonably priced. Homemade salsas, guacamole, pickled veggies - all delicious! Only dig is that I wish they had more South American items (they have some Peruvian, but not much else), but it is mostly a Mexican grocery so can't fault them too much. 

We love this place so much and are so lucky it's in our backyard! Get in there for the tacos and you'll be hooked I promise you.",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"Everyone is polite. The food is hot. And most importantly, authentic. No where else in the city can compete. One of our favorites.",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,Really authentic tacos and very nice people. I see myself coming back many many times. I tried them all and they were all delicious. The price is perfect. There was no sitting area but it is your typical mexican street food. This is my first time and I was in a rush but I will see the actual grocery store next time I go.,1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"The most authentic Mexican restaurant in CLE. Tacos are $2.50. I've had all meat choices and they're all fantastic : asada, Pollo, chorizo, shredded steak. The self serve topping bar has various salsas, guac, pico de Gallo, onions, limes, cilantro. The taqueria is at the back of the grocery store. It's cash only. The taqueria closes about an hour earlier than the grocery store. Side note the guac sold in the grocery store is amazing, pricy but amazing.",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"I hate to jump on the hype train for places, but with the recent kitchen remodel at La Plaza made for a good excuse to try. 

I have had La Plaza many times from when they used to grill on the patio, to the made to order counter in the back. This recent trip was just as satisfying. It may not have been the most authentic Mexican I have had but everything (guacamole, torta, tamale, taco) met or exceeded expectations. Nothing was too ""Americanized"", there is a free salsa bar including peppers and onions, and it definitely now has the restaurant feel. 

This place does get busy at lunch time so be prepared! Prices are a little high but not outrageous (well, maybe finding guacamole was $11) and the soda fountain was down (but c'mon everybody knows you have to get a glass bottle coke or jarritos) but really this was a great improvement to an already great lunch spot.",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"I grew up in LA and moved here a year ago. Let me tell you, this place is LEGIT. I had so much trouble trying to find a place to get good authentic Mexican food. This place is it! They even have elotes. I'm in love with this place. Please go if you have the chance because it's fantastic.",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"Best authentic place I've found in Ohio, carne asada tacos with onion cilantro lime and salsa verde with a  pineapple jarritos you can't go wrong amigos",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"Droppin' some stars, unfortunately. I always recommend La Plaza because their food is delicious and authentic, and as you can see from my check ins, I enjoy coming here! The past couple of times (including today's visit) the store was in shambles (dirty dining areas, trash receptacles, etc) and the taco area was equally messy, missing salsas and running low on most of the topping choices. Also unavailable was the horchata, which was a bummer because I had been totally craving it all day. Both my mom and I agreed that we didn't leave here as content and happy as previous visits. I'm sure I'll be back, but La Plaza needs to really work on professionalism, consistency, and efficiency when it comes to ordering, cleaning, and keeping products stocked.",0
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,Raised In California and coming here was my first time having authentic tacos since I left,1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,Went there randomly to get some fresh tacos. It is probably the only place I would get tacos in Cleveland which is close to authentic Mexican tacos. It's a must try if you truly enjoy tacos.,1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"I must've come on a bad night...Friday at 5:30...all these reviews talk about all these different toppings you can put on your tacos and how authentic they are. My barbacoa taco had absolutely no seasoning and eat too much fat. Chicken quesadilla was okay. The piping selection they had to choose from was brown lines, chopped cilantro, sauces that looked like someone used one ladle for all four so they were mixed together, and I had to scrap the bottom of a pick bucket to get any tomato and onion. Place is already dirty enough, but then the tables were super gross too. I wanted to take it home to eat but my husband simply could not wait. Not sure how/why people were raving about this place...maybe I need to come in the summer when they have this supposed taco truck...",0
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"This is it everyone. It's the most authentic Mexican tacos I've had here in Cleveland. In the summer, you can find the taco cart out in front of this Mexican grocery store. They have 5 different types of meat and I have to say that my favorite is the Barbacoa - juicy fatty pork freshly heated up on the grill. Follow up favorites are the chorizo and al pastor.They also have some legit peppers on the side.

I wish they had a bigger salsa bar with the hot hot stuff, but they offer onions, cilantro, and a few different salsas.

This is our go to if we want some tacos. Those other places just don't have this kind of flavor!!!",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"What a great discovery to find that an authentic and truly delicious Taqueria is hidden inside of this awesome supermarket.  They've recently remodeled and moved the tacos into a larger area in front of the store.  This is clutch, as a huge reason most people come here is for the succulent perfectly seasoned tacos, which have tons of meat options to fill your tasty corn tortilla.  I ordered the chicken, barbacoa and carne asada.  You guys, I'm dying.  Every single meat was so tender.  Do they marinate these meats in amazing juices overnight?  I wouldn't be surprised.  I didn't calorie splurge on rice and beans, but they looked the bomb dot com.  Next time!

My favorite part was taking these meaty beasts to their necessary counterpart, the toppings station!  A million sauces, an out of this world guacamole sauce which was so creamy and flavorful, endless sour cream - okay, this girl's dream.  Chipotle peppery sauce, traditional Mexican hot sauce, onions, cilantro, lettuce, pico de gallo. I would have loved a bag of corn tortilla chips to make one bad ass nacho platter.  I need to inquire about that in the future.

The supermarket itself is everything you could want from an authentic Mexican food experience.  You need ingredients for tamales?  They got you.  You want some homemade pastries to sink your teeth into?  They're on it!  Perhaps it is a broad selection of hot sauces that you fancy.  No stress my amigos and amigas... the shelves are full and ready for you!

I'm really excited that I found out about this place since I lived in Albuquerque, New Mexico for a good chunk of my adult life and found some wonderful places like this there.  It's so good to find something similar because authentic Mexican food is everything that I love.

Thanks, La Plaza!!!",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"I had very high expectations for this place after reading all of the wonderful reviews but I was not all that impressed.  Our small group paid for the tacos inside and then walked over to the taco stand.  We ordered our tacos and then watched the staff cook uncooked meat right next to meat that was about to be served.  My first thought, cross contamination. Once the meat is placed in your corn tortillas you're encouraged to put vegetables (onions and cilantro) which are uncovered for who knows how long.  Each vegetable tray had plastic spoons inside, laying on top of the vegetables that were being offered to us.  My second thought, that's gross.  However, this did not stop me from piling on the veggies and a variety of sauces that they had to choose  from.  I normally will not eat after encountering situations such as these but I had to try the tacos because I've been searching for authentic tacos for years and I thought these were going to be it.  The tacos were good but not excellent.  Are they the best I've ever had?  No.  When you've traveled to Mexico and eaten tacos that were worth dying for, nothing seems to ever come close.  But wait there's more... within 20 minutes of eating my tacos, I was one very sick girl.  My stomach was not happy, I was nauseous, and felt extremely sick.  Because of how sick I felt, I will never visit again.",0
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,I can't believe how hard it is to get authentic ethnic food here in Cleveland. Thank the lord & the ladies at La Plaza for this taco cart. The food is legit. The food is good. The payment is cash. Toppings are unlimited but don't go crazy or you won't be able to pick up your taco. Faceplanting is always an option though.,1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"Cleveland is saturated with ""over complex"" and ""foodie"" tacos.  Here's the deal they're over rated, they all suck, and are typically served  cold ...cough cough (BARRIO)...A taco should never be varied from the simple basis that makes a taco a taco. 

At La plaza you get exactly what you want when you're craving a taco.  A traditional corn tortilla with your choice of tender meat that exudes nothing but mouth watering authenticity.  They're salsa bar is always on point, pairing fresh cilantro, chopped white onions, fresh limes, and now they're serving glazed jalepinos and pearl onions all at no additional charge, for get about it.  This is the only place I go for legit authentic tacos. They've never let me down...if I'm in the mood for disappointment and regret I go down the street to Barrio.",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"So good I came here for tacos two days in a row. 
The tacos are simple, authentic, and incredibly delcious. I had carnitas, barbacoa, and chorizo. I washed it down with a large Horchata, but if that's not your thing grab any of their various flavored bottled mexican soda. 

Inside they have a variety of fresh and unique produce (think various cactus, fruits, etc.). They also have an ample supply of bakery, dried chili peppers, a wonderful meat section, tons of Goya products, and fresh salsas and guacamole sold in containers alongside a variety of tortilla. I grabbed a coconut and mango jello and made some at home for dessert!

Brought my hard-to-impress dad here and he's still raving about it.

So glad I found this place!",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"I don't usually write reviews but I am SO SO SO happy to have found this place that I have to! I love going to random ethnic grocery stores and walking down all the aisles and poking at things, wondering how I can prepare it at home.

Turns out, this place is AWESOME for that! The employees are all so helpful and nice. I looked at the spices section, trying to figure out how I can make a certain side dish and an employee came up and started helping me. Then later, I grabbed some marinated meats and the butcher was incredibly friendly. The prices are pretty cheap too--I've gone to Trader Joe's and the prices are 75-100% higher (I know TJ's isn't ""authentic"" but bear with me, I hadn't found a Hispanic market in Cleveland before today). I headed over to the taco section. The woman helping me was so friendly. It was next to the bakery section and I've never seen some of those pastries before. I asked her to tell me what everything was and she stepped away from the taco counter and told me. So. Nice.

I bought quite a lot of groceries for one person so I doubt I'll be back in the next week, but I definitely will be back ASAP.",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"Thank you Lord!!! Having lived in Oklahoma
City and Washington state, where authentic taco trucks abound, then coming back to Cleveland to find little, to no food trucks, was a sad reality! 

These are REAL tacos! If you've never had an authentic taco, do yourself a favor and head over to La Plaza and order some! We will definitely be back A LOT!",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"Very authentic. If you get a burrito they will put the toppings on for you, but if you get tacos you will put on the toppings. They are extremely hot, fresh off the grill, I burned myself because they were so good! These are so authentic you will be so happy you came here. The grocery store is great. The grocery store accepts credit cards but the taco stand does not.",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"Hands down the best tacos in Cleveland!  If you go anywhere else, you are seriously wasting your time!  If you are looking for real authentic Mexican tacos look no further, La Plaza is the real deal.

When arriving to La Plaza, head straight to the back of the store where you will find an order counter and small seating area.  The sign says cash only, but if you don't carry cash, you can place your order, and then pay with a credit card at the front register instead.  

They sell all kinds of Mexican food, but let's be real, I'm here for the tacos!  I've tried all of their tacos, and all are delicious!  My favorite though, is definitely the steak tacos.  The meat is perfectly seasoned, and it just melts in your mouth.  Bonus, the tacos are only $2.50 each!  If your eating on a budget, this is the place for you.  The best part of this whole experience is the complimentary topping bar!  Load those tacos up and don't be shy!  The topping bar includes: onion, cilantro, limes, cabbage, radish, salsa, salsa verde, avocado crema and chipotle crema.  It's seriously the best $7.50 will ever spend on a meal.

I highly recommend La Plaza to all my taco loving friends!  I'm pretty much a regular here now, so if you don't see me here on taco Tuesday's, something is probably wrong and please send help! LoL",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,I was born and raised just minutes from the Mexican border in Ca. We have been in Ohio searching for authentic Mexican food. We have been to many many different locations and this is the closest to authentic we could find !,1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"Best burrito in town! This place is authentic. I'm
never going to Chipotle again after coming here!",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"Usually have a strict no gas station sushi or old super market taco rule...but there is an exception to every rule, well maybe not the gas station sushi. Place is everything you want to see in an authentic Mexican taco - old grandma that barely speaks English -fresh cilantro, onion, salsa, side sauces -2.50 a taco -sketchy eating area.

I would change nothing.

Of all the variety of tacos I would probably say the carne asada is  my favorite, but I don't think you can really go wrong.",0
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"I cannot day enough good things about this place. Nowhere in CLE is there a taco place that can stand toe to toe with la plaza. Even before their renovations they were they best around, actually wish they had kept it that way as now there always seems to be a crowd/line  but always worth the wait for authentic tacos. They also sell really good marinated  chicken and pork in the back! Definitely recommend",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"HOLY TACO!

I drive up to this little supermarket to see the taco cart out front. $2.50 per taco? What a steal.

These are the real deal guys. Two layered corn tortillas and the meat of your choice (I for one love the pastor and chicken). The coolest part? They have a cart specifically for toppings, so you can just load up on all the cilanto, onion, guacamole and salsa, free of charge. 

Best tacos in the city of Cle, hands down. The authenticity of the tacos is beyond compare. 

I'll be going here weekly now, no question about it.",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,Most authentic tacos in Cleveland. Had the bbq pork and shredded beef. Decent amount of meat and they have a topping station. Cash only $3 each,1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,Dude.  Burritos the size of footballs and the best authentic Mexican tacos you're gonna find.  Dude...,1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"This is a great find! This is the only real authentic Mexican Food I have found on the West Side. I would know, I am from Mexico!",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"This place looks intimidating but don't be fooled! My friend waited for me in the parking lot because she wasn't sure if it was the right place. Yes- it is!! 
This is THE place with the authentic tacos and Mexican food. 
Head to the back of this grocery store to the hot food counter. (Take note of the awesome baked goods on the right side of the aisle on your way there!) You'll find a great mix of prepared foods ready to grab and go or order for lunch there (or also to go). This is where the magic happens. 

Tacos are $2.50 each. My favorites are the carnitas, the (new) pulled chicken and the barbacoa. But honestly, they are all good! I usually get three tacos because yum! They are plain with just the meat (authentic) and you have to add the salsas, cilantro, onions etc from the salsa bar to the right. Don't get me started on the avocado salsa. I want to steal the whole bottle. Every. Single. Time.

Tacos are great but burritos are so epic! Yes, epic. They are huge! At 7.50 you will easily gorge yourself or have two to three meals. But they are delicious! Choice of meat- then they add cheese, beans, rice, lettuce, onion, sour cream, slices of avocado... I opt for no onions but that's me. Chipotle burritos will never be the same after you enjoy this delight. 
The tortas are also awesome- same idea as the burritos but on a fresh baked bun. Many people don't know tortas and even think- beans on bread? Or just why? But let me tell you- if you like burritos, this is just another version of the goodness. 
Oh and they JUST ADDED corn to the menu. Sounds lame but it is Mexican corn-- get a huge cup mixed with cotija cheese, lime, butter and a little mayo for $2. I dream of this corn!
Also, grab some goods to take home. Fresh tamales! Yesssss! I always order a few dozen for Christmas parties too. Order ahead if you want a lot of one kind to make sure they are there. 
Grab a pound of carnitas meat ($7.99 lb) and then head all the way to the left and grab fresh salsas and guacamoles packaged up in containers. Amazing fresh corn tortillas available over there too for a nominal fee. 

Basically, the possibilities here are endless just in the hot food. Not to mention the awesome stuff throughout the aisles. And the people who work here are so nice and kind. Don't worry if you don't speak Spanish (they will help you) or have to read from this review to order- if you want some amazing Mexican food, this is the place.",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"This place is as good as the hype. 
Small food section attached to a pretty large supermarket (with tons of homemade tortillas, chips, guacamole and various Mexican sodas/snacks) 
This place reminds me of places I go to in Cali. Mom and pop with just good food for cheap. 
A lot of their clientele are Mexican so you know it's authentic. They even say it's the best!
I would recommend the torta as well as the nachoes! But bring a friend or two because the quantity is insane.",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"La Plaza isn't here for the thrills or the bells and whistles...but being a Texan who used to live in Mexico...this is the only place in TOWN where you can get an authentic taco...and you know your girl looked first thing after moving to The Land. And when you can order...and sometimes HAVE to order in Spanish ....you know what IT IS. 

*Don't worry you get by without Spanish...just point :)",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"After just getting back from Costa Rica I was anxious to visit La Plaza and find some local favorites. I didn't find many local Costa Rican favorites, but I did enjoy the authentic mexican bakery and produce! I've shopped here before when making mexican themed dinner, and I always get excited to see the fresh produce...cactus leaves!  I picked up some corn mesa flour to make my tortilla's and Lizano sauce to put on everthing! We stopped for a taco on our way out which was amazing and had a line out the door. Loved the condiment bar!",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,There's no comparison to how delicious these tacos are at the stand. Very authentic and addicting. I like that you can add your own toppings at the bar and their red sauce is so good!  Workers and cooks are always super nice and I like supporting a local grocery store.,1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"These are the most authentic tacos you'll find in Cleveland! If you are looking for specialty foods/snacks/ingredients, the supermarket it is connect to provides, but has a small selection if you are looking for general groceries.

The barbecued pork (al pastor) was by far my favorite taco. All of it was just really fresh, made to order with the right temperature and plenty of ingredients (salsa, onion, radish, lime, etc.,) at the bar to choose from. This is worth the drive out from Barrio!",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"Finally part of Mexico has arrived in Cleveland. You can get authentic tacos at this hidden gem inside of the Mexican supermarket in Cleveland. People have said these are the best tacos in Cleveland. Although I enjoyed the tacos, I wouldn't say they are the best...yet. Tacos are made fresh and on the spot in minutes and the best part is the salsa/topping bar where you can add to and build on top of your own tacos to customize it to your taste buds!",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"As a California native who's been on the hunt for tacos since day one of moving here, I can definitely vouch for La Plaza's as the most authentic that Cleveland has to offer out of the many places I've tried across town. I've been here multiple times for both dine-in and take-out, and the al pastor, steak, barbacoa and carnitas are always consistent in taste and quality. Well-stocked toppings bar with 5 types of salsa, cilantro, limes and delicious avocado and chipotle crema - only wish they also offered extra pineapples for the al pastor!  

Wait times are always short, making it a good place to sit down and eat even if you're stopping by in a hurry. In addition to having the best tacos you'll find in the city, this place is also attached to a Mexican supermarket that carries a wide selection of classics like Jarritos, Inca Cola, Goya foods, freshly made guac and glass bottle Cokes in case you're craving other Latin-American favorites after getting that taco fix!",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"Oh my gosh I only have amazing things to say about this place. These tacos are probably the most authentic I've seen in Cleveland. I was really on the hunt for some more authentically styled tacos since living in Mexico for a few months, and I am so happy I found this place. 

It's connected to a grocery store which really sets the vibe for this place. I came on a vegan night/event where La Plaza was trialing some solid vegan options. I ended up getting a couple of the meat taco options instead (can't quite remember which ones) but all of them were great. They came in double layered corn tortillas which I loved. I also really liked that they had a toppings bar on the side so I could pick and choose which toppings and how much I wanted to add for each. Salsa was great and I'm a huge fan of cilantro on my tacos. 

It's a little bit of a drive from where I am but I loved the food and vibes of this place and will be coming back multiple times for sure. Highly recommend!!!",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,They put Muenster cheese in their Torta's when it's supposed to be Oaxaca cheese same goes for quesadillas. Their Taco's are not authentic. I don't even know why they say it's Mexican food because it's just Americanized nothing else.,0
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,A great place for authentic Mexican. They have multiple options at a reasonable price. I love their salsa and sauces!,1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"Haven't had authentic tacos like this since when I lived in California. I moved to the Midwest in 2014 and have struggled to find authentic tacos like the ones I grew up with in California ever since - I failed to find any when I lived in Kentucky but now that I'm in Cleveland, I think I've found my place. 

These tacos are simple in nature - corn tortillas with a meat of your choice - exactly how it should be. The real treasure lies in the toppings bar they have, where you have your choice of at least 5 different salsas, finely chopped cilantro, onions, guacamole, lime, and a fabulous chipotle crema that blows my mind every time. My favorite is their chorizo, but I can attest that the Barbacoa, carnitas,  and carne carne are also delicious. I wasn't a fan of the chicken but that is just personal preference. 

If you like delivery, they deliver very well also and as long as you specify what you want, they'll add in your toppings as well. 

As for the supermarket portion, the selection is fabulous. I love to get my spices here for the sheer variety they offer. Truly a wonderful spot, 10/10 would recommend!",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"La Plaza supermarket is a hidden gem, with authentic tacos tucked away  inside a very fresh market. Menu is super simple and straight to the point (we tried al pastor, asada, barbacoa, and a chicken quesadilla, all amazing), and needless to say after quickly downing those, got back up to order another round of al pastor tacos, which I'd say was my favorite. I also have only good things to say about the other tacos - all the meats were fresh, each taco was served at a great temperature, and with a flavorful, crisp corn tortilla. The other amazing thing about this place is the salsa bar (good variety of mild to spicy) which lets you pack on as much fresh salsa, toppings, and grilled/pickled peppers as you want. Absolutely spec-taco-lar! Would definitely take the 20 min drive to come back again and hopefully try their soups.",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"Oh your favorite taco place is Barrio? That's cute. How about we slap some real authentic delicious tacos inside your mouth then see how you feel. Holy sweet baby Mexican Jesus! Sure it's at the back of a supermarket, sure it's hard to communicate if you can't speak Spanish, but the tacos are simple, tasty and only $2.50 each! 

The sign at the back says cash only, but you can pre-order your tacos at the lottery desk in the front and pay by card. Also, don't be intimidated if you don't speak Spanish, just smile and you'll get a warm smile in return from everyone, plus we all speak the language of food, they know what you're in there for and they're ready to give it to you. Have them load you up with all five taco offerings. Trust me, you won't regret it. 

Don't forget to add toppings like cilantro, lime juice, diced onion, guac or this yummy orange sauce to your tacos! Oh and do check out their other offerings like tamales, I haven't tried mine yet, but they look like a win! Actually don't come here, I don't want to share.",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,The BEST and most authentic tacos in Cleveland. You can order it fresh and fast with ample toppings. Price is perfect for what you get. Highly recommend!,1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"Amazing tacos! Full stop. I grew up in Arizona so I miss authentic Mexican food.  The barbacoa was out of this world good.  I also tried the carne asada, which was fantastic, but the barbacoa blew me away.  The salsa bar was fully stocked with all you need, including cilantro and onions.  The supermarket itself is pretty great as well.  We grabbed a dozen pork and chicken tamales and were definitely happy campers the next day at dinnertime.  I've been wanting to get to La Plaza for years. I definitely will not be waiting long to go back.",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,This is the most authentic Mexican food in the Cleveland area. If you are familiar with Chicago and have had Mexican food there you know what I mean (with exception that they add rice here in their burritos). The burritos are HUGGGE!!! The food is well seasoned. I will say that they do not use flank or skirt steak but still pretty good. Bill was $32 for 2 burritos and a torts plus 2 waters. You do have to wait some time for your food to be prepared as it is very busy; line often out the door. It is a la cartel type ordering with some seating available. They grocery section is pretty good but pricey.,1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"This place is a gem. I shop here at least once a month to stock up on pounds of fresh serrano peppers, dried ancho chiles, cascabels, guajillos, pasilla, etc. The produce is good, cheap, and you'll find stuff there you won't find in other grocery stores like epazote. Fantastic place to have within a five minute drive for a pepper head like myself. As a hot sauce lover, I come here to restock on my favorite varieties of El Yucateco, Tapatio, and Valentina.

Their bakery selection looks good, but all I've ever tried is the Cuban bread--great for making Banh Mi and Cuban sandwiches.

Great selection of tortillas, authentic Mexican cheese, and canned Mexican produce.

I love this place as a grocery store first and foremost, and as a taqueria as an afterthought. That being said, the tacos are the most authentic tacos I've ever had in Cleveland, and I've been to taco stands in San Diego where I was the only white guy around. Don't be afraid to try the lengua (beef tongue) tacos; they're delicious.

Going to go here this weekend and try to pick up everything I need to make mole.",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"Looking for real authentic street style Mexican food! Well you've come to the right place! None of that American flour tortilla stuff, posing as the real deal! Forget the big fancy ""Mexican spots"" Clevelanders love, and just go to this place!",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,Got the burrito for lunch and it did not disappoint. $10 is on the high end for a burrito but everything tasted wonderful and authentic. Would definitely recommend,1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"giving 4 star because of price. they deff went up. way over priced for some tacos and burritos. $3 dollars for a taco?! and $10 bucks for a burrito?! i mean i can get super good, cheap, and authentic tacos in california cheaper than this. but tacos are great every time, pretty close to your authentic street tacos. friendly people and the market is great. glad to see them expand the small taco stand in the back corner to the front now. but this is a good place for tacos in the cleveland area.",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"Two words...TACO TUESDAY! Actually, if you've been around and have had authentic Mexican food, this place freaking rocks! I have to admit that I don't want people crowding me out of there, but I deserve it if I don't get there early enough!",1
TKaND6oV1n2ylnCYoAfoag,"I have been on a TACO eating streak recently with visits to Blue Habanero a few months ago and then eating at Barrio a few days ago (read those reviews of mine). Now, I just tried what others call the best tacos in Cleveland - that is, the tacos here at La Plaza Supermarket. In my opinion, they are not the best tacos in Cleveland but I'll have to come back to try more.

This is a supermarket that has a small restaurant at the back. The restaurant sells tacos, burritos, and all sorts of Mexican staple dishes.

TACOS -- So I ate at Barrio for the first time on Thursday, 30 May 2019 and I ate here at La Plaza today (Sunday, 2 June 2019). The tacos here at La Plaza are super small, little did I know until I received my tacos. I was still very hungry after eating both tacos. The tacos came in a soft tortilla.

I ordered the steak taco and the beans taco. The steak taco was delicious and it helped that I dipped it into some hot salsa/sauce. The beans taco was okay. The beans did not have much flavour and it tasted just like canned beans. I'm used to the way my mom makes beans in seasoning (the African way). 

For $3, the tacos were REALLY small which is why I prefer Barrio. At Barrio, the tacos there are much bigger and tastes just as good as these. I'm a simple person who loves good food (haha). I'm not high maintenance. The tacos here did taste authentic I guess but it wasn't extremely the best tacos ever as other Yelp reviewers have stated. This is just my opinion. 

SUPERMARKET -- I briefly walked around the market. They sell all of your typical grocery store items like meats, snacks, drinks, etc. At the back of the market is a dessert section which they bake fresh everyday. I bought a churro when I arrived in the evening. I was VERY disappointed in the taste especially after spending $1.35 on it. This was my 2nd time tasting a churro so I was super excited to buy it. It was very bland and not edible. My friend commented that it was probably sitting out the whole day but even if it came out freshly baked/fried, I would not have liked the taste. It was not sweet at all and it was very doughy inside. My first time tasting a churro was at Puente Viejo Mexican restaurant which is in downtown Cleveland (read my Yelp review from Nov. 2018). Now those churros were fresh, sweet, and delicious. Unfortunately, I wouldn't recommend the churros here at La Plaza Supermarket.

Parking here is on a small lot attached next to the store. The market sits on a quiet neighbourhood street surrounded by homes. I encourage you to visit and try the cafe food for yourself or go grocery shopping. 

I'll be back for some tacos for sure but not anytime soon considering how small they are for the price. Maybe I will order a burrito next time.

When it comes to the food stand, they serve up the heartiest of tacos loaded with meet on corn tortillas. You complete the taco yourself by picking out toppings at the bar and dressing it how you please. Sour cream guacamole all the salsas cilantro onion... take your choice. The menu features more than tacos as well. Tortas, nachos and more... check it out, you will not be disappointed. Out of the Chorizo, Carne Asada and Al Pastor: the chorizo is the best. 

If you decide your meal is delicious you can walk right into the market and buy all the fixings to make your own at home!!!",1

Tm2dKN_-DCdZfF2xMWrX7w,"The absolute best Chinese food in Cleveland. 
My family and I have been frequenting Siam for 5 or so years now, every time, we receive outstanding food and service. This is the only place I ever ask to go on my birthday and I celebrated at Siam on the occasion of my high school graduation.  
Don't be fooled by its shady look! The food is as authentic and delicious as it gets. Curry Vegetables, Bubble Tea, and the Pork Buns are always crowd pleasers. 
Huge platters of food allow for family-style sharing. Because having a conversation and trying new things is what this is all about in the end, right?",1
Tm2dKN_-DCdZfF2xMWrX7w,"The looks of this restaurant from the inside is quite different from the outside shady look. When you enter you just feel the authentic Thai seafood ambience across. The decoration and the servers give you the typical Thai experience that you expected.

The food is authentic, delicious and fresh. Being the typical Indians, we ordered the tom yum shrimp and mushroom soup, basil and grounded chicken(asked them to make it spicy) and a vegetable fried rice. The flavors were to the taste- I especially liked the basil and grounded chicken and would definitely order it next time I visit this place.

Overall we had a great experience here and the restaurant is open till midnight which in itself is very unique.",1
Tm2dKN_-DCdZfF2xMWrX7w,"This is literally the only restaurant I have ever eaten at in the Cleveland area. It wasn't in the nicest part of town. It wasn't the nicest looking restaurant. It wasn't the nicest ambiance (in fact the elevator music was downright annoying). But that which matters most, the food, was delicious and satisfying. Siam Cafe bills itself as a seafood restaurant and the menu certainly has plenty of options from fish, shrimp, and lobster to more exotic (and authentic) fare like jellyfish and frog. There is also the full range of more familiar Americanized dishes. We had a very Thom Yum soup, then a delicious peppered beef and sweet and sour chicken (nicely done without the often excessive amount of breading). The friendly and attentive staff cemented my feeling that should I ever return to Cleveland, I would gladly eat here again.",1
Tm2dKN_-DCdZfF2xMWrX7w,"Completely amazing. I'm not Asian, but Siam Cafe makes me wish I was!  The Pan Fried Noodles (well-done) with Pork and Vegetables are probably best thing I have ever eaten in my life.  I am kind of obsessed.  Also, their green tea is like crack to me.

The service is really good - everyone is very friendly and the wait staff work together to ensure you have everything that you need.  They box up leftovers in appropriate sized containers and wrap them with plastic bags with smiley faces on them.  So cute. 

You know it's fresh:  The live fish, crabs, and eel are on display in large aquariums in the back of the restaurant.  If you want delicious Chinese food (that consists of more than just General Tso and fried rice delivered to your door), Siam Cafe is probably your best bet. And, you'll be surrounded by a lot of Asian families and students, which makes the experience feel more authentic.",1
Tm2dKN_-DCdZfF2xMWrX7w,"My family and I have been going here for years for our get togethers. The have quite a diverse menu of Chinese, Thai, and Vietnamese dishes.  Portions are large and the food is very consistent.  Service is always great and the place is really packed on weekends.

They have fresh, live tilapia, flounder, crab, and lobster in the tanks in the dining room.  We typically order the family style Chinese dinners which come with soup, an assortment of entrees that you can pick from, and sweet taro tapioca for dessert.  If you don't like any of the family dinner menu choices, substitutions are no problem!  My family really likes their Pad Thai, fried whole chicken, and the Beef Tenderloin with Asian Greens. The fried tofu squares and Walnut Shrimp are really good too!  The also have a nice bubble tea selection.

Stop in for some tasty and fairly authentic Asian fusion nomz!  Nomnomnom!",1
Tm2dKN_-DCdZfF2xMWrX7w,"Of the handful of Chinese restaurants in Cleveland, this one seems to be the most mediocre.

Tm2dKN_-DCdZfF2xMWrX7w,"One of my favorite Asian restaurants in Cleveland. A pretty aggressive menu and while not fully authentic certainly not a suburban strip mall Asian spot. Portions are large and reasonably priced. Dishes are  perfect for sharing. Decor needs to be updated but I guess that and the location keep the prices down. Just don't expect a fancy joint. I have been to Siam's countless times and have never been disappointed. My favorite dishes are the Baby Bok Choy, Cumin Lamb, duck choo Chee and ground basil chicken.

Tm2dKN_-DCdZfF2xMWrX7w,"What to say that the other 189 reviews haven't? I'm into this place. 

No complaints about the food. The dishes weren't the best I've ever had, but they were good! Peking duck. Tom yum. Beef ho fun. Massaman curry. Bun Thit. Spicy Cabbage. Pho. EVERYTHING GET IN MY BELLY!!! But really, don't be expecting some Americanized Chinese food BS. I'm sure they have some of that on their menu but really, it seems they stick to authentic recipes mostly. Also, the dish I ordered they listed as spicy but it was not spicy at all. Very delicious!

Tm2dKN_-DCdZfF2xMWrX7w,"Really decent Chinese food in Cleveland. My wife and I come here whenever we come to Cleveland to get some Chinese-made seafood and bubble tea. The restaurant is usually quite crowded on weekends so you may want to go early or be prepared to wait a little bit. This time, we ordered the salt/pepper pork chops and ginger/scallion lobster. The lobster was quite fresh and was excellently prepared. As most Chinese restaurants, you get quite a lot for your money. And the food is comparable to anything that I might get in California. So its a great place to go when we get cravings for authentic Chinese food. The only issue this time was that we were in a part of the restaurant where it was difficult to get the attention of the wait staff.",1

The menu ranged from authentic Chinese, Thai, and Vietnamese to the americanized Chinese food and they are all quite delicious. The portions are huge and the pricing was spot on. Great wait staff as well. If you can't decide between Thai or Chinese food, why have to decide when you can come here and have both.",1

Tm2dKN_-DCdZfF2xMWrX7w,"Siam Cafe is the most authentic Asian restaurant in the Cleveland area. The food comes out hot and the service is very good. It can get busy on weekends but the wait is worth it (and usually no longer than 20 mins). They have both authentic Asian food or more americanized Asian food. Their dinner for 4, 8, or 12 is very well priced and their portions are large.",1
Tm2dKN_-DCdZfF2xMWrX7w,"Been back several times including a 3 PM Sunday dinner all by my lonesome this past weekend. I'm sorry but you really can not go wrong here. I got Viet hot and sour soup, and beef lemongrass curry salad. Soup had nice shrimp and a little kick. The salad has stir fried beef with mild curry and lemon grass, Lettuce, rice noodles, peanuts, sweet pickled carrots and radish. This is one of my favorites. Excellent every time. Icing on the cake  all for about 10$. I have ordered  this salad at different establishments and this is by far the best. The time previous to this my friend ordered the jelly fish, It was pretty good, kind of hard to describe. Crunchy but in a woodear mushroom kind of way, very neutral taste, taking on the flavor of the spicy sesame oil and soy that it was flavored with. Not sure if this the way it is supposed to be but it was good none the less. Other mentionables are the Pad Thai,any of the salads, the crepe, garlic chicken, many of the curries, the pho is decent, anything in a black bean sauce, basil chicken, most of the soups and the hotpots( you had better ask what come in those) 
The service is some of the best I have had in an Asian restaurant in Cleveland, I'm not trying to go ""there"" but you know what I mean. Very attentive and able to answer questions, they have a team approach, anyone will fill your water or clear plates. I'm pretty sure if you have not had a good meal here you might be getting the wrong things. I always ask for light oil if I get anything authentic that is Chinese, not sure why there is a need for copious amounts of oil!",1
Tm2dKN_-DCdZfF2xMWrX7w,I really like this place. The food is very authentic and the flavor is phenomenal. I love the house fried rice and the beef with ginger and chives. Best Asian restaurant in Cleveland.,1

My family and I are frequent diners here and we know the staff well. I've tried just about everything on their menu and while I have my favorites, there is nothing that I haven't liked. The Pho is good, and if you aren't feeling too conscious about your health... try what I consider to be some Asian comfort food, which is anything fried. My favorites include the spicy salt-baked squid , shrimp or scallops.",1

Tm2dKN_-DCdZfF2xMWrX7w,"Yelp won't leave me alone until I write this review. (Back up off me, Yelp!)

First, I'll say this. The only reason we went to Siam Cafe was because Wonton BBQ was closed. Sorry, truth. BUT!!!!!.... I'm not sad about it. Siam was very good.

My family and I were the only non-Asians in the whole place. Very good sign. 

The menu is overwhelming. One of the only things I didn't like, but that's to be expected at a place that offers so many different types of authentic Asian noms. 

Everything was supremely fresh. They even have fish in tanks that you'll later see on your plate! Tons of fish. Lobsters and frogs, too. Oh, I'm sorry. Did that make you squeamish? Muahahaha! Too bad. 

Portions are out of control huge. I went with four family members and we all ordered an entree and had boxes and boxes of leftovers to take home. Plus, we got a few appetizers and soups, too. We're all fat but that was way too much even for us chubbies. 

Service was wonderful. They really catered to my bratty child and brought out his pho almost right away. And they didn't mind that he insisted on standing by the fish tanks for a big chunk of the time we were there. 

I'm trying to get back soon to try more of their rotund menu.",0
Tm2dKN_-DCdZfF2xMWrX7w,"Siam Cafe probably has the most authentic Cantonese Chinese food that you can find in Ohio that's not required to special order. My parents will request that we go to Siam Cafe whenever they come visit me from Columbus. Most of the food is usually spot on, i've never had a bad meal here, except that sometimes when I order a dish it'll be different (meaning sweeter and too much sauce) that how it's usually prepared Cantonese style, and it's mainly vegetable dishes that i've had this problem with. Be adventurous and go with the non-americanized dishes please!",1
Tm2dKN_-DCdZfF2xMWrX7w,"Wow, what can I say about this place that hasn't already been said. I literally drive to Cleveland just to eat here. First, I love how there's a blend of authentic dishes from several aspects of Eastern Asia. The fresh fried squid is absolutely amazing. Light and not overly greasy...perfectly crispy. There are amazing tofu casseroles, as well. I've tried the spicy black pepper sauce beef short ribs, which are amazing. The noodle dishes are spectacular. I usually don't get fried rice dishes, but the Thai fried rice was light yet had great flavor. I could go on and on, but you can't go wrong with any dish on the menu.",1

Tm2dKN_-DCdZfF2xMWrX7w,"Don't go for ambiance, don't go for Thai food.

Order your typical americanized Chinese dish, enjoy the usually fast but impersonal service, and be glad that a city like the Cleve has an Asiatown in an area that is otherwise kinda ghetto. they have a big menu but this is simply not the kind of place I'm ordering seafood, despite the countless selections. And if you get bored at this place, head over to Payne Avenue's Wonton Gourmet for a change of pace and perhaps slightly more authentic fare (slightly).

My go-to ""Chinese"" restaurant.",0
Tm2dKN_-DCdZfF2xMWrX7w,"This place is very delicious and extremely authentic. I always get the thai eggplant everytime I'm in. There's shrimp, minced meat and eggplant. So delicious! 

But my favorite thing in the place is the free dessert taro soup that they bring out at the end of the meal! Be sure to ask them for it if they don't bring it immediately. It's the perfect bit of sweetness for after dinner.

The service is very good and you can come with a lot of people even on short notice. The prices are fair and the portions are large. The waiters are always very considerate to check if you need anything. I suppose speaking Chinese may help you with your transaction, but in general, they are very good. 

Definitely a go to place (but beware if you're intolerant of MSG...there's definitely some lurking in some of the dishes).",1

Tm2dKN_-DCdZfF2xMWrX7w,"One of the greatest authentic Chinese restaurants I have been to so far in Cleveland.
Nothing beats the great price and food on the menu and the amount of food you actually
get. I would recommend Beef Chow Fun, Peking Duck, Fried Rice of any kind and also
spring rolls.

 Owner is very friendly and helpful, I go here quite a lot and most often order beef chow
fun since it is my favorite dish and trust me it is a very large serving for only around $8.95 or close to that price.

 I will visit over and over again when I feel like eating Chinese food, the place is much cleaner, friendlier and brighter than Bo Loong which is across the street and the owners actually
care about their customers, whenever I go to Bo Loong I feel like the owners are very ill
mannered and don't care about their non Asian customers.",1
Tm2dKN_-DCdZfF2xMWrX7w,"I have been eating here for 25 years and travel the world for business and pleasure. I have eaten Tai, Vietnamese, Cambodian and Chinese all over the world. This place is still my favorite... The dishes are fresh and cooked to order. The dishes are authentic.. Live seafood including sea bass, flounder, lobster and crab. Put it this way-- the Asian Americans come here from all over the region. You won't find better. And the family that owns it are the best! 10 out of 10. Anyone who gives it less is just looking for something to bitch about..

So caution to the to the timid... This place specializes inauthentic food. The do have the boring, Americanized Chinese for the chickens out there. Sweet and sour, general Taos, won ton, blah blah blah.. And everyone on here who rates this place one or 2 stars seems to order this stuff. This is NOT their speciality because it is American food.

Be brave. All the chefs specials are good. All the curries are authentic. The noodle dishes are wonderful.  And if you are very brave, experiment with some of the very traditional pot dishes.",1

I love the eggplant dish (yu shang qie zi - yum), beef cutlets (niu zai pai gu), fried tofu with shrimp, salt and pepper squid, walnut shrimp, pot full of seafood (ok, I don't really know what it's called!) and beef pan-fried noodles. I'd like to think they make it more authentic for me when I try ordering in Chinese. (see note.) 

I'm impressed that Siam is open until midnight every night. I think the Chinese restaurants in Cleveland are some of the only establishments open this late!

Note: My pinyin is horrible.. my spoken Mandarin is worse. But I try, and the waiter I know always feels pity and gives my party a free round of tapioca/red bean desserts.",1

Try the goi con ( Vietnamese spring rolls, best in the city), Crab stuffed fried tofu ( oh man..w/ perfect ginger sauce), and any seafood and PHO'.

The duck is good, but not produced on site. Don't order the fried noodles; very oily.

The portions are pretty generous and the prices are reasonable. There are some more americanized food, but that's fine since there's a lot of variety.

The service is usually really good (friendly and fast). The only complain is that one time the waiter recommended the fish and it was  pretty bad (and relatively expensive).

5 stars for being in cleveland.",1
Tm2dKN_-DCdZfF2xMWrX7w,"this is probably the most legit Chinese restaurant in Cleveland. why? because they have freaking real seafood like lobsters and steamed flounders!

my friends and I went there right after Chinese new year and this place was packed. we waited for 45 minutes even with a reservation. the service was pretty good, albeit their busy schedule. they may not be as busy during other times tho. 

food recommended: lobster with ginger and scallions - pretty good, no other comment. one small lobster is prob 24 bucks and one large one is prob 50+. hot basil chicken - this is not really a Chinese dish but it was really really good!! steamed flounder - you have to order a steamed fish dish there because there is no where else in Cleveland as far as I know that has this kind of dish, very authentic. pork shank- this baby is huge! I thought the flavor was pretty close to the ones I had in China but I think the skin could be a littleee more fried and the color could be darker. the sauteed squid or spare ribs were both pretty meh - not recommended. the sour and spicy potato slices is a pretty Chinese dish that I didn't see anywhere else in Cleveland, highly recommended! walnut shrimp - this is not a mainland dish I suppose, maybe a Taiwanese thing? but it was ok its kinda cold. beef noodle chao niu he - this is a really Chinese dish as well, pretty well done!

as you can tell, this restaurant is pretty much like a real restaurant that can survive in China. It is also not very MSG charged, unlike Szechuan and wonton, which showed their confidence in their dishes. thumbs up!",1
Tm2dKN_-DCdZfF2xMWrX7w,"Far from tasty. I can forgive not authentic Chinese food but that's not even American Chinese food.

I first knew this place was great when realizing there were more Asians here than any other ethnicity. That should tell you something about the authenticity of the food. Tables filled with families drinking, being loud and joyful. 

The service is what you would expect in Asia Town, attentive and to the point. The food though, for me personally is quite exceptional. The seafood is always fresh which I appreciate, and they always keep the tea coming.

Nostalgia runs high for me personally at Siam CafÁE©, but I would never let that detour me from honesty. With that being said, this place is awesome on so many levels and I highly recommend it.",1
Tm2dKN_-DCdZfF2xMWrX7w,"I can see why this place is so popular, they have a huge menu and everything I've tried has been pretty good. You can find Vietnamese, Thai and various Chinese cuisines here, especially Cantonese and American-Chinese.

The braised pork belly with taro is heavy and hearty, and I found it funny that a whole table of Chinese men were looking at me and laughing when it was placed in front of me. It's a huge bowl and there was no way I could eat it all. The pork melts in your mouth, and is very fatty...but why else would you want pork belly!? The taro is necessary here as it helps to cut the richness, and provides a nice texture and flavor as well. 

The fried pork chop with spiced salt is really good, but I was expecting more spice and salt. It was a little bland, but was still nice. 

My wife ordered pho, which I had doubts about since it's a mostly Chinese menu. She really enjoyed the pho, which is an indication of quality because she is Vietnamese and very critical about her food. She has also tried the Hu Tieu My Tho, which she wasn't a fan of. 

As for drinks, the jackfruit smoothie is really good, but the Thai Iced tea was a little bland. 

I recommend Siam, it's good for families, lovers of authentic Asian food and newbies to the scene as well.",1
Tm2dKN_-DCdZfF2xMWrX7w,"Literally have never been disappointed by a meal here. If we come with a group we get the (authentic) Asian family meal. Otherwise I hit up the Vietnamese section or the noodles. Staff is quick, attentive and helpful.",1
Tm2dKN_-DCdZfF2xMWrX7w,"Best Authentic Chinese Food In Cleveland!

All of the Chinese students and friends I know including myself who spent 22 years in China agree that Siam cafe has the best Chinese food in Cleveland. 

Recommend Basil Chicken, a little spicy but it's an unique dish that I can't find anywhere else, many of my friends make it a must-order dish at Siam cafe. Try Black pepper beef, seafood dish and Japanese toufu, or anything that's authentic Chinese dishes (no general Tsao's chicken, that's not real Chinese food!) They also have Chinese hotpotand other off-menu items.

Price is very fair, most dishes are priced at $10-15, we always have leftover cause the dish portion is so large, Siam cafe also provide free rice and dessert soup, which is also a plus.

Cons: The only dishes that disappoint me is the Singapore fried rice noodles, too oily and heavy curry flavor for me,  well it's not really Chinese dish so that doesn't change the fact that Siam cafe has the best Chinese food in Cleveland!!!",1
Tm2dKN_-DCdZfF2xMWrX7w,"Siam is paradise to me. I never bother to flip through their encyclopedia menu because I've been ordering exactly what my Chinese friends ordered during my very first visit in 2007. When I walk through Siam's doors, it's very routine: I'm greeted and promptly seated. I tell the server that I do not need a menu and would like to order the mayonnaise shrimp with candied walnuts, chicken/shrimp pad thai, and sesame chicken. In no more than 15 minutes, all three dishes are sitting piping hot before me. 

Let's start with my absolute favorite dish: mayonnaise shrimp with candied walnuts (it's funny how so many people are turned off by the simple fact that there's ""mayonnaise;"" you'll be absolutely shocked at how off your judgmental assumption was). About eight or so jumbo shrimp are perfectly fried, tossed in a tangy, creamy, and exotic mayonnaise-based sauce, laid on a bed of broccoli, and then topped with walnuts that have been cooked in sugar. It comes with a complimentary bowl of steamed white rice. I tried a popular recipe for this dish at home last week and it embarrassingly paled in comparison. This is one of their more expensive offerings ($15) but it is worth every cent considering its taste and the market-price of jumbo shrimp. It's always on my mind, and yes--I've accepted the fact that I'm an addict.

The pad thai is around 10 bucks and you get a very generous portion. I've never had it better anywhere else than at Siam. With some fresh lime, peanuts, and sriracha, you're in for one hell of a tasty treat. Same goes for the sesame chicken ($10)--chunky, crispy hunks of fried boneless chicken covered in a sweet, rich sauce and sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds. 

This place is always busy and full, but I somehow manage to wait for only about a minute to get a table. The servers are polite, hospitable, and clean. The venue is also clean, authentically decorated, and comfortable. The massive fish and lobster tanks add on to the great ambiance. Food, service, and big portions have been consistent for the 5 years that I've been here and I'll continue to be a Siam regular for a VERY long time!",1
Tm2dKN_-DCdZfF2xMWrX7w,I have tried two different entrees here (Basil Chicken and Emperor's Chicken) which were decent and reasonably priced.

Tm2dKN_-DCdZfF2xMWrX7w,"Siam CafÁE© is a favorite with Clevelanders who like Chinese, Cantonese, Thai and Vietnamese cuisine. They make many Chinese American favorites very well like sweet-and-sour chicken and General Tso's chicken but I would recommend going there and trying something from the authentic Chinese/Cantonese menu.  For example, try some of the stir fried snow pea tips (the tender shoots of the pea pod plant) with garlic.  Follow that with pork belly braised with taro root (which is what poi is made from). Enjoy ""wo Flavors"" fried rice, a large platter of fried rice topped on one half by a creamy sauce with juicy shrimp and the other half covered by a tangy chicken in tomato gravy. 

They serve some great Vietnamese dishes like pho (rice noodle soup) and bun (rice noodle bowls).   If you are craving Thai, they make a mean pad Thai and a really delicious hot basil chicken.  The hot basil chicken dish is comprised of minced chicken stirfry in hot spices which is accompanied by white rice.

They have a number of desserts but my favorite is to order something called ""sam sik bing"" which is a parfait that has various tropical fruits and jellies in a sweet coconut milk drink. They also have various flavors of bubble tea to satisfy your sweet tooth. ",1

i knew they'd like it but man they loved it.
we got fried noodles with bean sprouts, mapo tofu, braised tofu with snow peas, and bak choy. all delicious, light without being bland.
i live here so i eat in or get take out here every week. the braised tofu is my regular. it's pretty perfect as far as tofu goes. fried outside and silky on the inside with plenty of delicious sauce.
i stopped by for take out on christmas night, of course because it was one of two restaurants in the whole city that was open, the other one being boo long across the street, which is also delicious. it was packed! who knows, maybe it was all the jews, or the christians who didn't want honey baked ham, or just like me and my friends, dgaf about christmas.

I loved their black pepper scallops because the sauce was sweet and peppery, very different but good. Their cold platter was delicious, if you like jellyfish.
Staff was very nice and helpful in recommending dishes and accomodating! Their dishes are interesting because they have specific dishes for Thai, Chinese, Viet, and others, but they also have mixes of these culturally rich foods.
All of the dishes we got ranges from $13-$18. It was authentic and a pretty decent portion!
There's a parking lot and if you're not paying attention, you might pass this little gem. There's plenty of tables for a group of people and space for a small party. There are bathrooms in the back, bit no WiFi. Everything was great and I will come back every time we visit!",1

The restaurant has large tanks of fresh live seafood cooked to order and can prepare Asian specialty drinks like bubble tea.  Citing all the dishes I enjoy at Siam Cafe is like repeating most of their menu - but some favorites include crispy chicken, salt baked shrimp and squid,  Japanese tofu, egg plant with garlic sauce, double lobster, steamed whole fish, beef caserole, fried oysters, many delicious noodles, and lots of Chinese vegetables.  They do serve alcohol, but I usually get Thai iced tea, iced coffee with condensed milk, taro bubble tea, mango bubble tea... and the list goes on.  The restaurant is best enjoyed with large groups eating family style so multiple entres can be shared.  I have also gotten very large to-go party orders (~20 people) from Siam and they always do a great job with carry-out.

The portions were incredibly generous here. I ate until I was stuffed and still had enough leftovers for another full meal at home the next day. The raspberry margarita was really sweet and a little strong, but still tasty. Our waitress was great - and we had very fast service.

I've only been here once but will definitely return!",1
tNJgmbODR-N0qdPGy4Vsrw,"It is a favorite of mine for dinner. My only complaint would be that they do not serve homemade tortillas. I feel that tortillas are easy enough to make, that an authentic Mexican restaurant should offer them, even if they were to charge additional. They also have Pepsi products.",1
tNJgmbODR-N0qdPGy4Vsrw,"Hola!

El Jalepenos (should be Los) is definitely the authentic Mexican place that they claim to be.  Personally I think the food up the street at Luchitas is a bit better, but you can't beat the atmosphere here.   It starts with the waiters who speak just enough English to get your order right and ends with the giant glasses of margaritas.

If you are looking for a fun time with no pretense, this is a great place to kick-off your night.",1
tNJgmbODR-N0qdPGy4Vsrw,"The one place I miss now that I no longer live in Lakewood. The food tastes great at good prices. Nice selection of meals and drinks... daily specials too. The margarita's are strong, but taste great. Anyone giving this place below 4 stars is confused and thinks Taco Bell is authentic Mexican.",1
tNJgmbODR-N0qdPGy4Vsrw,"The authentic Mexican food brought us here, the plethora of margarita flavors and personal favorites such as chili rellenos combined with good service and very reasonable prices is what brings us back. Make sure to save room for the fried ice cream! You will be amazed.",1
tNJgmbODR-N0qdPGy4Vsrw,"Solid authentic Mexican food. I was turned off by the name, but the food is good. Taco bar for salsas and whatnot. Homemade chips. Solid margaritas. I say give it a go. Fast lunches, filling dinners.",1
tNJgmbODR-N0qdPGy4Vsrw,"We started out joking that they should have just called it ""EL KLUCK'S"" or ""Los Klucko's"". This joint was Kluck's for over forty years. Forty years of frozen, overcooked, marginal seafood. Why go there? We didn't. So when ""El Klucko's"" opened we went with another couple and figured ""well, how bad could it be?""  One thing is: it's CHEAP. So they will draw the alternative types from the area. They slapped on the usual red, white and green paint and opened the doors within a week of Kluck's closing. At least you get to sit down and get served for your $10.00. Salsa: standard. No salsa verde. I asked the waitress (in Spanish) for salsa verde and she brought another salsa roja. Oh, well. The chips were warmed but not, as far as we could tell, made on the premises. I asked the waiter if I could get a chile relleno without the beans and rice. He said ""well, it's only another two dollars for the beans and rice"". He was kind of arguing with me! So I caved in. What came was the usual plate of slop. Chile relleno BURIED in bland rice, bland beans, and tons of tasteless cheese. I really can't stand that kind of Mexican food. It isn't even Mexican. It's Am-Mex. More cheese, more better? Isn't that the American way? Bland, stringy, tasteless, a mass of melted post-atomic-bomb hole-filler. 
I really don't need that particular hole filled up in that way. Margarita report: among four people we had three pitchers of sour-mix Margaritas. We didn't even feel as though we had anything to drink. Stick with beer, I guess. At least you know what's in there. Service was perfunctory. Food was not so good. Drinks were weak. Crowd all looked a little rough around the edges and perhaps unbathed. Music was obtrusive.  UPDATE: Well, we DID go again.  Guacamole was okay this time. Enchiladas and tamales were edible. Rice: still bland. The ranchero style beans: all right. I would still steer clear of the margaritas. NO LIQUOR in there at all. Last time we took a flask of tequila and added our own (is that legal?), but beer is the best bet. The margarita is pure Lemix. They do not have wine by the bottle. Chorizo and eggs are edible. They don't seem to mind how long you stay, which is a plus. People watching is GREAT. Some serious characters with insane hairdos. Very John Waters. We keep waiting for Divine to waddle in with some kind of sequined poncho on. The fake Mexican accents on some of the waiters can get rather old. ""Hola Amigos!"" from a guy with hipster glasses and a fauxhawk? Still, it IS pretty cheap. And the portions are humongous. ANOTHER UPDATE: well, we went AGAIN. We won't be going any more. There was a bone in my husband's bean burrito. This would have been a real buzz kill for a vegetarian. I also ordered the ranchero beans again and this time it was almost all water, floppy cheap bacon,  and a few beans. Eggs with chorizo were hard as  rocks, but with chorizo. Salsa tastes different every time. Guacamole is definitely from Sam's Club. Don't torture yourself with this place. I have been to Mexico many times, and lived in California with great Mexican food all over the place. This ain't authentico. It is very uneven. I really want to like it, because it's so close to home, but after that bone in the bean burrito, it is finito.",0
tNJgmbODR-N0qdPGy4Vsrw,"Come on people. You know what to expect when you head out to a Mexican place that is located in an old seafood joint. That is exactly what you get. I leave satisfied. Plus, they serve Dr. Pepper.

I think the lower stars are due to the fact that some people might be expecting a bit trendier or authentic experience since the place is technically in Cleveland, and I agree it is a bit more of an outer-ring suburban Mexican dining experience, but it is decent for what it is. 

Although, I do remember being asked to leave because I was talking to my friend at another table. In fact, the waiter walked over to me and made a sweeping motion and said ""Shoo shoo. Your friends are done. You must go."" He was not joking either.",0
tNJgmbODR-N0qdPGy4Vsrw,"Sit down. 

Let me share a little story about how much good service really does end up making your dinning experience. 

My boyfriend, his son and I pull up to a parking lot full on a Friday evening. We finally find a spot and walk into the packed restaurant knowing that our huge party we're meeting isn't going to be there for another 45 minutes. In the service world, this translates to a small party taking up a big table on a busy night (aka, a waste of money.)

But we were not treated this way. Oh no. We were treated wonderfully. Never bothered, not even once, while they waited and watched the three of us sit at a nearly empty table of eight. Can you believe that? They even got us a towel when the little one's drink spilled a bit from the BeyBlades being played on the table. 

Yea, we were that annoying group in the restaurant. Deal with it.

When our party did show up, they came with three extra people we had to accommodate. And believe it or not, there was nothing but smiles from the staff. You'd think they were actually happy to have us (I think there were!) Then they served us all on separate checks and got our food out unbelievably fast. And the food was delish! No, it wasn't gourmet by any means. And no, it wasn't 100% authentic. But it was damn good and comforting.  

Just when you thought that was enough, they secretly pulled out all the stops and showed the birthday boy of our group a great time. They brought out a flashy sombrero, a shot of tequila and sang a great bday song to embarrass the crap out of him--and at no extra charge. 

Seriously, I've hardly ever had better service than how these folks treated our (probably) annoying party. And the food is very good. You can't beat both fabulous service and grub.",1
tNJgmbODR-N0qdPGy4Vsrw,"Warning: This might be the most pretentious review I've ever written, as it sounds like I think I'm awesomely cool for having lived in LA. Honestly, that couldn't be farther from the actual truth, as I'm pretty damned aware of my own absolute lack of cool. And having lived in LA certainly doesn't qualify one for extra cool points. (I think Cleveland is cooler anyway. See? I am so not cool.) But having lived in a city where Mexican food is a way of life... well, it's relevant to qualifying my review. So keep that in mind before you read on, k? Thanks. 

I lived in Los Angeles for a few years before I moved to Cleveland. One of the few (very few) things that I actually miss about living in LA is the Mexican food. It's not that there's more ""authentic"" food there. (Side note: That's always a kind of dubious claim anyway. When anyone claims to have authentic Mexican food - as El Jalapeno's does in big red letters on the side of the garish orange building - I always wonder ""authentic to what area of Mexico?"" It's a large country. There are quite a few different variations of cuisine that are ""authentic"" to Mexico. But I digress.) 

It's that there are just so many Mexican joints in LA - of various levels of quality and taste - that you really don't have to look hard to find a favorite Mexican place. Or a couple of favorites, or a half dozen favorites. 

Here in NEO, I've had a much harder time finding those favorites. It took a long time to find one, much less a few. When I first moved here 10 years ago, I solicited recommendations from the natives, though I gave that up after a couple of years of routinely being disappointed by places that I'd been promised were ""The Best Mexican in Cleveland."" In the last few years there have been a few that have managed to be marked in my head as favorites... though sometimes I wonder if it's just because I've not been back to LA in 10 years to Mexico City or Paco's Tacos or that little place on Hollywood Blvd with the awesome mole, and I've forgotten... Eh, either way, I've got a few go tos for Mexican now. El J is the closest one to where I live, so I end up there semi-regularly.

Is El Jalapeno's the best? Nah, I don't really think it's the best, though I still don't think I've had traditional Mexican here that I'd even want to classify as the best. But it's solidly tasty and inexpensive Mexican food, served SUPER FAST by (usually) friendly folks (The service can be hit or miss. I've had servers there that were cheerful and awesome, and I've had servers that clearly would like to throw a margarita in my face. So your mileage may vary on that end.) and the atmosphere and decor are pretty standard fare for your average Mexican joint with some TVs thrown in for extra distraction. Not super classy by any stretch, but not a total dive either. 

The fajitas are yummy and enough for 2 meals easily, the chimichangas have been decent, and a fellow former LA resident swears by the steak tacos (I think it's the al pastor variety that he digs the most) and that is all he ever orders when we go there. I have this weird craving for the ""Steak a la Mexicana"" (a thin ribeye with tomatoes, onions, and jalapenos) every so often - it's not a great steak by any standard, and don't even bother asking to have it cooked anything less than well done, because that's what you're going to get, but strangely, I dig it. (I'm usually a snob about steaks being at LEAST pink inside. But in this case... I dunno. The veggie combo just works with the well done meat I guess.) The only food bit I'd advise away from is the guac - tried it a couple of times and just found it bland... skip that and go for the greasy (and I mean that in a good way) fundido instead. 

This isn't foodie fancy Mexican, but satisfies a craving for Mexican comfort food whenever I need it.",0
tNJgmbODR-N0qdPGy4Vsrw,"El JalapeÁE±o's is pretty standard Americanized Mexican food, with a few specials that stand out.  It is prepared well, and the staff are always friendly.  
My personal favorite meal is the Cazuelada - Steak, chicken, and chorizo sautÁE©ed with red bell pepper, mushrooms and onions, covered with cheese. Served with Mexican rice and charro beans, it is the one thing I keep coming back for, even though it's a bit more expensive than the majority of the meals at $16.50.
If you're looking for authentic Mexican food, this isn't the place, but it is good and reasonably priced and worth the try... Hit up that Cazuelada and I'm sure you'll be pleased!",1
tNJgmbODR-N0qdPGy4Vsrw,"I tried coming here on Cinco de Mayo and found myself trapped in a snake of cars entering/leaving the overly packed parking lot. My first El Jalapeno's experience would need to wait. I came back a few weeks later with my roommate and the place was practically empty. The restaurant has an authentic Mexican feel to it. I sat at the bar, which had this giant glass shotgun glass bottle full of tequila above it. I wanted to ask the story behind it, but unfortunately the staff do not speak the greatest English. They were still attentive and able to get my order right though.

I ordered the chile relleno, refried beans and rice. The food came out super fast and was a gigantically overwhelming serving. I was determined to finish it all and definitely struggled to move for the next few hours. The menu is expansive and they definitely have every kind of Mexican dish you could want. I recommend going with on of the lunch specials - they charge $1 extra when rodering at dinner, which is kind of strange, but it's still the best deal available. I washed down the delicious Mexican food with a house margarita - which was okay, a little too sweet for my tastes. Definitely a solid place to grab some quick, authentic, cheap Mexican grub.",0

The ambiance was a super authentic Mexican vibe with fun lights, great decor and robust colors. The air was filled with the sweet sweet smell of steaming meats and veggies, ayyyeeee - sizzling fajitas! 

The first thing (naturally) that caught my eye as I entered was the Specials board where a 42 oz. Margarita was proudly displayed. $11.99 you say? Was there eve""uch a bargain more worthy of my time? The answer is no, my amigos & amigas!

tNJgmbODR-N0qdPGy4Vsrw,"While this may be a family friendly place, the blandness of the food leaves a lot to be desired. I gave this place three opportunities and was disappointed at every turn. 

The salsa tastes like tomato juice with an accident of garlic powder and black pepper. We ordered the sincronazada, a staple of Mexican cantinas, and was shocked to get a slice of Isaly's chip-chopped ham, some low-quality cheese and a tortilla. It didn't have the good chihuahua cheese or smoky ham that it should have had. That was a notable disappointment. Again the rest of the food was bland and not worth mentioning. 

This is a total skip-- not worth the time at all. Drive an extra couple miles and head to Villa y Zapata and get their Chile Rellenos, which are bar none the best in the region, or go to Luchitas. If you don't care about authentic flavours, head down to Barrio or El Carnicero for some quality!",0

Our food was as good as you can get in Cleveland - I found their mole to be excellent (more sweet than salty), especially with the addition of their spicy sauce. The only thing lacking was the salsa as it had pretty much no heat or kick to it. 

The service was also good. We did have to flag the server down for anything after we got our food but honestly that didn't bother us - my wife joked it was part of the authentic experience since that's what she's used to in Mexico!",1

It's the best Italian eats that I've ever had (outside of a family members' kitchen and authentic food while visiting the homeland.)  It's a must-visit spot before any Tribe or Cavs game - much better than paying for overpriced food inside the stadium.  It's cheap and delicious - you can eat and drink for less than $10.  It's a little crowded inside, but it's worth it.  The stromboli, calzones and sausage and pepper sandwich are my faves.  The owners are super-friendly and if you frequent Alesci's enough (like my family did during the Indians '94-'99 heyday) you'll get on a first name basis really fast.",1

Unlike every other bowling alley I've been too. It also doesn't have that musty bowling alley smell either which is a win in my book. If you want authentic Cleveland bowling, then maybe not, stick with Freeway lanes or Cloverleaf. 

By the way, our lane messed up with pins a few times and each time they responded quickly and fixed it. Then, when we left, they didn't charge us for the bowling, only the shoe rental to apologize. Now that is how you gain a customer. I don't see any reason to go anywhere else to bowl with my family ever again. I will be back.",1

I was disappointed that I wasn't about to dine on my favorite rice n beans, but when we arrived at La Tortilla, we were promptly greeted and seated.  We all ordered different dishes to sample the menu.  I ordered the least risque dish for my daughter - a sandwich.  But this wasn't just any sandwich, it was an authentic Cubano.  After my daughter didn't eat much of it, I decided to give it a try.  Wow!  My search for a great Cubano sandwich in Cleveland has finally ended, after two years!  I had to share the rest of the sandwich with my wife and friends.  Hey, my daughter wasn't going to eat it!  

All of our meals were amazingly good and I have since made trips to La Tortilla just for the excellent, excellent Cubano sandwich.  The mixed drinks were delicious too.

My favorite part about this place is how busy it was, ironically. You can tell it has been, and is still, a local hotspot on that perfect summer night after a game or family event. Be patient folks, the wait is meant to make your mouth savor to make that first bite unforgettable.",1

After checking out some of the local restaurants on Yelp, I settled on an Athenian (or Greek-inspired) Pizza from Athens Pizza.  After placing my order, I was sad when I realized that the large was only 12 inches in diameter.  That's usually a pretty small pizza for us to split.  However, when they delivered the pizza, it was definitely worth it.  The cheese was extremely thick and they didn't skimp on the other toppings either.  The gyro meat tasted authentic and the ""cucumber sauce"" was the perfect tzatziki compliment.  Extremely filling overall and left no one hungry.

tulUhFYMvBkYHsjmn30A9w,"There is a lot of buzz about this place, especially given its feature on the Food Network. Having lived in New Orleans for some time, I was both curious and eager to give HSW a try. (New Orleans is famous for some of its fried/comfort foods.)

The Bottom Line: this place is rather magical. If you love fried food that is slathered in hot sauce, then this is your place. To be honest, the fried food offers a one-dimensional taste experience; however, the food presentation is beautiful...in an ordered-chaos sort of way.

There's a menu, but you pretty much just get whatever they have available (I.e., whatever is sitting in the warmers behind the counter). I tried the fried chicken and the famous Polish Boy sandwich -- a fried kielbasa topped with coleslaw, fries, and hot sauce. I also ""sauced"" everything, allowing the kind worker to paint all of my food with the ever-so-sweet-tangy-and-delicious HSW hot sauce. The food was hot, and amazingly, the chicken was as crispy/tasty as some of the famous fried chicken of New Orleans' Willie Mae's Scotch House and Dooky Chase. (Huge success!)

The decor is the best part of HSW. The restaurant is appears to be a bit rundown, ostensibly dirty, and some of the windows are adorned with iron bars/mesh for safety purposes. While this may seem to be a negative, it is not. These details, coupled with the ambiance of the restaurant's neighborhood, offer the adventurous and hungry an authentic City of Cleveland dining experience.

I think Tea House noodles has an identity problem.  It's ""Asian"" in that it serves Asian-inspired food but not really committed to any particular region or cuisine.  I feel like it's food made for people who want to feel like they're eating something ethnic without actually committing to it.  Just dumping a bunch of traditionally Asian foods in broth doesn't make you authentic, it makes you kind of lazy.  Head to this place if you aren't picky but if you're jonesin' for an authentic taste to your meal, skip this joint and go somewhere else.",0
tWtuHpIFtQHMQq8q8DG3dA,"I picked this place because it was close to the Hyatt, where I was staying. The reviews were all really high so I was excited to go but was pretty let down. Maybe it's because I know what Asian food should taste like? It was generally healthy, which I liked but that is one of the few things I liked about it. 

*service: pretty good. I went later in the lunch hour but it was so busy. They got the food to me quickly which was good. They seemed haphazard but overall they were very nice. 
*pad thai: tasted nothing like real pad thai. It was a peanut sauce which was good, but not pad thai. The chicken was dry and bland. All together it tasted fine but I wouldn't order it again. 
*regulars: a lot of regulars were coming in, which was nice to see. This place seems like a staple in the area. 
*authenticity: not at all. I get what the word fusion means, but it wasn't fusion...and it wasn't Asian.

1. Location- A great little hideaway that makes you feel local for finding it.  Plenty of street parking and withing walking distance to most working downtown.

2. Price & Quantity- For under ten bucks you can eat anything off the menu. If you can finish a bowl and still be hungry......well I would be amazed.  Actually I would be suprised you could still fit through the door.

3. Tastiness- Its awesome.  If you looking for something authentic then keep on truckin.  This is Americanized asian food at its finest.  They put their spin on classics and make it their own.  Thumbs up for a creative spin on classic dishes.

4. Staff- Amazingly friendly.  If you look lost and confused when you get there......well they will walk you through the process to ensure you get to eat exactly what is on your mind.

GOOD STUFF:  If I was going to show someone a little italy type place, Valerio's would be it.  Small and crowded to the point of almost being smothering.  Always a table of old Italian guys sitting there having drinks and food.  Great food and the best Tiramisu I have ever had.  

BAD STUFF:  As above, small and crowded....buy hey, its LITTLE ITALY.  I wouldn't want it any other way.  Bar can get so crowded at times that it spills into the dining area.  Can be noisy as well.

PRICE:  about 80$ for two with bottle of wine.

THE UP-SIDE:  Everything an Italian restaurant should be!  Valerio's is small, quaint, and overflowing with an authentic Italian restaurant vibe.  The food is absolutely outstanding and the staff is incredibly nice.  To top it off, the prices are very reasonable for such an outstanding dining experience.  (Expect to pay about $75 for a dinner for two with wine.)  By far, the nicest, little restaurant in Cleveland's Little Italy.  

THE DOWN-SIDE:  The place is small, and that's part of the charm.  However, it's also VERY busy on weekends.  Thus, it's always a challenge getting seated at the exact time of your reservation.  Just relax, sit at the bar, and wait.  It's worth it!

THE SUM-IT-UP:  A small, bustling, wonderful little Italian restaurant that is not to be missed.  Don't go here expecting things to happen on a quick timeline.  Sit down, relax, soak up the atmosphere and enjoy some incredible Italian food - at a leisurely pace.

tXJkGjBkGOZHWAcCmlzS6w,"Last Sunday while in Cleveland on a visit we decided on Italian food for dinner and went to Valerio's on recommendation of a friend. The meal that we had was by far the best, authentic Italian food we have eaten in ages, probably since Italy. We shared a special antipasto of bresaola served over arugula with parmesan curls brightened by a squeeze of lemon: simple but perfect due to the quality of the ingredients and the perfectly balanced proportions. I ordered the osso buco served over creamy parmesan infused risotto cooked to perfection with a deeply flavored sauce bringing the whole dish together. The risotto had the right texture....creamy, moist but not soupy. My husband had the penne Bolognese, a traditional dish found in most Italian restaurants. But let me tell you that this was no ordinary Bolognese: in fact it was extraordinary with a complexity and blending of flavors that epitomize the wonder of true Italian cooking.  Accompanied by a good and generous glass of red wine the meal was sublime. The portions are very generous and left us room only for due espressi. 

The restaurant is welcoming and intimate and the waitress, daughter of Valerio, made us feel at home and comfortable throughout the evening. Valerio regularly visited the dining room to check on diners and to greet regulars sitting at the small bar. The atmosphere and fantastic food here makes you want to become part of the ""regulars"".

Well, she ordered the gnocchi and didn't like it, so I gave her my mushroom ravioli, which we both loved. The alfredo sauce over the gnocchi was delicious, but the flavor of the gnocchi itself was not that good. I'm sure it tasted liked it was supposed to, but I think I just don't like gnocchi. Maybe if the pieces were chopped up smaller, increasing the sauce to noodle ratio, I'd like it. The flavor of the noodle was kind of funky. I tried all the other dishes around the table and they were fantastic. I really like the food and the service here. Expect to drop some cash when visiting, however. Our meals with drinks and tip averaged $36 per person.

We were the only guests in the restaurant and the servers were very friendly. The home made bread was delicious as was the red wine.

tXJkGjBkGOZHWAcCmlzS6w,The night I went there was a big party happening at the next three table. and still I didnt think it was too loud. Maybe the other reviewers like it library quiet? anyway - thats my whole view on atmosphere. now to the real review - - the food here is delicious and authentic. No wolfgangpucky nonsense going on here. Just excellent Italian food. Even thier bread is delicious.,1
tXJkGjBkGOZHWAcCmlzS6w,"I was excited to eat jere because I love the area, never have a bad meal. 

Street parking so be prepared to valet, walk a little or feed a meter. I suggest taking one vehicle if possible. The area is more historical and super cute with lots of shops and restaurants so it lacks modern conveniences like parking. However it's not that bad! 

We made a reservation and due to the size and popularity I suggest taking that route. The staff was seeming all Italian which was cool. That authenticity greatly made up for other parts of the experience. The food was great. Lots of variety. It was very good nothing wrong I just wasn't blown away. I didn't care for my desert at all. 

I understand these are historical buildings and that makes things difficult. However given the prices and  how long it's been established I believe updates couldn't hurt. The dining area is small and a bit tight. 

I thought it was a bit odd...The owner sat at a table for a while at the end of the evening. He spoke to like one table. I just thought it was odd he didn't ask others how their food was. It's all the same to me but I could see that others were curious. Then he just sat there very strange.

Overall it's a decent meal. A more cozy, intimate environment.",0
tZpxk604kWWHsJKyirraZg,This place has the best dumplings.  Pure authentic.  The other food is great too.  Lived in San Fran and Chicago so have tasted much authentic foods.,1
tZpxk604kWWHsJKyirraZg,"Love this place! We went there as a group so we could try multiple kinds of dishes. My bf got the Shanghai fried noodles and I got the ""large meat noodle soup"" (å¤§èEEéE¢). The fried noodles is authentic with baby bok choi and pork. The large meat is indeed large hahaha but a bit too oily. We like the Xiao Long Bao, it has enough soup in them to be close to the authenticity. Please note it's not dumpling!! It is different species: the chef has to mix pock, potentially some bok choi, chicken soup, and the key ingredient, fresh meat aspic, so that this has soup in it to be so tasteful!!! Dumpling can never be that complicated so please cherish the chef's hard work lol!!! As we are from the southern part of China we are so glad this place is open and we will visit there very often!",1
tZpxk604kWWHsJKyirraZg,"Food is delicious!! I agree with the first reviewer, best spicy beef noodle soup!!! You can tell by the texture of the noodle, it is freshly made and not out of the frozen bag. Xiao long bao is authentic it can be, not frozen.  Looking forward to try more dishes here and highly recommend.",1
tZpxk604kWWHsJKyirraZg,"Xiao long bao is very tasty.  Quite a few authentic Shanghai dishes including fried bean curd, boiled chicken, and pork and veggie wonton - the wonton skin has the right texture.  Other dishes are pretty good as well.  This is the best Chinese restaurant in Cleveland in my opinion.",1
tZpxk604kWWHsJKyirraZg,"This place is excellent. I almost don't want to advertise to try and keep the traffic down, but I'm probably too late. They got it right simple, authentic, delicious dishes. We got the soup dumplings, stellar. The pork belly noodles, the broth was amazing, the noodles were fresh and had perfect texture.  The ribs were the best.  We'll be back",1
tZpxk604kWWHsJKyirraZg,"I haven't found a good place that serve some authentic Asian food until I went to this place. Best duck, awesome soup dumplings and there noodle dishes are very tasteful!",1
tZpxk604kWWHsJKyirraZg,"I've been to this restaurant three times and since I and my friends eat a lot and we love to try multiple dishes, we've nearly tasted EVERYTHING on the menu, and I swear to my friend that I'll NEVER visit this place again because NOTHING there was good.

The first time we ordered soup dumplings and noodles. By the time we were ordering, the owner of the restaurant was talking to a customer in a nearly cringy tone saying that ""Sorry I'm from Shanghai so we only have the authentic Shanghainese cuisine. You can leave right now ""BULLSHIT. Spicy noodles along with other Szechuan dishes and Chongqing dishes on the menu are NOT from Shanghai and she's just being rude to that poor old lady. The spicy noodles were super oily but overall not tasty or spicy at all. The beef noodles were super sweet and that's the weirdest noodles I've ever had. Beef noodles from Han Chinese Kabob are way better than this. 

Ok, when it comes to the soup dumplings I'll explain how this restaurant became the ""best restaurant in Cleveland that has soup dumplings"". In fact, this is the only restaurant in Cleveland that offers inauthentic soup dumplings so it automatically became the first place. If you really want to try out some really good soup dumplings, drive to Pittsburg and try ""Everyday Noodles"". Everything there is so much better even the female shop owner is much nicer. Soup dumplings here are stuck together, just the same as the frozen soup dumplings that roughly cost 3 dollars at the Chinese supermarket. The dough of the dumplings is completely wrong. 

During the second time we went there we found out that they added some new dishes, and we ordered all of them, hopefully finding something tasty. However, this restaurant disappointed us one more time. Overall they did not even cook the dishes... all the stuff are stored in the fridge and taken out directly even without being microwaved. The spicy duck neck was stored in a fridge and they just took it out of the fridge, put some spicy oil above and it tastes terrible. The sweet and sour rib looks brown...-ish, which is not exactly the way it should look like. It should be a hot dish but it's another poor dish stored in the fridge and then being put on the table by the staff. 

I did not give this restaurant a one star rating just because this is the only place in town to have soup dumplings.",0
tZpxk604kWWHsJKyirraZg,"This place was fantastic.  Just had a family dinner here tonight and we tried a bunch of items from the menu and everything was very good.  The soup dumplings, rice cakes and pan fried Shanghai noodles stood out as must tries.  Lots of native speakers here enjoying the authentic Shanghai cooking.  Decor is a bit underwhelming but does that matter if the food tastes this great? Bring your appetite, sense of adventure and don't expect anything fancy and you won't be disappointed.",1
tZpxk604kWWHsJKyirraZg,"One of the most authentic Chinese restaurants in greater Cleveland. Come for the soup dumplings, stay for the spicy beef noodle soup! Very reasonable price for a lot of flavorful food. (Warning- if you do not enjoy very spicy food, ask for the beef soup mild). Order the cool cucumbers with garlic for a perfect compliment to the hot soup.",1
tZpxk604kWWHsJKyirraZg,"My husband and I went to LJ Shanghai last night for the first time. We love xiaolongbao, and was excited to find it in Cleveland. They are delicate little things, and the soup inside was tremendous. The eggrolls are by far the freshest we've ever tried, and the flavor pops in your mouth from the shrimp. It's nice to have an authentic Shanghai restaurant in town!",1
tZpxk604kWWHsJKyirraZg,"Absolutely love the soup dumplings here. I don't even know how to describe how good they are, that's how good they are! I also got soup while there and I'll just say, it might not be for the faint of heart. I noticed about a couple dozen beady eyes looking back at me in my soup and they were brine shrimp! I honestly didn't notice it while eating the soup, it was just unexpected! I also got the feeling that this place was really authentic so I trusted their choice of adding brine shrimp!",1
tZpxk604kWWHsJKyirraZg,Get the soup dumplings...so amazing! This is a small authentic restaurant...great service. Everything was tasty.,1
tZpxk604kWWHsJKyirraZg,"This restaurant deserves beyond 5 stars. The food here is unearthly and is packed full of flavor and deliciousness. The juicy soup dumplings and the spicy beef noodle soup were amazing and had me and my family on cloud 9.The service was impeccable and the owner was so sweet and welcoming. The tea was spot on and refilled readily. Don't ask for sugar because there is non in the building, remember this is Shanghainese not Mcdonalds. LJ Shanghai has traditional Shanghainese dishes and it is the perfect place for a hearty and adventurous dinner. Do not go in here expecting general tso's or lo mein because what they have to offer here is a thousand times better. If you're not going to respect the way the chef cooks, pay your tab and keep it movin. This place offers a unique experience and if you aren't willing to be open to something that hasn't been americanized then don't come here to complain, you uncultured swine. She orders everything straight from China so your food can't get anymore authentic than that, in my opinion. Give it a try and Im sure youll thank yourself you did.",1
tZpxk604kWWHsJKyirraZg,"Soup dumplings are pretty good.  Also had the pickled cucumbers,  pork with pickled vegetable soup, pork belly noodle soup, and the stir fry pork and noodles.  All were pretty authentic and tasty.  Just a tad bit on the salty side.",1
tZpxk604kWWHsJKyirraZg,"The soup dumplings are yummy and authentic, not quite as good as Ding Tai Fung, but only because of the skins.  Everything else on the menu was underwhelming in flavor.  The spicy noodle soup at least had good ma la heat, but was lacking in depth of flavor.  The beef itself was done very well, succulent and fork tender, and the noodles had a nice chew to them.  I had wanted to try the shanghai style salmon, but they didn't have any that day.  The rest of the noodle dishes, including the rice cakes, were flat in flavor and quite disappointing.  I'd say go early to avoid the wait on the weekend and just get a few orders of dumplings, then go over to Li Wah for dim sum!",0
tZpxk604kWWHsJKyirraZg,"This restaurant is amazing!! My friends and I met in Shanghai and wanted to get some authentic food locally. Needless to say, we made the right choice! The food was so good and the service was great as well. It was storming out and the power went out and they brought out miniature lights for each table and kept apologizing (no need)! We even saw them taking customers to their car with an umbrella. Y'all come out and get you some of this!",1
tZpxk604kWWHsJKyirraZg,"Reasonably price authentic chines food. My son suggested dumpling pot box for appetizer Was really good
Also tried spiced cucumber slices as appetizer 
Also good
 For meal I got pork noodle bowl , with pork, cabbage, noodles and broth. $10

Very filling and healthy
I believe it is a BYOB PLACE As we brought beer from Noble Beast Brewing",1
tZpxk604kWWHsJKyirraZg,"I should start by saying I have really high standard for Chinese food. That said, I would say the food here is more of a 3.5... tasty, vaguely authentic, but not mind blowing. I bumped it up to 4 stars because the waitstaff is SO nice and service is super fast. There's free 1 hour street parking right outside the restaurant! For Cleveland, it's pretty good and I've yet to find better. 

If you don't know what to order, I would start with the soup dumplings. Definitely read the instruction manual if you're confused how to eat it because the insides are hot! I had the spicy beef noodle soup. I thought it was decently spicy, however I wish it was more of a flavorful spice instead of just being loaded with chili oil. The beef was the best part and melted in your mouth. The veggies used was cabbage instead of bok choi but that was fine. I really enjoyed the noodles as well as they were chewier and tasted fresh instead of boxed. All in all, I'll be back here to try more of their dishes!",1
tZpxk604kWWHsJKyirraZg,"My better half and I were visiting Cleveland for a recent vacation and stopped here for soup dumplings at the recommendation of a local friend to satisfy my craving. The Shanghai soup dumplings came out quickly and the restaurant itself felt ""authentic"" to me (i.e. it's no frills). 

The pan fried flat noodles were underwhelming and needed more veggies and meat. The garlic cucumbers were also a bland for my taste, but perhaps my expectations were too high.  If I were to return again I'd probably just order 3 orders of the soup dumplings because they were the star of the show. In my humble opinion this is a Yelp 3-star restaurant if compared to a NYC Shanghai soup dumpling restaurant, but 4 stars for Cleveland.",0
tZpxk604kWWHsJKyirraZg,"Since I discovered LJ shanghai a few months ago, I have made it my day off ritual to go there for lunch. The food has been consistently wonderful, as is the service! I can't imagine getting tastier, healthier, more authentic food anywhere.
Be warned, spicy means spicy! That said, my to go to dishes are the garlic cucumbers and the spicy noodle soup.",1
tZpxk604kWWHsJKyirraZg,"So I am used to NYC Chinatown Chinese food but I will also compare to the other Chinese food places I have been to in Cleveland. I think if I was craving authentic Chinese food, this is one of the better options in Cleveland. I absolutely love soup dumplings which they sell here and they are okay, but not amazing at all. The meal and soup are warm to hot, while I would expect them to be very hot. The skin for the soup dumplings is also quite thick, reminiscent of something in between a soup dumpling that sags when you pick it up because of the heat, delicacy, and lightness of the dumpling when you pick it up and an actual dumpling that returns its shape and form. We had also gotten a noodle soup that I thought was more salty than flavorful and a cold cucumber dish. This reminds me of home which I appreciate and can satisfy a craving, but it certainly has work to do. As for LJ's presence in Cleveland, it is certainly special and makes soup dumplings and other more authentic Chinese dishes, so not take-out food, which can be hard to come by in this city.",1
tZpxk604kWWHsJKyirraZg,"Great soup dumplings (Xiao long bao)! We got two orders of the xiao long bao, and order of the cucumbers and a spicy beef noodle soup. The xiao long baos were very authentic and tasty, very soupy/juicy. The cucumbers were pickled and  slightly spicy, very fresh, but cucumber skin was a little tough/thick. The spicy beef noodle soup was delicious, but the broth was on the oily side. The beef was tender and amazing and the noodles were very fresh (handmade?). It was a little too spicy for me. Overall, great food (and only place for xiao long bao in Cleveland probably haha).

Update: came again and tried the sweet and sour pork ribs, which was a miss. Pork Belly Noodle Soup was delicious. Xiao Long Baos still perfect.",1
tZpxk604kWWHsJKyirraZg,"I got the veggie noodles. Bamboo shoots, tofu skins, bok choy. They don't skimp on authentic vegetables. The broth was really good. The portion sizes are big. My daughter loved the wonton soup. I thought they were open until 11 but it was only 9:00 so we over stayed our welcome but they were still nice. We have an exchange student from Shanghai and she loves it too. She texted her friend who is studying in Australia and he was so jealous. This was our first visit. We will definitely go back.",1
tZpxk604kWWHsJKyirraZg,Very authentic and good food. I wish the dumping wrappers were thinner and there was fresh ginger in the sauce cups. Portions were nice and the other dishes were very nice. The cucumber salad was okay but I definitely recommend you pour the vinegar ginger combination over the cucumbers to amp up the flavor. Smoked fish was pretty okay too. Dumpling were definitely the highlight and they were pretty good overall.,1
tZpxk604kWWHsJKyirraZg,"This restaurant maybe the only ""shang hai"" restaurant in town, but i question it's cooking. We went for the Shanghai soup dumplings and we were severely disappointed. The sound were too thick and there was no soup inside... It seemed to have leaked out before reaching the table. Such a disappointing flavor as well... It was almost all ground parts and i bit a piece of bone. I would have said that they were using frozen ones, but all of the frozen ones that i had tasted better.
As for the atmosphere, it was unpleasant... There was a stench of something rotten covered in vinegar when we sat down... The staff were dressed in sweats and other inappropriate clothes... And they did not show up to ask about anything after taking our order - other than to collect empty dishes and try to take our menu, as i assume that they have a shortage of these due to their poor cuisine.
The menu items are not much like ones that you will see in Shanghai... No Chinese greens, no elaborate main dishes, and no pumpkin soup nor dumplings.
In general, i would recommend that you stick to Cantonese restaurants in Cleveland as the others are not terribly authentic nor tasty of those i have tried so far.",0
tZpxk604kWWHsJKyirraZg,"Yes yes yes! Come for the soup dumplings, stay for the soup dumplings, come back again for the soup dumplings! Only place I've found in Cleveland with these delicious xlb (plus they're reasonably priced)! 
The rest of their menu is just as delicious with authentic Shanghainese dishes at great prices - love this place, one of my favorite Chinese restaurants here!",1
tZpxk604kWWHsJKyirraZg,"Xiao long bao (soup dumpling) in Cleveland?! You betcha! I've had really authentic version in Shanghai and the west coast, and while these didn't reach those standards, they were still delicious and had a nice balance of flavors. 

I've been coming back (probably 5 times since they've opened) and they have not yet disappointed. Though certain dishes and flavors may not be suitable for/appeasing to certain palates, nothing is bland. There are regional differences and styles in asian cuisine, so to say a dish has to be a certain way is narrow minded. LJ's has become a great new option Cleveland and  thankful they're here",1
tZpxk604kWWHsJKyirraZg,"This is one of the best (not so hidden) jems of Cleveland. I work in the area so frequent LJ Shanghai often. Their soup dumplings are authentic and delicious - be sure you order your own because you won't want to share! I often get the pan fried noodles and the spicy beef noodle soup. If you order the soup be sure you like spice! It is hot and builds the more you eat. 

The tables are very close together so it's not a great place for intimate conversations, but the food is absolutely fabulous. I tell all my friends about this place!",1
tZpxk604kWWHsJKyirraZg,"One of the most authentic Chinese restaurants I've been to in Cleveland. The staff is super friendly, the prices are perfect for the quantity of food you get. The soup dumplings are a must get. I also got the spicy chaoshou, so so good (just make sure you have a glass of ice water next to you!) If you like spicy this dish is definitely for you! All in all everything was great and I'll be returning soon! Thanks Lj!",1
tZpxk604kWWHsJKyirraZg,"Whenever I come to the Cleveland area, I try to stop by here for a meal.  Good authentic Chinese food is hard to find in the area.
LJ Shanghai helps with authentic food.  The spicy beef noodle soup had generous braised beef pieces, nice spicy, oily broth, and garnished with coriander and garlic.  Flavor was satisfyingly hot and numbing!  The spare ribs are a bit too sweet for me, but flavorful nonetheless.
Service was friendly and prompt!  Will look to stop by again soon.",1
tZpxk604kWWHsJKyirraZg,"I've got two words, Soup Dumplings! They were authentic and amazing. The fried noodles were also delightful. The place isn't much to look at, but don't be deceived, the service is friendly and attentive. The prices are more than fair, (just a heads up, they give a discount if you pay cash). I am not a foodie, but I love food, and the food alone gets five stars.",1
tZpxk604kWWHsJKyirraZg,"Very tasty and authentic, it reminded me of restaurants I visited in China. While there aren't a huge number of vegetarian dishes there are plenty to make a meal. We ordered Shanghai fried tofu (very good spongy tofu in savory sauce), cucumbers with garlic (a little bland), edamame with wine (wine added a nice flavor; FYI these are served cold), and fried rice cake (very yummy! Prepared vegetarian upon request). Would definitely go back.",1
tZpxk604kWWHsJKyirraZg,"I'm from Shanghai and trust me, this is the best Shanghai/Chinese food in the PA-OH border region. Very authentic food plus great service.",1
tZpxk604kWWHsJKyirraZg,"My favorite place in Cleveland! The soup dumplings are to die for! Additional favorites are the dumplings in chili sauce, flat noodles (tastes and hot from what smells like a wok - full of flavor), and ribs. We ordered the cucumbers as an entree, it was very refreshing. It's definitely an authentic place - you can even watch them making the soup dumplings to order through the window!",1
tZpxk604kWWHsJKyirraZg,"This place serves very authentic Shang Hai cuisine. Everyone raves about the soup dumplings. Everything I've had here has been so delicious. Their noodles are always soft but firm, exactly right. I'm getting hungry just thinking about my next meal here.",1
tZpxk604kWWHsJKyirraZg,"Soup Dumplings! That is all you need to mess with at LJ Shanghai....oh and their Spicy Beef Noodle Soup.  I've tried the pig ears...which were ok, however they would've tasted way much better if they were crispy (they were served cold)-the sauce they were tossed in was spicy with lots of cilantro.  I tried some of the other noodle dishes and Filo soup, but it was too bland for my tastebuds. Might be better for people who are just trying authentic Asian food for the first time.",0
tZpxk604kWWHsJKyirraZg,"I had been travelling to a lot places to try soup dumpling. I specifically stop this place to try their soup dumpling. I would say this is legit good. Very authentic. It is almost same to those dumpling I try in China and Taiwan. 

Love the noodles and wanton too. Very homemade dishes. Very cozy restaurant. 

Heads up,  the restaurant will be closed from. June 3 till July as the owner is travelling. So go grab it today!",1
tZpxk604kWWHsJKyirraZg,"Love this place! Not a lot of Shanghainese food in Cleveland so this place was able to fill the need with their authentic Xiao Long Bao and noodles. I especially love the Hong You Chao Shou (ç´Eæ²¹æEEæEE), although I think it's actually a Sichuan dish (but it's nice to have a variety).
I'll be back soon!",1
tZpxk604kWWHsJKyirraZg,"LJ Shanghai is a great addition to Asiatown in Cleveland. They serve authentic northern Chinese/Shanghainese cuisine. Most customers come here to try their delicious soup dumplings (xiao long bao). For those of you who've never had soup dumplings, they are kind of like purse-shaped wontons, but are filled in such a way that part of the filling will liquify during steaming. This creates a dumpling which has a bit of meat broth or soup inside. When you take a bite you get this explosion of soup as well as the dumpling filling and the thin wrapper.  I have had soup dumplings at many restaurants around the United States and I have to say these are pretty good. You get six dumplings for five dollars and they are brought to your table to order steaming hot. 

Today I ordered their spicy beef noodle soup. It has hearty pieces of very tender flank and tendon which nearly fall apart when you handle them with your chopsticks. The broth is a rich chili red, full of red pepper flake and Szechuan peppercorns giving the bra off a delicious peppery and a mouth numbing feeling. The noodles have a wonderful chew and mouth feel. This generous bowl of noodle soup was only $10.  I thought it also would be a good idea to have something to cool my palate eating all the spicy food. I also ordered a cucumber with garlic dish which is a nice cold cucumber salad. The cucumber has been dressed 
with sesame oil, garlic and a bit of salt.  This salad serves to cool and cleanse the palate between bites of hot spicy food.

The menu lists about two dozen offerings of noodle soups, noodle dishes, rice dishes, chicken, and other offerings.  I can't wait to eat my way through this menu.

Unlike some other Yelpers, I did not have any negative experiences with the waitstaff or my order. The food was served very quickly and my server made sure to refill my water several times without my asking. I struck up a nice conversation with the owner as I left. I think this restaurant has been working on improving it's customer service. I definitely will back and will bring friends/family.",1
tZpxk604kWWHsJKyirraZg,"My family really enjoys coming here for its soup dumplings (xiaolongbao) and its Chongqing spicy beef noodle soup. LJ Shanghai is located in the Asiatown area and is a small-ish space, serving authentic Shanghainese plates as well as some other regional dishes. Prices are within the $5-10 range, and certain menu items are more hit or miss in terms of quantity for price. In the past, I have ordered their cucumber side dish for around $6 which was not worth the sticker price, but the soup dumplings are pretty fair at $5 for a rack of 6. The soup dumplings taste really soup and have a lot of broth inside. LJ Shanghai is also well known for its beef noodle soup, which is a large $10 bowl of beef and noodles in a spicy oily broth. The noodles taste great (really supple and flavored) and the soup comes with about 3-4 large chunks of tender braised beef as well. 

Additionally, today we got a bowl of shrimp and pork wonton soup and a special of stir-fried beef chow fun (except not rice noodles which is typically used but rather the same type of hand cut noodles that they use for the beef noodle soup, but thicker). Both were reually good and decenty large portion sizes. We thought the wontons were really yummy and the broth really great as well.",1
tZpxk604kWWHsJKyirraZg,"Solid and affordable place for some shanghainese cuisine. Soup dumplings were pretty authentic, as well as the Shanghai meatball. The popular chongqing beef noodle soup was decent, but being from California where I've had many an amazing beef noodle soup, it definitely lacked that depth of flavor that I'm really looking for in a good soup. The chili oil flavor is pretty tasty at first, but can get a little overpowering as you finish the noodles. Would revisit to try their other small dishes and non-spicy noodle soups.",1
tZpxk604kWWHsJKyirraZg,Our family always enjoys the amazing soup dumplings here. All of the other dishes we have sampled has been awesome as well! Definitely a place to go for great food and trying to explore some authentic cultural cuisine!,1
tZpxk604kWWHsJKyirraZg,"Super authentic, def get the soup dumplings. If you don't know how to eat them ask so you don't burn yourself!

They have really great noodle dishes and the portions are huge. Good service and an open kitchen so you can see them making the dumplings!",1
tZpxk604kWWHsJKyirraZg,What an amazing little find. This place has amazingly authentic Chinese dishes. It's a great addition to the Cleveland Asian food scene. The fresh cut noodles has amazing flavors. Only thing preventing the restaurant from getting 5 stars was the attitude one of the female workers. I don't know if she owns the restaurant or what but she sure acted like she owns the whole city. Yelling across the room and telling me to sit down was kind of rude. I just wanted to ask about bubble tea. There is no excuse for poor attitude. Thanks for preventing me from getting bubble tea.,1
u1qzJu0JwbKU-HjIFjq8kw,"The quality of the espresso drinks is head and shoulders above the Starbucks, Caribou and Arabica chains, but the new Phoenix location is giving Dewey's a run for their money. The location can't be beat and you couldn't ask for a better cafe atmosphere.  This is truly a place where you can spend a few hours...easily!  This is a real coffeehouse.  It's authentic.  It's local.  It's clean.  It's cozy.  The service is great.  It's delicious.

The espresso drinks aren't on par with artisinal coffee houses like Gimme! (Ithaca) and Intelligentsia (Chicago), but they are good.",1
uBGPTzye3wrxZPf54AXuFg,"First, the location is attractive and the dining room is very nice. It offers a clean, modern look, but remains warm and comfortable. The summer is nice because their many windows allows natural light to shine in. Also, they have an excellent patio.

Sadly, location and ambience are the only positive things I can offer in this review. The food was mediocre and in some cases, just not tasty. The menu lists items that sound authentic and delicious, but most things we ate were pedestrian at best. Their blue corn chips were nice. Thin, crispy, and warm. They were a nice vehicle for their guacamole. We ordered the Guacamole trio and the plain tasted the best, but was under seasoned. Forgo the specialty ones. Their Queso Fundido was hot and cheesy, but again, under seasoned. The jalapeÁE±o garnish gave it some flavor.

Folks in our group tried the Coca-Cola beef tacos, Cerdo Divertido Burrito, Carnitas, and Cuban Sandwich. All dishes were underwhelming. To varrying degrees, all the dishes were surprisingly dry. The beef in the tacos and the Carnitas were dry  and near chalky. The beef had decent flavor, but it's brittle, dry texture really ruined the dish. Carnitas are supposed to be very tender ""d unctuous. These were tough and dry. The burrito and Cuban sandwich are both breadier options and needed more condiments. They were under dressed.

Lastly, the price point for their food is way too high especially for the quality. ""School cafeteria"" and ""generic"" were terms we used to describe the food. The flavor in most of these dishes showed good effort and potential, but were just so poorly executed, in my opinion.

The server staff were generally attenti",0
uBGPTzye3wrxZPf54AXuFg,"Pros: the VIEW!!! The drinks, volleyball courts, decor, layout, wait staff, authentic and classic Mexican dishes with a modern twist.

Cons: bland food, the usual startup hiccups (slow service), bartenders that can't tell the difference between vodka and tequila, and parking (unless you're docking your boat right there).

All in all - we checked out Nuevo last Friday for a friend's birthday dinner. Walking up, it was packed, patio was full, and it just looked super inviting. We were seated immediately outside. If you're going to sit on the patio, ask for the upstairs... your view is going to be amazing. As I mentioned in the pros, the food was good for the most part. Nothing to write home about, but definitely wouldn't keep me from going. I do expect this menu to change quite a bit as they get their shit together, but it's not bad. We had the guac, queso fundido with chorizo, ceviche (a different, creamy type, with coconut milk I believe), the calamari, and the salsa trio as an appetizer, and all were pretty damn good. The entrees were nothing special though. I had the pollo crema and tried the tacos al pastor from a friend - they were okay. Nothing spectacular, but also nothing that would keep me from going back.

Drinks were amazing. We tried several of the Margaritas Flights... they come in 8 or so different flavors. You pick 3 and they're served on these cute little 1x5 boards and they're actually a decent size. They were amazing until the server brought out 2 margaritas on one of the Flights, and a full glass of Tito's vodka in the other. He explained that the bartending staff ran out of the margarita I wanted, so they gave me Tito's vodka instead. LOL! They didn't bother letting me know before they brought it out, though. The server expressed a little anger over the bartending staff. I asked to speak to the manager. Some guy came out, said he wasn't the actual manager, but an assistant. He was really nice and apologized, and they brought out a new margarita. For that view and ambiance, I'd go back any day!",1
udFcIcbWbxrO8uLF95WnQg,"Third time back at Cowell & Hubbard. This time I came with 7 other friends and tried a ton more dishes than the other 2 times. Highlights: mussels appetizer, lamb breast entree, lingini with squid sauce, and meringes desserts are my favorites! Anyways, here goes the full review of my 3rd meal here:

Appetizers:
Bone Marrow (3): sad. third time trying bone marrow ever, and I wish Bruell didn't cut the bone in half. It made it easier to grab the marrow out, but i feel like it lost the authenticity of it. In addition, the bone marrow wasn't as salty or as flavorful as the one I had back in Paris. But, on a good note, glad to know a restauratn in cleveland has bone marrow and there was a ton of meat/fat in it! :D 

Butternut Squash (4): got this a second time, and it had a lot more sauce than the first time we had it. also wasn't as delicious as we remembered, but still worth it!

Mussels (5): wow. the sauce that Chef Bruell adds in this mussels are just amazing!!!! 

Entrees:
Roasted Whole Chicken (4.5): WHOA! so tender and it sure was an entire chicken! This dish was so filling and the sides were perfect. The side (portabello mushroom and potatoes) came in this mini crockpot and it was so cute. either way, the chicken was great! And still just as good after microwaving

Risotto with shrimp (5): YUM YUM YUM. If you like big shrimps and risotto, get this! The risotto had a ton of flavors and it was very very delicious right the right texture. The shrimps were soooooooo good and they were like JUMBO SHRIMP! 

Giant Pork Shank (4): this pork shank wasn't as big as the first time I came here with a friend. Thoguth the first time, it was bigger. Regardless, the flavors were still there! WOOT WOOT! 

Chicken Livers (3): tasted like mini fried chicken tenders. Flavors were great but the dish was a bit bland.. it needed more pairings or flavors.",1
udFcIcbWbxrO8uLF95WnQg,"Two words: SALAD BINGE. Now, I know that may not be the sexiest combination of words that can be thrown at a restaurant, but before you go, ""ugg, let's scroll past this dieting freak"", hear me out. Cleveland, and the Midwest in general, is not known for being kind to green things you can't fry. Leafy things are normally served with a sneer out here, or served on the side of something meaty and manly as a wilting afterthought. But there is an upside to the redonkulously huge menu here, and that is a long list of interesting and different salads, plated in substantial portions and whisked out to you quickly. And the salads are darn good. So after sampling most of the menu and going, ""ehhh, hit or miss"", I've nestled into the welcoming bosom of their salad section. I occasionally come here when I need to remind myself leaves are edible again. 


As a bit of a sidebar, I have a bone to pick with Zack Bruell. Out of all the chefs who could conceivably brand themselves, Zack is a head-scratcher, because he seems to have no signature cooking style. Dude, get a style, ANY style, and stick to it. Please. Because your giant schizophrenic menus give me a headache and wonder what's the worth of a celebrity chef when there's no one signature flavor or dish. The menu at Cowell and Hubbard is the worst offender. Most Chinese takeout places would look at this menu and go, ""okay, you don't need to have a billion specials"". 

When I first was handed the menu here I assumed it was the wine list, because it was so long. And there's Asian dishes, French dishes, Italian dishes; you name it it's probably on there. The drawback to this is that meals lack consistency and never feel like something the chef is dying to cook, instead feel like dishes by paint-by-number, that also lack authenticity. I will commend the cooks, for how massive the tome you can order from, a large percentage of the food is darn tasty. But if I'm paying this much for food I want a point of view coming from the kitchen. Also, this generic-ness bubbles over into the design of the restaurant. While Cowell and Hubbard is a handsome large space, it feels a bit bland, like the interior of a wine bar in an airport terminal.  


So what's a gal to do with a menu that is so morbidly obese it needs a gastric bypass STAT? Well, take advantage of the fact that instead of one compulsory salad, this place has eight. I've shamelessly sidled up to the bar here and ordered five salads, and they come speeding out, to be stacked in front of me like green jewels. And the salads are everything you want in a salad: more than just leaves to substantiate the plate, zesty zippy dressings, perfect salting and or lemon juice pops, and large sizes to fill you up. 

Current menu offerings include the julienne apple, carrot and radish salad with blue cheese, creamy horseradish and walnuts ($9) (fresh, pretty and crunchy). There's a frisee and pork croquette salad with smoked paprika aioli ($9) (take on a classic French salad, porkis the star here and done well). Also there's a quinoa salad with arugula, peppers, squash and raspberry vinaigrette ($8) (a tad bit boring but very virtuous tasting). Also you can choose a beet salad with feta and white balsalmic ($11) (a classic for a reason). My two current favorites are the caramelized fennel and arugula salad with goat cheese, marconna almonds and raspberry vinaigrette ($10) and the artichoke salad with frisee, radicchio and caper berries ($10). There's even more salads, but I think you get the point. 

As for, you know, the rest of the menu, it can be hit and miss. I've had a braised rabbit pasta with homemade noodles that was tasty. I've also had fish that tasted old, and paired poorly with some sour cabbage slaw. I've had a dessert of a strawberry napoleon with caramelized pastry sheets, vanilla cream and balsamic glaze. While pretty to photograph, it was awkward to eat (the layers shattered and went everywhere when attacked with a fork). 

Why, ultimately, is this my salad joint? For Cleveland, this place gives you some of the most variety you can get in one place, ups the salad flavors to new and interesting heights, and whisks the salads out especially fast. As for a fine dining romantic meal, you can have far better elsewhere downtown, but Cowell and Hubbard is inoffensive.",0
ue7tVbfE3cRt14LELax2nw,"Excellent, perfect authentic Mexican food. Very reasonable prices ....clean place to eat.",1
ue7tVbfE3cRt14LELax2nw,Fantastic authentic Mexican food. I've been here several times and have never been disappointed. The Al Pastor (marinated pork) and Pescado (fish) tacos are my go to.,1
ue7tVbfE3cRt14LELax2nw,"THE restaurant in Cleveland that brings me back to the traditional Mexican food I grew up with in So Cal - the little family owned joints where the plates were full and the food was spicy and delicious, and nothing was ""trendy"". The ambiance here is informal, festive and inviting, with comfortable seating and atmosphere.

The food here is always great, authentic and sincere, and the service is superior.  The Margaritas are particularly good, and ample. Shredded beef tacos, chili rellenos, tacos al pastore, all fantastic.  The salsa is spiced for ""average Clevelanders"", but add a little habanero sauce to the basic salsa and you can get the heat you want.",1
ue7tVbfE3cRt14LELax2nw,"Great friendly restaurant with authentic Mexican food.
We are Taco Asada and they were excellent.",1
ue7tVbfE3cRt14LELax2nw,Definitely some of the most authentic Mexican food in Cleveland. Atmosphere is a little simple and there's no alcohol served but if you want a great meal then try this spot. The queso was delicious and their salsa fresh homemade flavor. Chips weren't (just out of the hot fryer) but they were good. The corn tortillas were amazing which made my tacos taste even better.,1
ue7tVbfE3cRt14LELax2nw,Great authentic Mexican food! Had the carne asada burrito and it was so gooooood! The chips and salsa were very tasty too! Guacamole was some of the best I e had in a while! I'd definitely go back!,1
ugGMhvYnjheG3rHKxK2-gQ,"Absolutly amazing!!! Litterally the best waffles I've ever had. They use authentic Belgium sugar pearls (which makes a huuggeee diffrence) and have an amazing variety of toppings. I recomend the nepolian with vookie butter icecream, yum!!",1
ugGMhvYnjheG3rHKxK2-gQ,"Great selection.  Great combinations of flavors.  Great service.  Great portions.  It's kind of tucked away, near a bank.  The last time I went though, my friend ordered something and they did not have certain ingredients.  She had to change her order.  She was very happy with what she got.  I read another review which criticized this place because the Belgium waffles are not authentic.  So?  I've been to Belgium and had waffles there.  There not the same, but that doesn't mean the waffles at Euro Wafle are not delicious still.  I'm from San Diego, CA.  I could say the same thing about the Mexican food in Cleveland...or I could just enjoy what Cleveland has to offer.",1

unDs06rQ8V-d8-EujSVe8A,"Looking for an romantic, authentic Italian date night spot that oozes with atmosphere? Gusto! 

Its small space really lends to that intimate feel you're looking for on a date, but the accordion music is what really puts the powdered sugar on the cannoli. The owner, Ricardo (at least I think he's the owner), strapped on this huge instrument and went table to table playing old Italian favorites. My beau and I softly joked that we should be slurping the same piece of spaghetti when he came up to our table. 

Now, it's rare that a night out for Italian eats isn't already an indulgence, but Gusto really makes it decadent. We're talking luscious cream and butter sauces, rich seafood pasta dishes and nothing you'd allow on a diet. But, man-oh-man does everything look beyond delicious. 

We ended up spliting a caprese salad, the puttanesca and some other luxurious dish with lobster. Although it was tasty, the salad was minuet--I mean so tiny it was almost not there. When our main dishes came out I was relieved to see that I wasn't expected to consume 6lbs of pasta, like many other Italian restaurants. The puttanesca was perfectly cooked, spicy and the perfect amount to fill me up. On the other hand, Jason was not impressed with the portions and left quite hungry. Maybe next time around we'll order our own salads. 

This is not your mom-n-pop, casual Italian eatery. If you're looking for a nice treat for a date night out, then this is right up your alley. It's a little more on the pricey side, but not so much that you'll break the bank. 

Oh, and remember that street parking can be a hassle over there. There is a lot that charges, but if you don't want to pay try the side streets.",1
UOOqfmHLIok1l3q3l32YCQ,"It's Greek To You is the underrated, hidden treasure of Tower City. Tower City gets a bad reputation when it comes to food, and I get it. Yes, the environment needs a face lift. But tucked away on top of one of the odd numbered floors sits It's Greek To You. Its authentically owned with plenty of seating and a damn good gyro. Seriously, so much bang for your buck and the meat is juicy and flavorful. They have a huge menu of traditional Greek fare - so the meat eaters and veg heads in your life can all find something.

I first discovered It's Greek To You as my hidden gem CIFF spot when I'm crunched to get quick-but-not-greasy food during my tight film breaks. Since then, I find myself randomly eating here from time-to-time if I'm in Tower City. I forget about it but then get excited when I remember it's there.

Literal definition of don't judge a book by its cover: delicious food, meh atmosphere. If you're in Tower City and need a bite, this is indisputably your best place. Grab food to-go or sit for a while to eat and don't worry about dressing fancy!",1
UoRSHohdGuzfrpydZ9j0Lg,"One of THE best Mexican places on the west side of Cleveland! Claire, Ashley, Jess, and Eddy provide the best service and most authentic Mexican food you'll find in Cleveland. Highly recommend trying. The margaritas are also worth your money.",1

I have also had, I can't remember the name, but it is a fried I believe enchilada? And it was puffy and delicious! They have their own recipe for margaritas! 5* on Shaker Square!",1
UoRSHohdGuzfrpydZ9j0Lg,"Luchita's offers very good Mexican food at reasonable prices -- and for Cleveland, that's saying a lot!  (I was spoiled by living in Chicago for 35 years prior, where there are plenty of authentic, gourmet Mexican restaurants.)  The ambiance is comfortable and real -- does TGIFriday's HAVE to set the standard for restaurant decor in Cleveland?  And the service was warm, attentive and homey, which added to the enjoyable dining experience we had at Luchita's.

The empanadas were delicious -- light and NON-greasy, with flavorful fillings.  Green salad ordinary/undistinguished.  Flautas crispy and good, not great.  Sopa Azteca was tasty, a step up from ordinary, but not outstanding.  I had Pozole de Puerco Estilo Michoacano as an entree and it did not disappoint -- a more authentic dish with an excellent array of flavors, also a very generous portion.  My friend had Filete al Chipotle and gave it a B+: meat a bit tough, but ancho pepper salsa made up for that.  We were stuffed but shared an average flan for dessert, and it was plenty large enough to serve two.

Very glad to say I could wash everything down with my all-time favorite brew, Negra Modelo -- yummmm!

Note: we learned that all four Luchita's locations are independently owned and operated (by various family members), so food is not necessarily identical or equally good everywhere.  The 117th St. location is alleged to be the most direct descendent of the founder of Luchita's.  Try it -- you're unlikely to be disappointed (speaking of which, we had previously gone to the nearby Mi Pueblo and had a universally BAD meal).",1
UoRSHohdGuzfrpydZ9j0Lg,"Nyaa....so so.   I bought carry-out.  Enchiladas and burritos.   The food lacks authenticity in the ingredients.  The chicken choice was chocked full of chicken meat, but a little dry and just tasted like a wrap with lots of chicken, no taste of ingredients that we've all grown to love in Mexican cuisine in other places like Chipotle.  Maybe the eat-in menu has better taste, but looking at the prices combined with the mediocrity of the carry-out food, it doesn't appeal to me.  Oh yeah as I was waiting at the bar to place my order, the order taker instructed to take the chips and salsa away from me stating that I didn't need it???  What's a Mexican place without chips and salsa???  An Italian restaurant??",0
UoRSHohdGuzfrpydZ9j0Lg,"I haven't been to Luchita's in years. I remember exactly why it's taken me so long to come back to this restaurant during my recent visit.

Luchita's is an authentic Mexican restaurant, you're not going to find any tex-mex dishes here. 

My boyfriend & his son both got the steak fajitas. They were skimpy on the steak that's for sure. Their were more peppers than anything. My boyfriend's daughter got the steak enchiladas & she didn't like it. The steak was too chewy. I got a steak burrito & I wasn't pleased with it. It was flavorless & the steak was very tough. 

The dinner wasn't cheap either yet, the food was pretty mediocre. The only thing I liked was the service & the chips & salsa.",0
UoRSHohdGuzfrpydZ9j0Lg,"Great little bar that serves Mexican food on the edge of the West town neighborhood. Menu is fairly extensive but nothing out of the ordinary. Our server was Fernando who was great and made our evening pleasurable. Margarita pitchers are 17.00 which get you about 5, 5 Oz glasses. Not a bad deal. Most of the menu is written in Spanish so be prepared to bring your Babelfish translator. Place is fairly clean. Chips and salsa portion is rather small. Hostess looks like she is 14, let a group behind us get seated ahead of us. There is no hostess stand. You simply have to find someone who looks like they work there. We sampled several items from the menu and we're pleased, although the tacos are fried not served soft as you might expect from a real authentic Mexican place. Again, it is a bar first and foremost.",0
UoRSHohdGuzfrpydZ9j0Lg,"I love me some good Mexican food. Being half Puerto Rican, I think my standards are pretty decent in this regard. I like some semblance of authenticity, but keep an open mind that things end up ""Americanized"" to make it more appealing to the masses. 

I tend to find that ""hole in the wall"" establishments are the best. This place is no exception. The neighborhood this divey restaurant is in is dicey at best. Definitely a little unnerving in the evening times. If you were to judge this place at ""face value"" you wouldn't go in. The building is not at all attractive and looks more like a corner bar from the outside. But, momma always told me not to judge a book by it's cover.

I bought a Groupon to this place and boy, am I glad I did. What a gem! The inside is huge. Honestly, you'd never guess it from just the outside view. Well, that and the fact they have like 10 parking spots. The parking sucks...just being honest. So, if you come here when it is busy, expect to park on the side street. But back to the inside....the decor in here is pretty cool. It is well maintained and is definitely clean. Clean is like number one for me when I review a restaurant. I do not care how good the food is, if it is dirty, you have lost me. Plenty of seating to accommodate large groups or just a simple one on one date. The menu is simple with the typical Mexican fare. Nothing crazy out of the ordinary. We came right at 3 and placed our to go order. Within 15 minutes we were on our way to Edgewater to enjoy our little picnic.

1) Chicken burrito ala carte: This burrito was definitely on the larger side but very very simple. Definitely a more traditional burrito. Lots of shredded chicken, a nice soft tortilla and plenty of yummy and bubbly cheese. Simple flavors that just plain work!

2) Chicken fajita dinner: I am a fajita-aholic. I love fajita....and this dish definitely didn't disappoint. Lots of yummy veggies, tender and juicy chicken and just the right amount of spices and flavor. The veggies were cooked perfectly too. Not all soggy and gross....just enough bite! The fajita dinner comes with pico, refried beans, guac and Spanish rice. I will break these down one by one:

a) The pico was super fresh and full of flavor. I could tell this stuff was hand done and I love the amount of cilantro they used. I could eat this stuff as a side on it's own. 
b) The refried beans have to be some of the best I have had. Again, simple yet effective flavors. They are cooked perfectly too. Nice and moist and not at all greasy. Topped with some yummy cheese that is broiled to a nice bubbly brown.
c) I absolutely loved the guac. I cannot say enough about the flavor of this stuff. It was perfect and definitely fresh. Another thing I could eat as a side on it's own!
d) Spanish rice is a hit or miss at most places. This place is a hit. Perfectly cooked (not soggy, not hard) and just the right about of flavor. Some places serve you bland and soggy rice. Not here. This stuff was right on point!

The bartender who took our order was extremely friendly and willing to accommodate my request for hot sauce put in a small container. Made the time pass by fast by talking with us and getting us some water. I will be back for sure!",1
UoRSHohdGuzfrpydZ9j0Lg,"I have been to Luchita's many many times and have recommended it any time Mexican food comes up.  The food is great, service is great and fresh made (not from a gun) margaritas are the best.  Always a good fun crowd on either side.  I strongly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys authentic Mexican food.  My personal favorite is the Burrito Mojado.  Enjoy!",1
UoRSHohdGuzfrpydZ9j0Lg,"Spot on authentic Mexican food.  Not the kind of place where you place your order and it comes out 8 minutes later.  I gotta agree w PW about taco Tuesdays and man those enchilada's are great on Weds.  My grandmother would take me here as she lived within walking distance so this place also takes me back to good memories.  The sign out front is an icon in this neighborhood.  They are closed Mondays.  If you like Mole' then you really will like theirs.  This place is as Cleveland as Sokolowski's and should be on everyones ""Cleveland places to eat"" list",1
UoRSHohdGuzfrpydZ9j0Lg,"I'm giving this a one star because this by far was the worse Mexican food I have ever eaten. When I think of Mexican food I think of rich and hardy tastes. This place served me burritos with only the meat inside of them and nothing else. When have you ever eaten a burrito without any lettuce, tomatoes, sauce or anything else other than just plain meat?!
By far the most boring and tasteless Mexican food I have ever been served at a restaurant - EVER!!!
I don't recommend this place at all, and if you're going to try and argue that it's authentic Mexican food, then I would say if it's authentic, then it's from the boring and tasteless side of Mexico. Save your money and go to McDonalds before you spend it here, it will actually have more taste than the food served here.",0

My experience was pretty bland. I just didn't feel like there was much seasoning to the food at all. It almost seemed like a fusion sorta of place and less authentic. It was eatable but fell short of my previous experiences.

I will give a brag to the margarita it was perfect.

-Their chicken tandoori is delicious, full of flavor.
-Palak Paneer (cheese cubes bathed in sautÁE©ed spinach)
-Their rice pudding!!!!!!! (I seriously sometimes go just to get their rice pudding! It is hidden away near the front with the other condiments)

But if you are there for lunch, you should really try a little bit of everything. I once even had goat meat at this place! Indian Flame is authentic for sure (confirmed by an indian friend of mine)

I pretty much always order the same thing at North Indian places- paneer tikka masala, rice, and garlic naan, and while Indian Flames service brings down its rating, the food has been consistently good. It's not completely authentic, but it still tastes great-- I love the thick, creamy, tomato based tikka masala and the garlic naan's have always been on point! It also doesn't hurt that the portions are huge and its always a meal and a half..
All in all, the food and sheer convenience of this place makes it worth going back for, but I'd recommend carry out if you have the option.",1
UQMQDq8yuxnyQyBIoKhzoQ,"Great North Indian food.  Seems like it is family run.  The food is very good.  It is a hole in the wall.  It remind you of a Punjabi Dhabha.  Pretty authentic.  We had Papri Chaat, Palak Paneer, Paneer Tikka Masal, Salted Lassi, Tomato Soup, and Plain Naan. 

I liked everything except for the Papri Chaat.  The Paneer Tikka Masala could have been a bit less sweet and less sour.  Outside of that, this is solid Indian Food.  

We recently moved to Cleveland and this will be our North Indian restaurant of choice compared to others.

Why not 5 stars?  Decor, cleanliness, and service.  Decor is sparse.  It is not as clean as you'd like (but its an Indian place).  They need more wait staff as it is pretty busy and only one person really takes your orders.  And this person forgot the Papri Chaat as our appetizer.",1

UQMQDq8yuxnyQyBIoKhzoQ,"The lunch buffet is your best bet.  Otherwise, each entree rather expensive.  Provided that you attend the lunch buffet, self control is imperative.  However, if this is unavoidable, be sure to wear trousers that are loose, although garments with an elastic waist band, such as sweat pants, would suffice.  Leggings are not really pants. 

I've been coming here for close to 6 years now and have recently introduced boyfriend to the mango lassis. They're not really authentic (according to my Indian friends - I don't really have any authority on this) but super good.",0
UQMQDq8yuxnyQyBIoKhzoQ,"I have been to Indian Flame several times, and the food is always delicious. The cook does a great job at making authentic Indian food at a reasonable price. The Chicken Tikka Masala is my favorite, with the Tikka Malai in a close 2nd place. I could eat this food until I die!

However, and unfortunately, I might actually die waiting for decent service at this place. Upon ordering our food, the woman (not the one who owns the place - she's great) literally yanks our menus from us without even acknowledging our choices. Then, the food often takes 30+ minutes to even come out. This past weekend, while waiting ages for our food, I asked her very politely for a mango lassi shake. She again neglected to even acknowledge me, but instead walked back to the kitchen, brashly pushed open the door, turned to the cook just enough so I could see her roll her eyes and say, ""add a lassi shake""... Then, when it came out 10 minutes later, it wasn't even a shake! It was just a normal mango lassi. 

I was blown away. I have *never* been treated so poorly at a restaurant - let alone a restaurant that I've been to many times. 

What is hard, though, is the food is still good. So, I'll probably return - but I'll call my order in ahead of time for pick up and go eat somewhere else.",0
UQMQDq8yuxnyQyBIoKhzoQ,"Really good food that is closer to authentic than most Indian restaurants. This place is a hole in the wall in the Cleveland Heights area, but it has an extensive menu with traditional North Indian staples as well as a good selection of Indian street food items, which are not always found at other restaurants. The dishes are slightly overpriced, but the taste and portion sizes make up for it. I had the chicken korma and chicken tikka masala, both which tasted fresh, distinctive, and had the right amount of spice.",1
UQMQDq8yuxnyQyBIoKhzoQ,"I love this place! It's great to finally  have a GOOD indian restaurant ON Case Western campus. 

The food is less expensive relative to other Indian restaurants of Cleveland because they give free naan or rice with each dish. The serving size of the chicken buryani is great too. I especially like their authentic bhel puri. Overall, I eat here pretty regularly.",1
UQMQDq8yuxnyQyBIoKhzoQ,"Great Indian food, and terrific service. Flavors are authentic and not overly Westernized. The location could be better. It's a block away from where everything hip and trendy is, and could use some work, but the food and service more than makes up for it.

The Bhel puri ordered spicy was delectable, and tasted like just off the street in Mumbai without the newsprint leaking into the chutney. The Aloo Gobi was just like my mothers, and the bharta tasted like it was cooked on a charcoal stove just like the old days. The staff is detail oriented, and very helpful, and happy to be creative. They made us a delicious limbu pani which wasn't on the menu.

Even our one year old thoroughly enjoys their food!",1
UQMQDq8yuxnyQyBIoKhzoQ,"It was my first time back since they moved to the new building. I loved the decor and ambiance. Service was exceptional and food was delicious. 
Their Papri Chaat is the best I have ever tasted. 
Malai Kofta is one of my fav dishes and it was excellent. 
They don't over use Masala (Indian spices) instead use perfect amount to give great flavor.
I always get Garlic Naan but tried Onion Kulcha also last night and now I'm hooked. 
It's great authentic food and portions are generous. 
Looking forward to going back here soon!!!!",1
UQMQDq8yuxnyQyBIoKhzoQ,"First time trying this place. I've had Indian food before but I guess it wasn't really as authentic as this place. The food was great, fresh and the place was nice. It's a little small inside but I sat at the bar. I tried the Indian beer and it was ice cold and refreshing. A lil pricey but if you want to try something out of the norm like I did, then I say this is a must try. The staff was nice too!",1
UQMQDq8yuxnyQyBIoKhzoQ,"They've recently remodeled! It's a great improvement; looks clean, the styling is great.

Lunch or dinner, Indian Flame is the go-to Indian restaurant if I crave in University Circle.

For lunch, they do buffet-style. Basmati rice and naan are always available at the bar, along with fried vegetable fritters and tandoori chicken. Vegetarian curries are plenty, about 3 choices each day. Meat curries range from 1-2 each day, most of the time being Tikka Masala or Butter chicken. Chutney available on the side. Service is great, people clear your plates regularly and pricing is excellent.

For dinner, they change to restaurant style. The portion sizes are big, and the selection of curry is fantastic. As a non-Indian person, it is hard for me to tell how authentic the curry is, but it certainly is delicious to my palate. I recommend getting naan with your meal, as well as a samosa. You'll be stuffed, so be prepared to ask for take-out of the leftovers.",1
uqPHO-o4stxGXLdxP3WNig,"It was a great experience visiting the Indian Bistro on mother's day !! The food was excellent and the service was commedable. The chef Mr.Jagan Mohan was very personable and presented flowers to my mom and mother in law for mother's day which totally spoke of a class. We will continue to be their regular patrons and I would highly recommend going to Dakshin Indian Bistro for experiencing good authentic indian cuisines !!

Ur4eYOFq4qVLHkZJNmcqfQ,"This place is a gem! Upon walking in you get the idea that it is nothing more than a dive bar and the notion of the name ""Prosperity Social Club"" alluding to buttoned-up bougie flies out the window. However, while priced dive bar-esque, the food and drinks are top notch. I recently attended on $12 steak night Thursday during Happy Hour so my house-made sangria was $4.50 - talk about a cheap date! The steak was good, and I mean that in an ""absolutely delicious for $12 but not Marble Room/Cleveland Chop/Blue Pointe Grille"" way. Seriously, for $12 you get a nice sized NY Strip steak and a heaping pile of perfectly seasoned shoestring fries. I also sprung for the $5 Happy Hour Potato Pancake appetizer, which comes with apple-cranberry chutney on top and a side of sour cream. YUM!! Reminds me of my German grandmother's cooking. While I was eating the server was asking a gentlemen next to me, who she knew by name, if he planned on coming to Friday's Fish Fry so that she could save a seat for him. At that moment was when I knew I was in a great place - the staff truly know their repeat customers and make sure they receive top-notch service. I can't wait to come back for $6 Burger Tuesday and also try the $6 Vegan Buffalo Wings with celery and vegan ranch - I am a carnivore and a wing snob through and through but this has my interest piqued!! Overall, a very pleasant dining experience in a place whose food, decor, and service reminds me of home.",1
USRXU4ASBAFSKhlk-KVrCw,"A l o n g time Cleveland institution. (Well over 30 years, likely much longer.) The owners have changed multiple times (numerous...) but the name stays the same. Their food is always passable, and the service varies. It's probably the best place to get dim sum, and more people are saying now their regular menu is better than other places in terms of portion size. The menu gears more and more American than authentic Chinese, but you can always ask if they have or will cook certain dishes.",1
USRXU4ASBAFSKhlk-KVrCw,"Disappointing little place, too many Americanized Chinese dishes
like sweet and sour chicken, general tso's chicken, lo mein etc.

 If you want to eat better Chinese food with fresh ingredients 
for better price with a friendly brighter atmosphere and cleaner

 Siam Cafe has a much better menu and you're more likely to 
find real authentic Chinese food (excluding the dumplings which
Bo Loong has better ones) everything at Siam Cafe is just better.",0

Dim-sum...I advise weekend only, go early and take an Asian person with you if you want to actually be served.  I speak from experience, having frequented the establishment with my (now ex) Filipino husband.
Rest of the menu....blah.  
New Wong's (now called wonton BBQ or something) will meet all your delicious Chinese food needs, and is more authentic!",1
USRXU4ASBAFSKhlk-KVrCw,"I was pretty impressed!  Not even taking into account that they're one of the few places in town that offers Dim Sum...

Ordered the Duck and Vegies as well as the Beef Chow Mein.  We went on Chinese New Year so I also ordered several potstickers and dumplings.  I guess my only complaint is that the dumplings were fried, but hey, they were still delicious!

Everything I had was flavorful, chock full of bok choy, meat, sprouts, all the good stuff!  Our service was also spot on.  Honestly, couldn't ask for more!  

I've also ordered catering from them, several times actually.  Every time it's been authentic (and I feel like I can say that because I work with several Cantonese coworkers and students), well sized for the price, delivered on time., and all that good stuff.  

In fact, earlier in the day I'd had some of their dumplings catered.  These weren't fried (not sure if I just didn't see them on the menu or if they were a special catering offering for the day)., but they were amazing!  

Overall, a big fan!",1
USRXU4ASBAFSKhlk-KVrCw,"My family loves visiting here. My kids love the dim sum and so do we. Sure, it's not the fanciest place, but it's authentic, right down to the staff who barely speaks English. You can't beat the prices for the quality of food. We like it.",1
USRXU4ASBAFSKhlk-KVrCw,Dim Sum at the Bo Loong Restaurant reminds me of growing up in Hong Kong. Going to dim sum over there was done multiple times a week!  Bo Loong is always excellent and always authentic from the friendliness of the ladies pushing the carts of dim sum around to the freshness of the food.,1
USRXU4ASBAFSKhlk-KVrCw,"Dropped by this place on a Tuesday for lunch. It is right across from Siam Cafe where I had lunch a couple weeks prior. I'd heard/read about both these places and decided I just needed to see for myself. 

It was about noon, and raining heavily outside, so I don't know if that had anything to do with the place being pretty slow. I'd say there were about 8-9 tables with guests, and a few of those were single diners like myself. 

The service was prompt, even though the waitress was a little hard to understand. I tried some of the shrimp dim sum, and then had the sheschuan shrimp, which came with soup and green tea. I thought everything I had was very tasty, and the portions were a good size. excellent value, considering my entire meal was a little more than $9. will be back again to try more menu items.

I think this place gets a bit of a bad wrap compared to Siam cafe across the street, but I'm not sure why. Maybe it's because Siam Cafe has big windows on three sides and appears much brighter in comparison to Bo Loong, which is definitely darker on the insde, mainly becuase of the lack of windows.

I thought the food was authentic, delicious, and a great value. Best for you to see for yourself.",1
USRXU4ASBAFSKhlk-KVrCw,"This is Cleveland's best place to order fresh/hot/tasty authentic Chinese dim sum

USRXU4ASBAFSKhlk-KVrCw,"bo loong has always been our go-to place for dimsum.

what we had (11/18/12) 

shumai

i'm starting with the shumai, which to me is one of the best i've had anywhere.

texture and taste are what set it apart.

it's not mushy like other shumais, it has a certain snap to it that i like.

dip in soy sauce with some chili oil and we're good to go.

fantastic balanced taste.

i don't know how else to describe shumai, it's just good.

we always get at least 2 orders of this.

since we're in a group of 7 people for lunch, we got to have 5 orders.

(9.5 / 10)

Har Gaw

not sure how you can go wrong with har gaw.

not the best i've had, but i also don't know where i had the best har gaw.

it's pretty hard to mess this up.

here it's still very good.

shrimp also has the ""snap"" that i also wanted in the shumai.

maybe the wrap is a little thick compared to other har gaws, but it still works for 
me.

you gotta have har gaw anyway when having dim sum, and it's no exception here.

(8 / 10)

pork, shrimp, and chive dumpling

ok, so this is pretty average.

not too good, but not bad either.

one of those ""we've got to have some variety since there's so many choices"" type of thing.

it's like an elongated shumai with chives, but it's still not shumai.

i know it's hard to skip on taking on other stuff when you have a cart filled with different dimsums.

so this is one of those fillers.

still not bad though, and you can't go wrong with the combination.

but nothing memorable.

(6 / 10).

Chiu Chow Pork

we were told that this is still chiu chow pork, though the wrapping is different from 
traditional chiu chow porks.

the traditional ones have a thicker wrap, similar to that of har gow.

this one is similar to the shrimp, pork, and chive dimsum, it retains the chives 
and pork, but also has peanuts on it.

nothing fancy, not bad, not good.

average.

(5 / 10). 

pan fried char siu bao

we had this for the first time.

it's char siu bao, which is pan fried.

really, really good.

char siu bao is char siu bao anyway.

with that soft, bready texture of the bun with savory pork filing.

but the pan fried aspect of this dish is what took it a notch higher.

the crisp texture of two sides of the bun made it even better.

to me this is a better version of the traditional char siu bao.

this also became a favorite at our table.

(9.5 / 10).

Shrimp Cheong Fun

like the har gaws, i don't think you can screw up with shrimp cheong funs.

unless you overcook the shrimp, make it mushy, and take out the snap.

or mess up with the noodle, and maybe overcook it also.

the sweetened soy sauce here is fairly consistent as it is everywhere.

this one is good, though once again doesn't wow.

that said always have this if available.

(8 /10). 

Steamed Octopus

octopus was perfectly cooked.

not my favorite type of preparation, but we saw it there, so we ordered it.
firm but not tough, also a nice break from all the pork and starch around.

(6.5 / 10). 

Spare Ribs with Black Bean Sauce

this is another staple of dimsum places.

to me the more bones there are, the more flavor.

some others probably prefer the meatier parts, thinking there's more quantity in the order.

but these ones, probably chopped in the rib area, work well.

very flavorful and tender.

(7 / 10).

steamed fish with black bean sauce

the fish was tender, blends well with the sauce.

highlight was the fish, and the sauce was right enough not to overpower the fish.

tilapia is what they used here. and like the octopus, was a good break from all the pork stuff.

we also always order this when available, they do this well over here.

(7.5 / 10). 

tofu skins with pork

this one is actually good.

the picture doesn't admittedly, but that was the only one of its kind left on the cart.

think of it as a deconstructed shumai with tofu skins.

first time we ordered this, as we always have the one with mushrooms, which will be described below.

but this was very good. the picture doesn't do it justice, but this is real good.

(8.5 / 10). 

we always had a take that the best dimsum places are not the nicest.

we even think it's the opposite - the nicer the place and ambiance, the worse or more accurately, the less authentic the dimsum is.

li wah may be a nicer place, but i think the dim sum there is very bland.

it's very clean though, and a lot of office workers eat there, which could also be an indication of how they tailor their food.

bo loong though is always packed on saturday and sunday lunch, filled with mostly asian families as they carry on what is the equivalent of a weekend brunch.
 
we enjoy the food and comfort of eating at bo loong.

we go there early, around 1130 to 12 to get some parking, sit, i stand when the dimsum cart arrives, pick dimsums, and eat.

best place in cleveland for dimsum.

USRXU4ASBAFSKhlk-KVrCw,"I visited Bo Loong while on the Asiatown Food Tour and was so surprised. This spot is so underrated, and in my opinion, a best kept secret.

All the foods we tried were delicious. I wish I still had the Asiatown Food Tour menu - but I was impressed. I especially loved the dumplings, which were perfectly juicy and satisfying. All the dishes had great presentation and they seemed to have a diverse menu for vegetarians and carnivores alike. 

I liked the vibe in Bo Loong. I also saw a stage and what I believed to be some karaoke equipment. The interior is huge, with a disco ball and countless opportunities for seating. I bet this place gets hoppin' sometimes with both authentic, delicious food and great entertainment. I can't wait to come back here on my own!",1
UXXAzmuz2olKSpte9eF4Vw,Great authentic Latin cuisine. So far I've had the enchiladas (best I've ever had) and the steak fajitas (with more meat than I could shake a stick at.)

What a great notion! At 9:00 on a Friday night we were seated right away and the place began to get busier. We ordered the Monchos Platter as an appetizer. I highly recomend sharing this huge delicious treat of beef, pork, chicken, and cheese nachos. After reading reviews, we decided to try the cubano, which was authentic as promised. The toasted bread really helped make the sandwich. I highly recomend this little gem.
We plan to come back soon.",1

uYl_QBtb7bXhu9sgb4kCrg,"I have to give this unpretentious tavern a hearty thumb's-up, and have enjoyed its many benefits over the past year.  This is the most recent addition to a trio of similarly-structured local establishments: ABC the Tavern on West 25th (Original), the XYZ Tavern in the Detroit-Shoreway Neighborhood, and now 'ABC II: Uptown', if you will.  

Why do I appreciate this place?  I love the 'dive bar' feel with a true 'inside' that harbors an excellent kitchen serving up affordable yet tasty fare.  This qualifies it as a true gastropub - and yet it never touts such a moniker.

The staff here is another bonus.  From manager-bartenders Trace and Nick to bartenders Jessica, Monset, Rob, Eric, Zach, and Miles - everyone is friendly and attentive.  Franco, Chris and Joe keep it real and authentic in terms of very affordable, high quality grub that goes far beyond the typical tavern. 

Case in point:  one can select from everything from Shark Sandwich to Pork Belly BLT to Lamb Quesadilla to the infamous Atomic Dog - one heck of hot dog stuffed with Jalapeno and stuffed with bacon - here at the ABC.  Franco's soups - from tomato bisque to gumbo to even a vegetarian Ethiopian are savory and part of the fun here is catching new specials posted on their chalkboard.  When a food order is ready you hear the splash of a drum cymbal hit - appropriately - with a drumstick.  This is another touch that has seemed to irk some Yelpers but I feel it is all part of the unique signature of ABC.

The beer selection here is impressive and for those who may complain about the occasional $8 entry - you have to appreciate the quality and rarity of some of these craft beers.  Key craft mainstays like Two Brothers, Dogfish Head, Rogue and Stone are all present in full force - and yet there is robust representation from local up-and-comers like Hoppin' Frog (Akron) as well.

The bar features two happy hours (4-7 and 10-12) on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday as well as an all-day (til 2 PM) happy hour on Wednesday and Sunday.  Finally there is a noon-to-9 happy hour on Friday and Saturday.  This enables a visitor to enjoy $3 cocktails and a select list of craft and other beers at a discount. Example - Two Brothers Outlaw for $3.50.  A nice gated patio has been a welcome recent addition.

Some are put off by the intentionally dim lighting at night, but I like it.  Little touches like the mini-bowling lane and old-fashioned jukebox (where you actually get three tracks for a buck) add to the unique feel and vibe of the place.",1
uYl_QBtb7bXhu9sgb4kCrg,"This was my first experience with a Cleveland bar, and it did not disappoint. I have been back countless times, and I will continue to go back. 

To start, ABC is in a great area, surrounded by Case Western housing, Chipotle, Mitchells, and a ton of other food places. (University Circle has apparently come a long, long way in the past couple years.) But the great part about it is ABC is good even without its neighbors. I'll drive across town just to go to ABC. Hell, I have a friend that does drive from the west side just to go to ABC!

One of the things I appreciate the most is the authenticity of the bartenders here. They're all chill, nice, talkative people that know how to have fun and aren't afraid to give you a hard time either. 

The drinks are delicious, many of the bartenders like to create their own concoctions for you to try, and the food is actually pretty fantastic for pub food. The atomic dog is my favorite, and I have been known to order it even after I've already had a full dinner. Oops.",1
uzsMilozioxCenzyXbVMmw,"I grew up in Texas (home of the best beef BBQ on the planet) and went to school in Virginia where I was introduced to genuine Carolina pork BBQ, and I've found nothing that rivals authentic southern BBQ - until now. I cannot rave enough about the quality of their BBQ. Slow cooked so it simply falls apart, and with a sampling of assorted BBQ sauces that enhance but don't overwhelm the meat. I always take my girlfriend so we can order both beef and pork and I can leave totally sated. The service has also been uniformly excellent and it's become a regular in our rotation.",1
uzsMilozioxCenzyXbVMmw,"One of my few five-star places. The service is friendly and the atmosphere laid back. No frills here, or contrived attempts to convey 'authenticity'. The food speaks for itself. 

I had the St Louis Style spare ribs with the Carolina Mustard Vinegar, as one should. The meat was perfectly cooked, and the sauce was out of this world. The seasoning is reason enough to come here, and is the best rib sauce I've had. 

As a nice bonus, the sides are excellent. The fries are nice and spicy and the bourbon beans are on a whole other level. Wow.

************
This girl has earned her BBQ stripes over the years.  I have been to many well-known and lesser-known BBQ places in Texas, North Carolina, St. Louis...you know, the BBQ belts.  So you could say I know authentic BBQ.  The BBQ at Rib Cage is not like these places.  True blue BBQ to me is the pronounced smoke-ring meat that has been cooked low and slow and melts in your mouth.  The meats were disappointing.  The pulled pork was swimming in sauce and looked like a runny chili on the plate.  Where was the pile of meat that just came off the smoker?  I have never been a fan of brisket so I can say I did not care for it but that is nothing new.  The house made sauces are all delicious!  The Mac and cheese was very bland...No character and underseasoned.  The BBQ beans are SUBLIME.. Smoky, flavorful and bold.  And the cornbread?  YO!!!!!  Wow so, so good.  but perhaps the pinnacle of the evening was the peanut butter pie.  From now on, that slice of evil will be my go-to PMS binge.  Stupidly good.  And rich.  PB lovers you must try this.

While Rib Cage meats are a far cry from traditional BBQ you will find in the BBQ belt, there is no denying the food is very tasty.  And its dive bar experience adds to its character.  Great music.",1
uZZnIe0KJEpFlJlYedrQsg,"First, let me say that I hope this restaurant lasts. I work and live near Uptown, and I want to see the small businesses here thrive. That being said, Inchin's is a national chain, which doesn't give me much hope that this location will improve.

On my first visit, I asked the waitress what she likes, and she recommended the lunch buffet. Thus with reluctance, but an open mind, that's what I tried. Unfortunately, it was the worst ""pan-Asian"" food I've ever had.

None of the dishes were authentic, none had any spice, and most were flavorless (or worse). The KungPao chicken was gooey, the Mandarin Chicken even moreso. The Curry Fish had no flavor in the sauce, which smelled and tasted like frying oil dilluted with water. The noodles were soggy. The steamed rice was not fresh. The highpoint were the ""spicy crispy chili chicken"" and similarly-named fried baby corn, neither of which was spicy or crispy, but both of which were at least edible.

My experience got even worse when I looked into the open kitchen and saw them prying open white plastic 3-gallon buckets of food. (The same kind of buckets you buy bulk paint in.) My guess is that the national brand makes the sauces and has them simply fry the protein before mixing. That's a fool-proof method many national chains use, but its nevertheless gross and unsettling to see it in practice. And it begs the question how everything that I sampled still ended up being so unflavorful.  

I'd feel remiss not to note that the staff was friendly, the service above-average, the atmosphere nice (although Orientalist and culturally insensitive), and the space was pretty clean. But the food was just too bad to go back.",0

My main qualm is that the lamb wrap I ordered about half of the lamb was still very under done and inedible.,1
VbPPexfp8wa7Fjqp3tRDmw,"This is my favorite middle eastern restaurant ever. Also, one of my favorite and most frequented places in Cleveland. I love it.

The starter plate is my number one addiction. I have never had a better hummus in my life. The starter plate comes with hummus, baba and tabouli, which is great to mix together.

I love the Chicken Shwarma sandwich, and my b/f loves the different vegan options. Maja dara (sp?!!) is his favorite, and he likes the falafel for a lighter lunch alongside the sampler.

Sometimes you have to wait a while for the food, but we really love the servers there. Great, authentic place. I love it.",1
VbPPexfp8wa7Fjqp3tRDmw,"This in my favorite middle-eastern restaurant in the Cleveland area, and among my favorite restaurants in the area.  It is extremely reasonably priced.  The food here is very authentic--be prepared for a rough ride: it can be quite spicy and the flavors quite intense.  The food is coarse and rugged...very filling, sometimes surprising you with the vivid flavors.  I love it.

I must emphasize--this place is very very reasonably priced.  The atmosphere is simple but nice; sometimes you will find a rowdy group of men arguing in Arabic about which soccer game to watch.  You feel almost as if you've stepped into a different world.",1
VBxKOEdjg7ryuA2Ni080rA,"Google ratings are numerous and complimentary so I decided to try it out. Fresh food cooked as you wait. Not really authentic Chinese food but I have a very high threshold as I come from Los Angeles/San Gabriel Valley, home of Chinese food. This place had a continuous string of people. Neighborhood a bit sketchy. I like that this is a mom and pop establishment.",1
vBZ0cwtWKUN4t6sFCpSFCw,"Went to this place for dinner after reading all the good reviews. Read the most recent reviews that the restaurant has just changed management, affecting their ratings a little. But I figured I would give it a chance. My spouse and I left disappointed and sore in our pockets. Will start with the bad.

- Half price sushi rolls on weeknights. We ordered the spider roll and salmon maki roll. When the rolls came, we were appalled by the size of the salmon maki. They were ridiculously small, a little bigger than 1/2 inch. The salmon were literally the size of boogers. Way off the mark from the standard size. Half price was $2.50. It was worth only a dollar in my opinion. The spider roll's ingredients supposed to consist of soft shell crab, avocado, some kind of small fried fish and cucumber. Size was ok, but ingredients were so miniscule and mashed up we didn't taste anything. Soft shell crab was just tiny battered shells, with the meatless tails sticking out on the 2 ends of the roll. Again, not worth even the half price. Should have sent back at least the salmon roll to let them know that what they were doing was unscrupulous. Advertising half off deals like that, and cheating on quantity. But we had to rush for a concert, so we didn't pursue it.  

The not-so-bad
- Ordered the early bird special sets too. Pricing for this was reasonable. Good size portions. Shrimps were huge. But was hoping for authentic Thai food but we got typical American influenced fair. Food was overly sweet. Summer rolls were nothing to rave about, with tiny bits of chicken and overload of vege. The crispy tofu appetizer was good. Pad Thai was good. 

The good
The saving grace of this place was the speedy and friendly service. True Thai hospitality and smile.

Paid $46 including tips for this meal, which we found grossly expensive, coz of the terrible sushi rolls. Could have gone to our regular Chinese restaurant and ordered lots of dishes and fed the whole family of 4 adults, 2 kids for that price.",0
vBZ0cwtWKUN4t6sFCpSFCw,"Had dinner here recently when my flight back to NY was canelled and I was stranded at the airport. 10 minutes away, and excellent, authentic Thai food. Service was excellent too, although the restaurant was empty at 8:30, so it may not be a fair test. Highly recommended.",1
vBZ0cwtWKUN4t6sFCpSFCw,"Tasty, authentic food and a very friendly staff.  We had a seafood dish with squid, clams, and shrimp with vegetables and fried rice.  Excellent!

They also have a solid bar including cocktails, beer, and wine.  Was pleasantly surprised they had Great Lakes beer in stock as well as more common American and Asian beers.

Cute atmosphere.  Great casual spot and a pleasant surprise to get such great Thai food in Ohio!",1
Vc8sXKEdO9yVxbRlwBFHKQ,"This is a very run-of-the-mill American Chinese restaurant.  It is not at all authentic.  The food is average in every way.  I haven't had anything truly bad here, nor have I had anything that was really all that good either.

The best aspect of this restaurant is the atmosphere; relative to the low price, you can sit down in peace and quiet in a relatively spacious, well-decorated environment.  The place looks small from the outside but has additional downstairs seating.  The prices are lower than what you would expect from a decent sit-down place like this.",1
VDHN8ahFFBX8cC7wSZoUIQ,"I grew up with my little old Ukranian grandmother making me homemade pierogies, mostly of the traditional potato variety. I have warm memories of flavorful, fresh pierogies and expected nothing less from Pierogi Palace given that Parma is a hive of Ukranians. I purchased pounds and pounds of all types of different flavors that I didn't realize existed in this type of cuisine and crossed my fingers that I wouldn't be disappointed. I was. Terribly. Like others have said, the dough is WAY too thick and the fillings just tasted odd. Maybe I'm just a traditionalist but these just didn't do it for me. I also felt ripped off. Pierogies are a poor man's food yet I almost went broke forking out for these. 

I recommend saving your money and visiting one of the local stores in Parma where you can get something more authentic.",0
VDHN8ahFFBX8cC7wSZoUIQ,"As a native Clevelander and my Ukrainian ancestors blood running through my veins, I can only ask ""Dear God - Pepperoni Pierogi? WHYYYYYY!!!!"" (camera panning back to focus in on my open, screaming mouth)

For the uninitiated and the uninformed, these pierogis are *not good*.

They are, in fact, terrible.   

The dough is too thick and fills your mouth with the most unappealing flour-y taste.  The ""crimp"" along the side is way too huge - thereby accenting the ""I ate too much peanut butter"" mealy-, clumping feeling.  The various ""flavors"" provided - like pizza - are not generous and fresh-tasting.

If you want very good, authentic pierogi in the West Side Market - visit Irene Dever's Dairy.   They have the traditional varieties (potato, cheese - not cheddar cheese but sweet'ish, dry cottage cheese, sauekraut, and the barely authentic potato/cheese mix.  If you call ahead, you can order prune (very good - try it) or apricot.    If you are very motivated - drive to St. Josephat's Ukrainian Church on State Road and buy pierogi from the little old ladies in the back building.  There are over a dozen of them seated at long tables, hand-making these treasures.   Call ahead as they are not open every day.

Pizza pierogi?  Never.  'Nuff said.",0
vdloJPM3bSpQTMlwdFek2A,"We really enjoyed the patio for some beers and appetizers on a late Saturday afternoon. They weren't busy outside and our service was excellent. Everyone was pleased with their beers and we snacked on the soft pretzels, served warm with cheese and grainy mustard, and the patatas bravas. The patatas were amazing, not super authentic to Spanish food but so good. We didn't opt for egg or chorizo on them and it wasn't necessary.",1
VdnqeZXVfTRYB_ASLp8umg,This place has the best authentic Indian food!!! It is the gem of Lee road! It is a great place for meat lovers and vegetarians alike!,1
VdnqeZXVfTRYB_ASLp8umg,"If you're looking to satisfy your Indian food cravings and don't mind spending a little more for authentic cuisine, you can always eat at The Cafe Tandoor Restaurant situated on South Taylor, Cleveland Heights.  Service is excellent and fast. I walked in and sat at the bar to order take-out and I was greeted by one of the owners.  He was super nice, helpful and provided me much insight on entrees to try on my next visit.  For $40, I ordered 2 entrees of butter chicken, 1 side of basmati rice, 1 side of vegetable samosas and 1 side of naan bread.  I wish I could have taken pictures when I got home but I was so hungry and the food was so good, I couldn't stop eating. I definitely plan to come back soon and try his suggestions. Yes, the food is slightly expensive but with Cafe Tandoor being in business for over 25 years serving authentic Indian food and providing great customer service and cleanliness , I think it's well worth it.",1
VdnqeZXVfTRYB_ASLp8umg,"I enjoyed a savory selection of vibrant vegetarian dishes here as a pleasant change of pace, including the veggie samosa, aloo ghobi, and malai kofta. The service was excellent and the authentic ambiance also appreciated. I'll be sure to test the Tandoor (Oven) on a near-future visit.",1
VdnqeZXVfTRYB_ASLp8umg,"This is really excellent.  I've happened to eat there a couple of times on two-for-one wine night on Tuesdays.  I highly recommend this place.  Plus, I really miss not eating Indian food more often.  India was part of my biz dev territory, years back, and I miss the authentic cuisine, which you can get in the UK , too.",1
VdnqeZXVfTRYB_ASLp8umg,"I ordered veggie briyani and chicken tikka masala, both regular spicy level (because other places like indian flame give you some insanely spicy food!). Usually, I'm sent to the crazy nirvana when I taste Indian food. Instead, I experienced rather bland, unimpressive taste with not much punch of the authentic Indian elephant sized scent and depth of the Hindu goddess. First thing I thought when I tasted the briyani was, ""Why am I still worried about my bills? And why does this taste so sweeeet?""

Steer clear. This is Americanized Indian food. That's why they also charge extra for rice. The American way baby! Like the American cars, the engine never got revving.",0
VdnqeZXVfTRYB_ASLp8umg,"Went there just the other day and loved our meal! We ordered the garlic naan, and aloo paratha to start with. Both were fresh and yuuuum. Husband got chicken tika masala and I got the vegetarian eggplant dish which I can't remember the name of for the life of me! But everything was good, fresh, and authentic! We got the saffron rice which was just 50c more and and oh so worth it. Haha. Not sure why this place has such bad reviews. 
Pro tip- dishes may be a little more mild than what you would get at other Indian places. Next time I go, I'm asking them medium spice at lease.",1
VEeqUTODkjwera_JKy97rg,"So far, it seems they have one big important thing right at Wicked Taco: The Food! The tacos were excellent. I recommend authentic style, if you want to have real, simple tacos with a real shell. (though only single wrapped, I prefer it that way!). For those talking about the warmth of the food, its a small amount of meat and lots toppings. Tacos are usually served that way, and open-faced. If you want something hot get the burrito or ask about what is warm. I will say the interior of the place really needs some more love, but its not the decor that you come for: its the tacos!",1
veXxt8rGY_RJPpA5QkHT9Q,"We were so excited to try this place today! We are from Dallas Texas, where you can throw a rock up in the air and it will probably land on a taco joint. Since we are new to Cleveland, and haven't found much for authentic Mexican cuisine, my husband and I were thrilled to hear about Barrio. Today we tried one of each of the brunch tacos, as well as chips and salsa and guacamole. The chips were super fresh! And this place even gave us chip refills without us needing to ask. They are not stingy with the chips! Pretty good salsa as well. The brunch tacos seemed rather experimental. The chicken and waffles taco was not as good as expected.. mainly because of the collard greens. The salmon taco was weird but.. I mean.. what do you expect ordering a salmon taco? My husband thought it was exactly what he expected and he liked it. I enjoyed my other two brunch tacos of huevos rancheros and huevos con machaca. They could have been warmer and had a little too much sour cream for my taste.. We will definitely return to try the regular tacos! I also loved the atmosphere! Really cool walls and decor overall. 

One suggestion: soft corn tortillas would be much appreciated and make these tacos more authentic. So far, soft corn tortillas seem to be hard to find in this part of the US. 

Overall: Happy to find a decent taco joint in our new neighborhood!",1
veXxt8rGY_RJPpA5QkHT9Q,"Need a way to get me out of bed? Just say ""Barrio?"" and I'm in! The Cleveland Heights location was just the best thing to come to the Cedar Fairmount area. You can make your meal as cheap as possible with their $3 basic tacos. Or, spice it up with that Green Goddess goodness, which is $1 extra. (California girl in me is a little biased to guac on/in everything). They have one menu where you can customize your tacos - it took me about 3 visits to pin down *the one*. Or, if you aren't as adventurous (c'mon...), they do have another menu with tacos that you can just order. 

My favorite is the Green Goddess with the Shrimp with Garlic Cream and mango habanero and the toppings depends on how I feel that night. They have monthly specials that get pretty creative... They can be a hit or a miss honestly, but I usually am willing to try it. If you're like me, I usually am eagerly watching out for their post on social media for the guac of the month. They'll have a unique taco, queso, guac, and two drink choices for the month on a separate menu. I usually like to get the ""Tres Amigos"" and get the special queso, special guac, and the Tuscan guac (my fave). This way, I can try the special queso and guac in smaller portions, without having to share :P. 

If you want some dessert, they don't have churros unfortunately, but they do have chocotacos (vanilla or cayenne). They mix cayenne pepper in the vanilla ice cream for the latter. If you're afraid of it being spicy, I don't think it is - though I have a high tolerance for spice. It doesn't change the flavor so I'd recommend it. It can easily be shared by two, since they cut it in half. 

I'm personally not a fan of tequila drinks, but I do love their raspberry marg with the cayenne sugar rim. 

I usually come during the late night happy hour from 9 - 11 PM on weekdays (someone double check me on that but I know they usually advertise their 4 - 7 PM happy hour on weekdays as well). This discount only works IF YOU SIT IN THE BAR AREA. They discount $1 on tacos, $1 off drafts, and half off margaritas - but you can get a flavored marg for $1 more, or upgrade to a top shelf margarita for $1 extra. Or both! This is usually when I'll ""splurge"" and get the Green Goddess taco with the Coca-Cola marinated steak, both of which are $1 extra. But, there's the $1 discount during happy hour, so it makes me feel better about it. Barrio usually isn't as packed during the late night hours, so I've never had a problem getting a table within 5 minutes. 

I frequent their weekend brunch as well. I love me some chicken and waffle taco *drool* - but it is not for everyone. I like the bitterness of the collard greens contrasted with the sweet maple syrup on the waffle crusted chicken and strips of bacon. I'd recommend the French Toast bowl and the Biscuits and Gravy bowl, as they seem to be well-received by everyone that I've persuaded to join me for brunch there. They also serve mimosas during brunch, so win-win. 

Now the gripes..

* Be warned that if you try to come during peak dining hours that you will likely have a wait. If you have a group larger than 6, that wait can be long. You have the option of hanging out at the bar, but the place is so small and everyone crowds inside if it is too hot or too cold outside. They do have a small outdoor patio in the back, which is nice when the weather is nice. 
* Because of the nature of the custom tacos, it is very easy to find yourself with a taco isn't what you ordered. Please do me a favor - check your tacos (they will check your ticket) and if something is off, tell the waiter/waittress - they're very receptive to getting you the right taco. Don't be a dick. If you're hangry, just eat more of the chips and salsa and save your complaining. 
* Barrio isn't really ""authentic"" Mexican food so it bothers me when people try to knock it down for that. Go somewhere else then. 
* The Cleveland Heights location closes at 1 AM, so all alcohol has to be consumed by midnight. Just be warned..we had to finish off a pitcher because we didn't know this. The waitress was nice about letting us know about that - they'll take your drinks away if you don't finish it, I think..
* Parking around this area is tricky during peak hours. There are metered parking lots up Grandview and next to Nighttown, down the street - so carpool when you can and bring quarters.",1
veXxt8rGY_RJPpA5QkHT9Q,"The place was upbeat and the drinks were really good. The margaritas we ordered were excellent. But tacos were very disappointing. Coming from Texas, and having eaten so much Mexican food, authentic and Tex-Mex, I was sorely disappointed. I had tried their chicken and shrimp tacos.",0
veXxt8rGY_RJPpA5QkHT9Q,"An abomination against god, Beelzebub, and man.

White people owe Mexico yet another apology for this one. How the hell are there multiple locations for this restaurant. Absolutely shameful. Everything tastes like a child getting creative with store bought, pre made taco ingredients. Nothing authentic about it at all. Everything was either too sweet or too salty (including the quacamole). Honestly, don't come here. If you want Ortega brand taco spices, pre shredded bag cheese, and canned beans... go to the supermarket. Nothing is cooked right, and even the tortillas are bad. At 4 bucks a pop, I'd rather get punched in the dick than ever eat here again. The wait stuff is nice and fast, but seriously, the food is worse than vomit. You will like this food if you enjoy being chained up in a basement and hit in the mouth over and over again with a lead pipe. Seriously, cool angst music and sugar skulls don't make food good. What the fuck? There really must not be a god. The most fun we had eating here is trashing the trash food. If you fed it to your dog I would call the ASPCA on you. It is the Chef Boy-r-D of Mexican food, if Chef Boy-r-D was Pietro Manzoni, that artist who pooped in cans.",0

Update: I have eaten at Barrio two more times and tried all sorts of tacos and both times were disappointing because I feel this restaurant has potential to be so much better. Are cold and creamy tacos the hip cool popular thing here in Cleveland? I didn't want to finish mine. I couldn't. For the price, these tacos should be much more fresh, and definitely hot! The last time I visited Barrio, they didn't even get our order right. I'm confused. On a cold rainy weekend night, people pile into Barrio by the bunches and stand around with mediocre margaritas waiting for a seat at the bar or a table. So good for Barrio! The demand is there. I think the issues here is Barrio's ability to deliver quality tacos to such a continuous high capacity and demand. 

So again, Barrio, I may return in a year to see if the tacos have improved because I really want to like this place but I have had really below average tacos here 3 times in a row.",0
veXxt8rGY_RJPpA5QkHT9Q,"Unbeatable happy hour. $3 margaritas & $2 tacos? Count me in! When I bring friends from out of town here they're always floored by the price and experience of Barrio. It's one of the best places for a fun and casual dinner that won't break the bank. Although it's not authentic Mexican by any means, their concept and variety of choices is always a huge hit. The free chips and salsa are addicting, and the service is always fast. The tacos are also a pretty good portion (usually filled with 2). It's often a wait to get a table during happy hour or weekend nights but usually there's a pretty fast turnaround. Love the artwork on the walls and the lively atmosphere. A Cleveland favorite for sure!",1
veXxt8rGY_RJPpA5QkHT9Q,"Great place. One of my favorite establishments in Cleveland. It's not authentic but who cares. It's a great place to order custom tacos, have chips and salsa and grab a few beers before or after the game. Great value and a lot of fun. If you want something reasonable on a game day I recommend this. Way better than some generic sports bar junk food",1
veXxt8rGY_RJPpA5QkHT9Q,"I have been to Barrio SEVERAL times and I really need to give it an honest review. It is decent and just OK. The tacos are cheap and tasty; however, they are NOT authentic. Also, they are only good if you have an eye for picking the right ingredients for a build-your-own taco. Certain mixtures of ingredients and sauces are just not good. The margaritas are definitely tasty and adequately strong, but overpriced! The only time they are worth it is at Happy Hour. I am vegetarian and it makes me extremely angry that I have to pay extra for rice and beans on my tacos. These simple additions make an otherwise cheap taco quite expensive and definitely not worth the money. If I can't have beans for free, what's the point? The ambiance here is pretty cool and the new Fairmount location is spacious, that's nice.",0
veXxt8rGY_RJPpA5QkHT9Q,"I guess I'm just not drinking the Barrio kool aid. 

The food is fine. It's yummy, but I've never been astounded by anything I had there. The drink options are solid too.

For me, it's justâE that the menu isn't worth the loud atmosphere and slowish service.  I'd rather go to an authentic, family-ownedâE restaurantâE for tacos. I know some places where I'd get twice the food for half the price and awesomeâE service.",0
veXxt8rGY_RJPpA5QkHT9Q,"Overall this is a great place to go with friends and grab a quick margarita and taco.
Nothing fancy, prices are fair, staff always friendly.
Often very busy but it makes sense given the area.
If you're looking for authentic street tacos (or if you're from California, Texas, Southwest or Mexico) this probably isn't what you're looking for but I find the chef combinations to be very thoughtful and tasty. 
I'm personally a big authentic Mexican street taco guy but the stoner shell is so good I still find myself going back for it. El Jefe Loco is my go to.
Many good memories with friends here.
Be sure to check your take out orders before you go if you have a common name. Mistakes happen, won't put too much of an emphasis on it. Manager and staff were understanding and refunded me my money, I appreciated that.",1
veXxt8rGY_RJPpA5QkHT9Q,"Barrio is the place to be, can I get an amen?!  
As a proud African American Mexican woman, it's awesome how authentically Barrio reflects my roots in their food.  
Their queso is quite sexual, though it does give me a queso(f) the sh*ts if I eat too much of it.  Sorry to be so crass, but that's just the facts yo.  
At this location, the staff is often a little rude, especially the guy with the colored contacts and skeleton-like appearance.  He is creepy.  
In the summer, I love shoveling tacos down my throat on their outdoor patio and washing them down with a (virgin, because I ain't no sinner) margarita.  Barrio, baby, keep doin' what you're doin'!",0
veXxt8rGY_RJPpA5QkHT9Q,"Overrated. Overpriced for what it is. Not that it claims to be anything near authentic, but nowhere near Mexican food. Been here a lot and have gotten a mix of great service and some horrible service that made me nearly walk out. This server was super rude, had a terrible attitude, yelled at our table for writing a note about sauces on the side at the top of the paper (side note: don't do that because that's where they write table info down and the servers will just totally disparage you for doing so)(side side note: getting sauces on the side will cost you an extra $0.50 per sauce if you have 3 or more I believe), and would just walk away while we were mid-sentence, mid-question. For this treatment alone, I should be leaving a 1 star review because this is where my group went for my friends birthday dinner. We were treated like this on her birthday! Luckily we were able to be reseated but not without a permanently sour taste in our mouths about this Barrio experience. 

That experience aside, I'd recommend the elote queso and the Tuscan guacamole. For these appetizers, it's really most cost effective to do the Tres Amigos order, in which you get any three gaucs/quesos/salsas for $12. Also I'd recommend the guava margarita blended. Tacos are unimpressive. You're better off not getting one. Watery and they fall apart immediately.",0
vFW3KiE897g-MRr4FLqr7w,"Mama Mia is this the place to go if you are looking for some authentic Italian Food! Not only do they have every lunch meat and all the fixins' imaginable, but they also have homemade Italian bakery. 

My fiance' and I have our staples when we go there, a pound of Capicola, 1/2 pound of Swiss Cheese, 1 tub of Roasted Red Pepper, and a fresh loaf of baked bread... put it all together and add some butter..WHALA.. you have an amazing Capicola Sandwich. The Prosciutto is also amazing, especially if you wrap asparagus with it!! 

Enough about the meat, let's get to my favorite the BAKERY!! I am a sweets kinda girl and let me tell you, they have the best biscotti, and you have to try the Almond cookies... to die for!! Plus, you must get a cannoli while you are there! Best cannolis around town!! 

In addition to the meats and bakery, they have some groceries mostly for Italian Cooking. 

Also, if you happen to go there hungry, have no fear! They have a section where you can order food to go, SWEET, HUH!

They are moderately priced, but for what you are getting, it's definitely worth it!!",1
vFW3KiE897g-MRr4FLqr7w,"""We're not in the lunch line ... we're waiting for olives"" ... some friendly guests told me as I stepped into line to get some lunch at Gus's. YES -  they have a large selection of olives and many other mostly Italian type items. And yes, it is a joy just to go there and look around.

They also have a huge selection of wine, vinegar, olive oil, cheeses and other fun mostly imported stuff.  I'm not overly educated on where they get their meats and other perishable fair, but it seems abundant and fresh as well.

Mostly, I go there to grab a little lunch (take-out) and remind myself that Cleveland is a real city with authentic people and character. The people here are friendly but not overly so - if you are ordering in the heat of the lunch-hour, you might wanna announce your order quickly and not-quietly to keep the flow moving. 

As for location - Gallucci's spot it town is a reminder that poverty still exists right next door.  This is not a neighborhood to take someone if you are trying to convince them this is a city without challenges. However, most people probably realize Cleveland has challenges ;)

My tip: try the eggplant parm sandwich at the lunch counter - if you like this sort of thing, you won't be disappointed.",1
vFW3KiE897g-MRr4FLqr7w,"A midtown district must. This was my absolute favorite lunch spot when I was working downtown. Gallucci's has an amazing lunch menu with so many different options. I'm talking pizza, pasta, sandwiches, sausages - you name it. They're always so busy for lunch, but the line moves quickly and the food is always worth the wait. I never paid more than ten dollars for a meal, and I always left very full and satisfied. Gallucci's never disappoints! 

Since Gallucci's is an Italian market, you have your pick of loads of fresh ingredients to grab for dinner later on. They have shelves and shelves full of authentic Italian cheeses, sauces, meats, oils, etc. for your next pizza or pasta dish. This is all in addition to their deli, bakery, olive bar, and wine selection.

The staff at Gallucci's is just as amazing as the food they sell. They are all so kind and polite and will give you great recommendations. I'm disappointed I'm no longer a block away, but I'll definitely be back.",1

They also have a good selection of seafood needed to make traditional meals that you won't find just anywhere. And they have fresh pasta and their canned sauce if you want to cheat and have a ""kind of"" home cooked meal. 

Their deli counter has all the specialties. Whether you're looking for prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, guanciale, or anything else you may need for an authentic recipe. 

It also has ample parking.",1

The chips and specifically salsa they bring for the table are very good.

VH2BjFjc9usDquDgoHhptA,Waitress was really quick and friendly. Tacos were ok. my friend said there's meat in here somewhere. Small but tasty. I ordered a Mango Margarita and it was green! I said I have never had a mango any thing that was green! NO Mango flavor at all! They have a premixed margarita slushy machine! Nothing authentic about this place! Would NOT go back.Nice atmosphere Only soft tacos! You write your order on paper and hand it to waitress! IF YOU' RE JUST DOING TACOS MAKE SOFT AND HARD AND MAKE REAL DRINKS!,0
VH2BjFjc9usDquDgoHhptA,"Tacos were okay, not very authentic.  Flour tortillas?  WTF.

Beer was good!",0
VH2BjFjc9usDquDgoHhptA,"For some reason unbeknownst to me, Clevelanders rave about this place. Very underwhelming ""Mexican food."" Location/setting is good, but the food is just inauthentic and the taste is subpar to say the least. They have a lot of signature tacos but they honestly didn't get the basics right in the first place.",0
VH2BjFjc9usDquDgoHhptA,"Great price, big servings, and super tasty ($4.50 for a large specialty taco). Definitely not what I would call authentic Mexican , but some of the best bar food I've ever had!",1
VH2BjFjc9usDquDgoHhptA,"As a Native Texan living in Ohio, I am a little bit of a taco snob. But I think I've finally found a taco place that reminds me of home. The simplicity is there, the flavors are there, the margaritas are there, the price is right, therefore, I am there! The secret taco sauce is great on just about anything. My boyfriend raved about the pulled pork. This probably going to end up on my Cleveland's Best Taco list. 

The only downfall of this place is that they are only open for lunch on the weekends. With the downtown location, they should really be taking advantage of the lunch crowd during the week. If they were open, my co-workers and I would probably go there more often since we are right down the street.

My advice: If you are not that hungry, only get one taco. You will save money and you know you're going to fill up on chips anyway. And try the secret taco sauce!",1
VH2BjFjc9usDquDgoHhptA,"You say tacos and I am there in an instant.  We passed Barrio walking into town and were told its a really popular spot with great food so we stopped in on a Saturday night around 730.  Off the bat, it definitely seemed like our kind of place - large, bustling and duh, with tacos!  We started with a margarita and the trio that comes with your choice of salsa, guac and other dip...We chose the corn salsa, white cheese queso and their special of the day guac.  All were very good.  Chips were fresh but in a smaller bowl so we had to keep getting refills for the size of the serving of the dips.

Next, we ordered 3 tacos each. One taco of the day, one make your own and one off the menu.  The taco of the day (it was made with pork belly) was by far, the best.  Others were just OK.  Neither of us finished the other two tacos.

I think this place is amazing for a happy hour spot where you can get appetizers and fun food, but I think the tacos are really lacking.  I have been to a LOT of taco spots and normally I will only eat at them if they have a soft, authentic corn tortilla option.  I think it makes such a difference.  Unfortunately, here they only serve them on soft flour or hard corn (or you can order a combination of the two).  It seems basic to me and underwhelming compared to what I think they could do with corn tortillas.

I will say the meats on the tacos were cooked well, and the tacos themselves had great flavor, but it just wasn't all there for either of us.

The atmosphere and service get 5 stars, but probably wouldn't go back for a sit-down meal.  Definitely would try somewhere else I think.",1
VH2BjFjc9usDquDgoHhptA,"I'm so happy that I finally visited the often talked about BARRIO. If you are looking for delicious TACO's then this is the place for you. The taco's are probably not as authentic as tacos from Mexico but they appeal to foodies and taste great.

Barrio is located in downtown Cleveland close to 5th street Arcade and close to the many restaurants/bars along 4th street. Parking may be a pain because it is most street parking and paid lots. I was over at Voinovich park so I walked over from that park which took about 10 mins.

TACO's -- The way ordering works here is that you first pick your tortilla, then your protein option (beans, tofu, chicken, etc), then you pick your toppings, cheese, salsa, and sauces. There is a sheet of paper at the table where you mark down what you want to order. You can pick from a selection of set tacos or make your own from the 'Build Your Own' menu. I choose tacos from the 'Build Your Own' menu. I got 1 chicken taco ($3) plus 1 shrimp taco ($3). The pre-made taco's are $4 each. 

For my chicken tacos, I chose the hard and soft shell combination ($1 extra) and this turned out to be delicious and it made me more full/satisfied than getting the traditional soft or hard taco shell. I added cilantro-lime rice to my tacos. For my 2nd taco. I ordered the JalapeÁE±o Lime Shrimp that came with lettuce, corn, and tomatoes. I got this taco on a soft shell. 

Overall, the tacos were delicious so were the chips and salsa. The cilantro pesto ",1
VH2BjFjc9usDquDgoHhptA,"Bad service. Bad food. Grimy menus. Barrio is an example of cultural appropriation. You are not getting an authentic Mexican experience but I'm not sure if Clevelanders care much about that. It's fairly segregated with a sprinkling of people of color. My waiter asked for and held on to my credit card to start my tab. Apparently it's their custom to hold on to the patron's credit card (yes, I asked about it), which is bizarre. In the day of identity theft, it is simply not wise to leave your credit card with the waiter. But I had just arrived to Cleveland to attend my friend's wedding and was too tired to argue or too hungry to find another restaurant.

I ordered lemonade but was given water instead. When I asked my server again for lemonade, she said that she already brought the lemonade (which was literally a slice of lemon in a glass of water). She then told me they had to prepare the lemonade and it would take awhile. Not once did she check on me even though she checked on everyone else at the bar. I had to flag her town several times. 

In addition to the abysmal service, the food was pretty bad. The tacos were soggy and just plain messy. The chips and salsa were ok. Oh, and the kitchen made a mistake and gave me an extra taco. If only I actually liked the food. It was a busy evening but I have a vague suspicion that it's unfortunately the norm to be careless around here. 

Overall, the experience leaves little to be desired and I would not recommend.",0
Vj-QgRXDpCm7vLBBSckx8g,"The food here is pretty good, and so far it's one of my favorite diner style restaurants in Cleveland, more for its relaxed atmosphere than anything else.  There's counter seating that overlooks the grill and about 10 tables, so it's fairly small and cozy.  The folks that run the place are authentically friendly, and you get just the right amount of service that doesn't cross into annoyance like many chain restaurants.

Sammy's closes early, just like everything else in downtown, so make sure you check the hours before venturing out to find it.  I walked past the building several times looking for this place before I realized it was inside the same building as the Holiday Inn Express.  You'll have to walk past the hotel parking kiosk to get in.",1
vkKVf0hLjjnN047fWXhThQ,"The prices are great, and they really go all out with the seasonal decor. It's certainly a neighborhood bar on tie dive-y side, which is something I like. There are no windows, which gives its atmosphere great continuity. I'd give them 5 stars except the service seems to run slow, even though they usually have 3 weekend evening bartenders for a small place. That being said, the short haired lady does constantly patrol the bar checking on people, which is lovely. They have maybe half a dozen televisions but it's in no way a sports bar, and it's certainly not a hipster hangout (too authentic ""bar,"" I guess!). I haven't tried the food so I can't rate that, but it looks and smells good, and the place appears clean.",1
VMcUG1dw4ldI_ldA2lGyEA,"Kan Zaman was an all around Great experience. Very different from the typical ""steak and potatoes"" restaurants. The ambiance was great with an authentic Middle Eastern theme. We started off with a hookah (Best price on hookah I've seen in Cle.) The food was Great. Me and my wife started with this trio dip sampler with homemade tabouli, pajan (spell check) and humus. All  Very Good! They even wrap the naan bread individually in plastic, a refreshing touch. Then came the LAMB CHOPS! Oh my goodness, absolutely devine!! Charbroiled and pan seared to Perfection. I had rice and salad with it as well. We'll definitely come back soon! Oh and the prices were great too! 

Things to consider: There's a $20+ cover for a booth or you can sit in the patio. 15% Gratuity is Included in the total cost of your meal. Also, the parking lot is small and the more people that come, the crazier the parking gets.",1
VO1SeTHJ4itgNNvS5Bm_xQ,"They sold me a fake Picasso drawing, It took me longer than the 30 days to get it authenticated by Pablo Picasso's son Claude. So they would not give me my money back.

VUOn9pztnaEX49Xfb_9L7A,"Was in the mood to eat Italian, downtown, authentic and this place fit the bill. Yes it's a pricier place, yet understood prior to going in.  Lamb shank was incredible along with chicken and other pasta dishes.  Wine was varied and was offered help and suggestions hit the mark.  Desert was very good.  Overall, above average, great service, fun place and recommended.",1
VUOn9pztnaEX49Xfb_9L7A,"My boyfriend and I were going to head out to Little Italy this weekend for the Feast of Assumption, but we decided to stop into Osteria for a few cocktails and appetizers first.  I had taken him here before a year ago for his birthday and we had a great experience. Very intuitive and attentive service, divine food and even a friendly invite back for their live Sinatra singer! We've been meaning to come back to check it out since then, but just got around to it now. 

WOW. 

Forget about ""The Feast""...we stayed at Osteria all night! 

First off, the atmosphere was so awesome. You feel like you're in a private club for A-listers, but it's also really romantic. It's like we were part of an elite group of people who knew about this Cleveland gem, and they like it that way!  The lighting is dim, the space is modest and quite small, but the lounge singer is what really made the night. Rick, who was one half the Sinatra-ish style lounge act called ""Rick & Sharona"", kept us dancing and smiling all night long. He was so interactive and nice. At one point he even threw top hats out to the ladies (me included) and encouraged us to get up and have some fun. 

The service was impeccable, as usual. We immediately grabbed a seat at the bar so we could have a great view of the singer. The bartender helped me pick a great wine, I didn't even have to ask! It's like he read my mind.  For the rest of the night, our glasses never went empty. He was always there when we needed something, but not annoying.  

The food? Oh my god, the food!! I mean, I wasn't surprised that it was amazing...it was last time too. But nothing can really prepare you for biting into the creamy, fresh taste of buffalo mozzarella cheese, breaded and served with a cucumber puree and herbs.  The crustini with chef inspired spreads was not only fun to eat, but delicious. There was a white bean hummus, sun-dried tomato, pesto and a roasted mushroom spread...YUM! Even something as simple as the caprese salad blew us away! They used a balsamic vinaigrette reduction that was divine. 

What an incredible night at Osteria. Slow dancing, singing, and laughing all while enjoying incredible cuisine. What more could you ask for? If you're looking for an authentic Italian dinner mixed with romance and fun, this is where you need to go!",1
VVjevjhveDcoRW-O1uT3Vw,"Technically, I guess my original review was less of a review and more of a description on how my day went at La Gelateria.  I for reals love gelato!  I could not go without a day without it while traveling throughout Europe.  And I think it's pretty sweet that we all can enjoy the authentic flavors right next door. 

Tried pistachio and mint chip, both very excellent.  The bummer is that some flavors, like pistachio, is charged an extra dollar.  I'm not sure why. Also, I wouldn't hesitant to try any of the other fruit or coffee flavors. 

Ordered a pizza here once.  It wasn't bad, but nothing to really rave about either.  Wasn't a fan on being skimped on the toppings.",1

W07TY9cx2ZpDQyAn0ynMQg,"For authentic and friendly service and food Terry Tarantino does it like no one else. He catered to our family personally late in the evening and in celebration of my daughter in laws 21st birthday. As an Italian she described the food in remembrance of eating with her grandmother. He served up family style pesto, angel hair marinara, meatballs, French salad with sheep milk feta, barley and fresh vegetables with Tara misu. The wine flowed, the conversation never ended, Terry became as much a part of our family and party that evening as any other. If you're looking for great food in the European experience go to La Dolce Vita.",1
W07TY9cx2ZpDQyAn0ynMQg,"I love coming here each time I'm in Cleveland! The atmosphere is so authentic and the food is amazing! My favorite by far being the gnocchi. The service has always been spot on and most meals they will bring around free samples. Last night we received the a fruit dessert on the house, delicious. Great place for a romantic date or just a great catch up with friends.",1
W07TY9cx2ZpDQyAn0ynMQg,Super yummy place! Seems very authentic and good flavor!  I ordered the scallop special they were cooked perfectly.  The owner brought over specials from the kitchen and a large fruit and ricotta plate!   Very good and priced right!    They are going to start serving creamy panna cotta soon!!,1
W07TY9cx2ZpDQyAn0ynMQg,"We loved sitting outdoors and enjoying authentic Italian cuisine. More than the food and ambiance, the servers were EXCEPTIONAL!! Valan and Abdul especially made this dinner worth it. They learned we were breaking our fast, and made sure we were well fed. We were treated like royalty, given a special house appetizer and dessert to break our fast. The recommendations were perfect. We chatted with our server throughout the evening. The service was quick, efficient, friendly, and the main reason I would go back (the food is awesome too!). Valan and the team, especially those who worked so hard even while fasting, were so memorable. After leaving, we all noted that their service alone made this one of the most memorable dining experiences we have ever had.",1
W07TY9cx2ZpDQyAn0ynMQg,Great atmosphere and the staff was very helpful and provided recommendations that were spot on! Pasta is great as well as their pizza. The owner personally comes out and chats with patrons which adds to an authentic Italian eatery ambiance.,1
W07TY9cx2ZpDQyAn0ynMQg,"Wow! I don't have enough good things to say about this restaurant, its staff and owner, Terry. This was hands down, one of the best meals & restaurants experiences I have ever had. The food was AMAZING. It was so authentic, flavorful and fresh! The portions were very large for the price too. The service was amazing, our waitress and hostess were attentive and sweet. The atmosphere was perfect and Terry was phenomenal. He took the time to get to know us and showered us with samples of food and drink! We even got a free dessert of fresh fruit and sweet ricotta that we devoured even though we were totally full. This meal and time we spent at La Dolce Vita was the highlight of my trip. I will definitely be a returning customer the next time I am in Cleveland and will recommend this outstanding establishment to everyone! Thank you Terry!",1
W07TY9cx2ZpDQyAn0ynMQg,"As someone who lived in Italy, I know authentic food when I taste it. This place was amazing. The food was light and authentic. This is as motherland as it gets. I have looked for a restaurant like this in Los Angeles and have failed to find anything like it. . Prices are high but the food is worth it. I would fly from LA to Cleveland just to eat here :) Try it!!! I ate here twice in the course of 4 days :D",1

W07TY9cx2ZpDQyAn0ynMQg,"Relaxing and authentic vibe, waiters and staff were very friendly and on top of our table, and most of all the owner, I'm assuming Terry, was extremely friendly and thanked us personally for making a reservation and shook our hands as we left. Would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a great Italian restaurant with a great staff. We got a free appetizer and dessert!",1
W07TY9cx2ZpDQyAn0ynMQg,"We felt like we walked into an old time, family-owned Italian restaurant when we stepped through the door. The owner greeted us as he passed, sat down with us and shared stories, then later fished out some complimentary Romano bow-tie noodles from the pot as he passed. The server was personable, knowledgeable and spent plenty of time with us explaining the best of the menu (everything).

The food was authentic, obviously fresh, with just the right amount of fresh spice. I highly recommend the Italian wedding soup and the chicken parm (tender chicken with just the right amount of crispness). My daughter was a huge fan of the fresh gnocchi.

The service was excellent, the food was generous and tasted great.

I wish there were fewer chains in the world and more restaurants like this. Thank you for a wonderful evening!",1
W07TY9cx2ZpDQyAn0ynMQg,Very good authentic italion food.  Very nice atmosphere with good service. Recommendations by the owner were spot on.,1
W07TY9cx2ZpDQyAn0ynMQg,"Really, just terrible. Bad service, awful food, expensive. We took some westside family members to see Little Italy, and they insisted on eating at a place with outdoor tables -- the one bright spot, we had lovely weather. This was a Saturday afternoon, about 1:30PM. The place was mostly empty but even so, we had appalling service. Waited to get water, waited for our orders to be taken...waited FOREVER for our food and then longer for our check. I'd guess it took about 2 to 2.5 hours for 4 adults and one child to eat lunch! This was not ""leisurely"" but annoying. We had an antsy kid with us! The wait made us miss some of the things we wanted to see that afternoon.

Had the food been delicious, this might have been partly forgiveable, but it was just awful. I've had far better meals at Olive Garden. This was NOT authentic Italian food. I had an artichoke pizza -- a huge cracker-type crust topped with gobs of ricotta, CANNED artichokes (cold) and lots of canned spinach. My husband had ""eggplant de giorno"", which was two tiny thin slices of eggplant topped with giant globs of ricotta ($9). One guest had chicken parm, which was baked chicken with MORE RICOTTA and some pasta, and the other had fettucini with spring vegetables -- those were $22 and $24 EACH, with no salads. The fettucini which I tasted was gummy noodles, all clumped up, in what tasted like watered down Campbell's tomato soup. Seriously. Oh -- two people had lentil soup, which came lukewarm and mostly some kind of grain (barley?) and hardly any lentils. One person didn't even finish it! ($5 for a small bowl).

Bread was good, and the one nice touch was they brought us a complimentary bowl of fresh blueberries at the end -- maybe out of embarrassment at making wait such ridiculous times for such terrible food.

Probably the worst meal I have ever had in Little Italy. On top, when we went inside to use the bathroom, the restaurant is grimey and rundown, totally lacking in either charm or cleanliness. Staff is apathetic. AVOID! AVOID!",0
W07TY9cx2ZpDQyAn0ynMQg,"On a picturesque summer visit to the University Circle area, my friend and I had a hankering for a tasteful dinner and a nice atmosphere. Walking under a train track, we came across a the sweet sounds and the clear air of Little Italy. This district was bustling and alive (in contrast to most of the rest of Ohio).  It was an enclave of life. The question was, where would we eat?

We came across this centrally located restaurant perched on a corner. The patio was oh, so inviting, with spirited opera recordings of Andrea Bocelli. We decided to scrap our college student value instinct and pay the price to sit in the tranquility of the patio. The service was prompt. Our water was constantly refilled. Warm, fresh bread was brought to our table with the nice touch of a creamy, rich butter. We decided to get some of the pasta dinners. For 17 bucks, I ordered the Abruzze which featured pasta with a red plumb tomato sauce and ground veal/beef. The meat tasted relatively high in quality. The tomato sauce was the forte. The tomatos tasted fresh and appetizing. They were full of Dolce Vita. 

But why only 4 star?  The issue was that I felt that the food was not quite worth the steep price. The pasta I could tell came right out of a box. Also, it would be nice if the dinner came with a side dish or something. My friend ordered the Fettucini Fellini only to describe it as good not great. So the food is not quite innovative or authentic. But if you are looking for a tasty enough Italian meal in a beautiful atmosphere where prompt service runs gracefully, La Dolce Vita fits the bill.",1
W07TY9cx2ZpDQyAn0ynMQg,"They used to have a really great ladies night (eery Tuesday) deal but the new deal is 30% off your bill which isn't as great. 

I would have been fine with it but I did not enjoy my food at all. I got the caprese salad and there was no balsamic vinegar which is what makes it for me. It was still fine though. I also had a pizza that had no flavor and I really didn't enjoy it. 

Perhaps the food is more authentic than I am used too/ like. It is also just very expensive for what you're getting. Next time will try another restaurant in Little Italy.",0
w1Dt_Dsbm40IgdVERLv5sQ,"Just another corner store in downtown Cleveland,,thought i was getting some authentic food,got some warmed up doughy chicken that looked uncooked,just left the casino at 5am and was very hungry, thought i was gonna get some great food",0
w1Dt_Dsbm40IgdVERLv5sQ,"They used to be a good authentic deli, now they cut costs and take advantage of people. I'll never eat here again. Ordered an extra pastrami sandwich because I was so hungry, walked back to my home, it was the wrong sandwich and two bites into this $15 sandwich I was so upset they gave the wrong sandwich so I took the 15 minute back walk because of principle. They admitted it was the wrong sandwich and offered to make me a new one. The second sandwich was smaller than the first one.  I complained and wanted to return it; was told they refuse a refund because they made two sandwiches , even though they were wrong. Will never support a business like this that treats loyal customers like this. All they do now is take advantage of drunk people at the casino, made their sandwiches half as big, and charge the same because people won't recognize. I was treated with such disrespect after wanting to a return a sandwich they openly admitted messing up. I really hope someone reading this that knows Jakes agrees they used to be a good deli but now they're basic and cutting costs. Taking advantage of people. I'll write as many negative emails as I can for weeks/months because of the disrespect tonight. It's about principle at this point, I didn't do anything wrong. The new guy making your sandwiches just sucks bring back the old guy and stop taking it out on your customers.",0
W1hXfgnugKfVV1wDhko5lw,One of the best kept secrets in Cleveland. You can sit on the tables outside and see the very location that started Cleveland. You can tell from the first step inside that it has been well visited through out Clevelands history. The food is really authentic to real Irish food. They also have a bus to downtown. The wait staff has usually always let our dogs sit outside with us which is great.,1
W1hXfgnugKfVV1wDhko5lw,"Had lunch yesterday with my 11 year old grandson while visiting Cleveland Aquarium ...everything ok but just that-ok Irish pub...I had southwest corn chowder that was spicy good but boring. Grandson had nachos, which has great cheese and average salsa.  I thought draft beer choices were limited for an Irish pub. I had the shephard' s pie. Ground lamb was bland, and topped with shredded cheese, so dish did not seem authentic, like we have had at the Pilot House in Kingston, ON.  Old brick building very cool, with outdoor seating.
Service was great.  Pricing fair.",1
w1rHHt72BON3K_C4caDDXw,"Tried this place based on Yelp reviews. Glad I did. The restaurant is in an old building and it smells old too BUT it is very clean. The service was good and everything seemed very authentic. Even the menu was in Spanish. The food was delicious and very reasonably priced. I especially liked the traditional drink, Horchata. I ate and was fully satisfied for $11.88.",1
w1rHHt72BON3K_C4caDDXw,"Yes I am a fan of this place! It's located right off of I-176 so it's easy to get to. The inside has the typical Central America restaurant decor with lively colors, landscape paintings, and birds. When I first walked in there was no one to greet me but a gentleman quickly showed up and we had a pleasant conversation about the menu. I went with a variety of pupusas at $2 each since that is what this place is known for. I also opted for the sweet plantains, refried beans, and homemade sour cream platter which came in at $6. (Prices are great here!)

Pupusas are like a stuffed pancake but made with masa - a corn dough. The garlic and cheese pupusa smells amazing and the Revuelta with pork, beans and cheese is the most popular pupusa, but they have other flavors with chicken, exotic flower, jalapeno, spinach or zucchini. The pupusas come with a simple but tasty cabbage slaw (no mayo base here) and a thin tomato sauce. They're about 5 inches in diameter and two are enough of a meal to fill you up; A simple tasty meal!

I found the fried plantains, refried beans, and homemade sour cream to all be pretty tasty as well. I can't stress enough how good simple authentic Salvadoran food is! I will definitely hit this place up again, probably on a Wednesday though since that's when they make their special sweet corn Atol.",1
w1rHHt72BON3K_C4caDDXw,"Amazing find!  Don't be scared to go in. Once you enter the beautiful wooden doors, you'll be surprised to see an eclectic Latin design. The menu was easy to read, and they have photos of every meal option.  Def recommend for good authentic food.",1
w1rHHt72BON3K_C4caDDXw,Great food! True authentic! We order for Togo or eat in at least once every week or two!,1
w1rHHt72BON3K_C4caDDXw,Looking for authentic El Salvadoran food come here. The Pupusas are the real deal. If you don't know what they are then you need come and see for yourself. Not fancy a joint but def worth a visit if you are in the Old Brooklyn area. Check it out!!,1
w1rHHt72BON3K_C4caDDXw,"Great hidden mom and pop shop in Old Brioklyn. Authentic Salvadoran food. I got the Papusas to go. Pork, chicken, and loroco. I was stuffed. Could have just eaten two. The cole slaw was medium heat and home made salsa. If you are looking for authentic Central American this is your spot. Small dining area if you want to eat in or get it to go.",1
w1rHHt72BON3K_C4caDDXw,"Have you ever wanted to sample the culinary attributes of a particular destination, but couldn't necessarily make the trip? Well, now you can and it won't cost you a round trip ticket! If you've never had El Salvadorean food, than you might want to branch out and try it. 

One telling sign that speaks to the authenticity of a restaurant is the presence of customers who would be knowledgable of that particular food. Needless to say, this place appears to be quite popular among Salvadoreans and other Central American living in the Cleveland area. 

For starters, I ordered Horchata, a Salvadorean variation of the Mexican beverage, but instead of rice, it's made with morro seeds and cinnamon - a smooth and refreshing take on traditional soft drinks! For my entree, I chose a pupusa (thick corn torilla with filling) with beans, cheese, garlic, and zucchini, and it arrived steaming hot! What a savory infusion of flavor that was highly satisfying. I will definitely be back for more! So, if you're in the mood for something different, check this place out!",1
w1rHHt72BON3K_C4caDDXw,"Probably my new favorite papuseria! I'm pretty sure it turns to a nightclub after hours but during the day you are transported to El Salvador and the authenticity is unmatched! The staff although their English is broken are beyond friendly and happy and just overall AWESOMEEEEEE! their pupasas are made to order as is their rice and other dishes, the menu is short and sweet and right to the point which makes ordering easy. It's in both English and Spanish which is super convenient. They serve alcohol and the typical jarritos sodas that pair well with their entrees. It's quiet and quaint in there, not too much seating but it looked like there was more room in the back from what I saw. Pricing is great you definitely do get a huge bang for your buck and you get a mini vacation while you dine. Nothing better than feeling home away from home and getting some uhmazinnnnggg papusa. And YES they are kid friendly!",1
w1rHHt72BON3K_C4caDDXw,"Decided to dine in for a change, and the service was excellent!

Be sure to check the specials, because some of the deals are really great. They've added pool tables in the back, so you can have your pupusas and get your game on.

The outside appearance of this place can be off-putting but don't let that deter you from coming here. Inside is quite quirky, but cute.

Definitely a fan of all of their pupusas and can't really say which is the best. 

Read other review that complained of the red sauce being thin, and well, that is how it is traditionally made. This place is 100% authentic.",1
w1rHHt72BON3K_C4caDDXw,"My boyfriend absolutely loves it here, and only had great things to say about it! I can see why! I've never had a pupusa before, and I was quickly addicted. Don't be intimated by the old brick exterior. The interior is welcoming and authentic, and the staff is excellent. The pupusas are served fresh and hot, and come with an amazing tomato sauce! Yum!",1
w1rHHt72BON3K_C4caDDXw,"This place is the real deal for authentic Salvadorian food. We came in with the intention of getting pupusas but the tacos looked so good. We ordered 3 chorizo tacos and they were amazing!  Some of the best chorizo I've ever had.  

The pupusas were wonderful as well. The only thing that was a little disappointing to me was the curtido (cabbage slaw for topping the pupusas). It was not as spicy and fresh as I've had at other places. Not that there was anything wrong with it, it just wasn't my favorite here, and I usually LOVE it. 

Service was great, the place also has its own parking lot so that is nice. They seem to have a nightlife scene as well, if that's your thing. 

I will definitely be back!",1
W97YBvhkOOel-HkBBfQbYw,"Wonderful authentic polish lunch buffet. The day we dined there they had stuffed cabbage, smoked and fresh kielbasa, roast chicken, cabbage and noodles, perogies, potato pancakes and whatever else the chef may surprise you with. Make sure to check out the ethnic smoked meats and bakery before you leave.",1
W97YBvhkOOel-HkBBfQbYw,"First: If you look on Google Maps for this restaurant, it will show its location on Fleet Ave. and say ""This place has closed or relocated."" That is not true.

Second: Come for the food, not the decor/atmosphere. If I were grading the decor, the score would be 2 stars. 

Third: The authentic Polish food is very good. Perogi, stuffed cabbage, mashed potatoes, soup,, kielbasa, potato pancake, all delicious. They are considered a deli also, but when I was there for lunch everyone was eating the buffet.",0
W97YBvhkOOel-HkBBfQbYw,"One of the most authentic Polish experiences outside of the home.

I've been dying to find a good Polish restaurant on my ""mid-west"" travels, and I heard Cleveland is known for its Polish community.  So, to the Slavic Village I went.  

I was greeted by a lovely lady with a thick Polish accent as soon as I walked in. She took me to the buffet and explained each dish.  My mouth started watering when she showed me the Golumpki (guamke)! This was a traditional dish my Grandma used to make. It was just as delicious as my Grandma's, even though it was of their own creation. 

I was going to sit by myself, as I was traveling solo, but just like traditional Polish folks do, they invite you to their table like it's some big feast. I was graciously welcomed by a couple of regular customers and indulged in amazing conversation. The table next to me was full of Polish talk. It reminded me of how we ate during my childhood at Grandma's house.

Later during my meal, I was surprised by the owner? a couple of extra dishes to go along with the buffet. She had given me home-made Italian wedding soup and home-made perogies - oh, wow - the best I've ever had!
These ""extra"" surprise dishes change up on an almost every-day basis.  Sometimes they have duck blood soup, borscht, pickle soup, etc.  

The front of store has many treats, candies, Polish soup/spice mixes, and other goodies you can take home with you - so be sure to check them out!

The inside and outside of the restaurant were traditionally decorated - even the restaurant sign was in Polish. 

This is a more low key restaurant - so, it's not typically too busy or too touristy. It's the real deal. I highly recommend Seven Roses and will be back!",1
W97YBvhkOOel-HkBBfQbYw,Paczki day and my co-workers are happy.  Love this family run business - authentic Polish experience in the heart of the Slavic Village,1
wAjTjCw2JsDbIn1HNgBQUA,Super awesome and authentic Italian deli style food.  The customer service is super!  If you get Dee helping you she will sure take care of you!  Better variety then what I see in San Francisco.  Only thing they need is panna cotta like Stella bakery in San Fran!,1
was-ZYQR2VKyyWrlkQnQWQ,"It's new favorite spot in town. It was fresh, authentic, and delicious. The toppings were unlimited. There was a protein. The prices were reasonable. The mango sticky rice was so good we got another one.",1
wbGOeoSttZguRXldqaiBVA,"Our party went for bunch on a Sunday around noon. This time worked great. Parking is limited and we were able to miss the Saturday afternoon rush. The food was excellent and came to the table in a decent time. Our group had chicken and waffles, French toast, and a stuffed french toast. All plates were clean and drinks were authentic and tasty. Our server had a bit of an attitude. She was nice to start but toward the end of the service was snippy and seemed inconvenienced. When asked did we need anything someone asked for another syrup and without saying anything she took a cup of open syrup from a table next to us (with people sitting at it!) and gave it to him. She also told us to make sure we said grace before eating. I'm a Christian but it was weird and inappropriate. She is the reason it wasn't 5 star rank. It put us off a bit but I think we will be back in the future. The food is worth it!",0
wbGOeoSttZguRXldqaiBVA,My wife and I really enjoy the food in the service. If you're looking for at authentic soul food this is the place to go! The fried chicken is amazing.,1
wbGOeoSttZguRXldqaiBVA,We went on a Thursday night. We arrived at 8:15. We opted to sit at the bar as opposed to waiting 30 minutes for a table. Although the restaurant was pretty crowded we had our food by 8:40. The bartender/server was very friendly and efficient. The service was good and the atmosphere is noisy but nice. The gravy on the pork chops was good but tasted pre made and not authentically smothered. Still very good!,1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"Delicious, authentic Cantonese food!  Their noodle and wonton soups are amazing!  They also have congee and bubble tea.  It's just like the food I had while in Hong Kong.  Most of their popular menu items are displayed with photos on the walls.  Just tell the server what number looks good and order it!

Some of my favorites are the salt baked squid, jade tofu, and Szechuan eggplant.  Prices are very reasonable and portions are quite large, so come with a group and enjoy! ^_^",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"I'll definitely have to re-visit for dinner, based on Yelp reviews.  I had lunch there and definitely was not blown away.   I went on a recent Friday afternoon, not crowded, but not empty either.  I was seated right away.   There was a little bit of a wait before someone came by to take my order.   I ordered the lunch portion of Szechuan Shrimp, which came with Fried Rice and an egg roll.  While waiting for my order, I noticed that everyone around me, had pots of hot tea, I flagged down my waitress and asked for tea, she seemed a little bit bothered, but brought it shortly thereafter.   My order arrived, pretty large portion for lunch.  The fried rice, was just that, no veggies, just brown tinted rice.  The eggroll was just ok, nothing extraordinary and a little bit dry.  The eggroll was accompanied by some type of fruit sauce (pineapple maybe), that was also, just ok.   The entree, where do I start?   The Szechuan Shrimp was absolutely drenched in a huge amount of what looked (and tasted) like hoisin sauce with a few red pepper flakes for heat.   The selection of vegetables was just ok, kinda looked like a hodge podge of whatever was laying around in the kitchen.   I walked away from my lunch very disappointed.   There was a direct view of the area behind the register (also where the drink dispenser was located), I could see supplies, garbage etc.  Also there was a big pool of water in front of the register, as I was checking out.   Needless to say, I REALLY wanted to like this place but it really missed the mark for me.   I will give it a another try, in order to try some of the more authentic cuisine, such as the salt-baked selections.  Just not sure that I will return soon:-(",0
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"Wonton gourmet is a frequent stop for me and my buddies (pretty much a small swarm of American-born Chinese students).  The food is cheap and tasty, and you can never go wrong with pointing at one of the many pictures along the walls and deciding you want to eat that dish.  Admittedly, the food is a bit on the oiler side, but it is quite good for the price.  It's hard to name which dishes would be our favorites, although often we will get a mixture of some of the following:  the salt and pepper pork/seafood/shrimp, the eggplant dishes, various seafood dishes, and mapo dofu.  The congee is also tasty whenever you're in the mood for it.  Overall, it's a good place to get cheap authentic Chinese food in the Cleveland area.",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"They dish up great HK style street food. Fantastic noodle soups. The dumpling soup is one of my faves here.   My type of comfort food.

Their HK milk tea (hot and cold) is fantastically delicious, like what you would expect to get in Hong Kong. I had the pleasure of speaking with the owner the last time few times I was there, he actually imports the tea leaves from HK to ensure the authentic taste!  It is actually a mix of 2-3 types of tea leaves.  So if you order HK milk tea elsewhere and you a given a cup with a lipton label hanging out the side, sorry, that's not the real deal...",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"I wish I could be here right now.  Huge portions of authentic Chinese food (or as Americanized as you want) with friendly service and rock-bottom prices.  While we were a bit overwhelmed with the number of choices available, everything we tried was absolutely delicious and we left stuffed and happy :).",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"Possibly Cleveland's best offering in the Chinese category, Wonton Gourmet is a must visit if you are looking for authentic chinese cuisine with a wide range of choices.  Tung Choy with Garlic is one of the most flavorful greens dishes ever and the Cumin Beef and Mao Pao Tufo are all my favorites.  Also, the Salted Bake options are unique.  Be advised many of the Shrimp dishes come WITH the shells on and while I know it is customary for many countries to eat the shells...I just can't get past it!

No, it isn't fancy dining and won't Wow you with ambience...however...the food makes me grateful this restaurant is part of our amazing food scene in Cleveland!",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"MMMmmm!! This is probably my favorite Chinese restaurant in Cleveland. I liked it more than Siam Cafe, which I've been to a few times and wasn't wowed. I went with a large group and we tried a number of dishes and ate family style.  We had the Orange beef, Singapore noodles, eggplant with shredded pork in pan-fried noodles, and seafood with fish maw soup, Jade tofu+fish, iced milk tea. EVERYTHING was delicious! (I probably would pass on the Jade tofu and iced milk next time, though..there still isn't a fantastic bubble tea place in Cleveland. Koko is where i go for my bubble tea fix, but it's nothing compared to Tenren's in NYC or Joy Yee's in Chicago)All of us in our group of 10 was satisfied with yummies in our tummies.

It's authentic Chinese food. You know the Asian food will be good when most of the patrons are Asian and the waitstaff can't speak English. That's just how it is here in the Midwest with first/second generation Asian-Americans.

It was soo cheap, too! Less than $12/person and we ate our hearts out!  So much more satisfying than going to a gourmet restaurant. I was just at Lolita's last night, which was good, but not as good as this place. I'd rather eat this type of homecooking than spend thrice as much with a bunch of yuppies and rich ppl.

I'll definitely be coming here on a regular basis! :) YOU WILL LOVE IT, TOO! I promise! Warning: You will be outnumbered if you're white. ;)

Oh yeah, the waitstaff is kind of blah, though. She kept on asking us if we had a coupon, and I said, ""Oh no, but I wish we did!"" Then she said, ""Well we don't take coupon!"" And I looked at her confused, like ""Ummm..okay, so you want us to leave then?"" Lol.  But it's just a language barrier. I guess there was some sorta scam from restaurant.com, and they don't take the coupon they put out, FYI, if you have one.",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"Stopped by while visiting from Michigan and saw this place had good reviews. First thing js I'm glad the restaurant had a parking lot as I was afraid we'd have to street park. 

Walking into the restaurant it seemed like this was THE place to go for authentic Chinese food as the place was packed and everybody seemed pretty ""fobby"". We got a table pretty quickly though.

I ordered the typical BBQ pork over rice, wife ordered #23 three flavored shrimp noodle, and we added a salty fish fried rice as well. BBQ pork over rice was only average, pork was a little too lean and the rice was dry and clumpy, the BBQ sauce was good tho. Wife's noodles were also only average but the dumplings had good flavor. I would say the salty fish fried rice was the best of the dishes and probably because it was the most authentic. 

Service was good and quick. 

If this were California I'd give it 3 stars, but for being in Ohio it deserves 4 stars. Good enough for the Midwest!",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"Probably the restaurant I've been MOST often in all of Cleveland, period. Go with a big group and share everything so you can try all the amazing food, leave stuffed with leftovers, and be shocked... SHOCKED.. by the amazing prices, usually less than $12-15 per person after tip without holding back on ordering, at all.  

YUM.  This is better than Szechuan and their good, but one note flavor and over salty everything, and is not quite as good, but significantly cheaper than Siam down the street.  Those are my 3 spots for authentic Chinese food, and Wonton is easily the best balance of taste and price. 

I mean, if you are coming from china or a giant city like LA, Chicago, or NYC, this probably won't impress you, but for Cleveland, its the go to for Chinese fair.",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"In Cleveland by far one of the best Chinese places that I have been to. The teas are real no tea bags, food is authentic and delicious. Wait staff very friendly unlike you get in most places like this. Hole in the wall no ambience but great food. Don't miss it",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"Finally I was able to check out this place since moving to Cleveland from California for 1 month...I had a shrimp wonton watercress with noodle and my bro had duck wonton noodle. We also ordered a young chow (house special) fried rice and shrimp rice roll. I would say the noodle itself is not that special and the soup base is just typical. However I liked the wonton that my bro had better because it had a sesame flavor in there (just my opinion). My wonton mixed with watercress was alright. The fried rice was good but not great....good because it's not oily although they used spam in there...not too authentic...it should be chinese sausage instead....The shrimp rice roll had a nice medium soft texture and freshly made...It was great....The overall experience there was actually awesome, speaking of a Chinese restaurant in Cleveland...I'd definitely come back soon this weekend to check out their other dishes....BTW, their prices are not bad at all as well as their services.",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"First time I went it was delicious. But maybe that's because my parents ordered the food and know how to order authentic chinese. We got the cirspy shrimp which was delicious, along with a tofu dish, spicy fish, etc. All was very good. Second time I went I got the duck dinner, not as good. The duck was old and over-fried. Last time I went I ordered a ma po tofu with pork and they cooked the vegetarian mapo tofu, which had huge chunks of ginger in it and was not good. I'll still go back though, probably the best authentic chinese around.",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"oh wonton gourmet
a happy ending indeed
pleasure of the mouth

I'll be damned if this joint can't hang with any real Chinese places anywhere.  In our fair city there are loads of American Chinese craptastic places, buffets, which range from gross to wretched, but this place is the real deal. No General Tso's chicken scraps, no sweet and sour dog food, but a myriad of authentic and flavorful dishes. 

The cumin lamb was a hot and spicy treat that packed a wallop, but was not some test of manhood to eat. You could taste a lot more than the peppers. The chive dumplings were homemade and the filling was very flavorful.  Szechwan beef was wonderfully nuanced. Sesame chicken -best I ever tasted.

The ubiquitous flat screen showed a Chinese flick. Interestingly, the sound was on and the movie was not dubbed, but it had Chinese subtitles as well. 
Double happiness?

Carry on...",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"My girlfriend and her family love this place. I am a convert! This is traditionally considered Hong Kong style comfort food. The Hong Kong diner food is mostly concentrated on the little yellow menu, so that's where I order from most of the time.

As I said, it's comfort food, and I feel very comforted whenever I go. It's nothing like the Americanized Chinese food I grew up with. They serve a few things most Americans probably won't eat--like crispy fried pork intestine, which I still have not developed the courage to try--but on the whole it's just a much more authentic, fresh, and non-artificial tasting Chinese food experience. 

It seems like everything is amazing, but I particularly love the rice porridge (with Chinese donuts), the ningo, and the pan fried noodles. 

Oh... and the turnip cakes.

Oh, don't forget the pot stickers.

and the rice rolls. Oh my gosh, I could go on and on.

What's funny is that they have a couple of servers who don't speak any English or Cantonese (only Mandarin) so even though I'm there with a bunch of Chinese people they're still using sign-language to communicate with the waiter. 

One more thing. It helps if you know that friendly service is not really a Chinese concept. It's more like, we give you food, you give us money, then you leave. I like the matter-of-fact and honest nature of that transaction. That said, I think the service is pretty decent, they get the food out quickly most of the time. We waited a long time once, but that never happened again.

I had better stop. I feel like I'm in danger of writing the great American novel here. I could go on and on, but the truth is, you have to try it! Go in, eat, enjoy. Don't forget: yellow menu.",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"Love this place! Congee is delish and the food is extremely good, tasty and full of flavor. My only complaint, I wish they were open 24/7 lol, otherwise its awesome! You want authentic and good Chinese, go here!",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,I just want to say I stopped eating Chinese take out and I hate when an ethnic group changes their cusine to suit Americans . This restaurant is pretty authentic I stopped and had carry out the Szechuan Chicken and Wonton soup it tasted like the real deal it was nice and spicy .I couls taste the asian spices and the Authenticity of the dish which is the whole purpose. The menu is huge alot of these dishes Ive never ate like the soup with fish in it etc. Check it out if you want the real deal I will be back.,1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"Best authentic chinese food I have come across. I have come to Cleveland mutiple times just to come to this restaurant and eat their shrimp wonton soup. I'm from Detroit, so its about a 3 and a half hour drive, but it is so worth the drive. The food here is so good. My favorite dish is the chicken hot pot. I highly recommend this place and I will definitely be coming back here.",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"Good stuff!  We tried this place out after reading reviews on yelp!  Actually, it was the pictures of the different dishes on yelp! that did it. First of all, please don't judge this place by its location or how it looks from the outside (or inside for that matter).  As we were walking in, there were folks coming out with carry out. The first thing I noticed was all of the Asian patrons. I think that is a good indication of the authenticity of the cuisine. The second thing that I noticed was all of the numbered pictures on the wall corresponding to some of the menu items. Thank God for those because I have to say the number of choices, on three different menus, is ""overwhelming"" (in my wife's words). Yes, three different menus....we didn't really use any of them and used the pictures instead. 

Here's what we ordered:
Tea; Shrimp wonton soup; XO Seafood Fried Rice; Beef Chow Fun. 

Our food literally came out within 5-minutes and the portion sizes were humongous.  The fried rice was probably the best I've had and the beef chow fun was on point. The soup was my least favorite, but I imagine if I was really in the mood for soup I may have enjoyed it more. The shrimp stuffed inside the wontons were a nice size. 

Overall, I felt like I was in an authentic Chinese restaurant with the background noise filled with Chinese patrons speaking their native language and a Chinese news broadcast on the television. I can't wait to come back to try some of the other dishes on the menu, ahem, I mean the wall.",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,This place is nothing special the food was over oiled and absolutely flavorless. The 3 dumpling soup these other folks are ravening about smelled like a barn and was virtually tasteless. Even the tea was completely flavorless. You want authentic your much better off at Li Wah down the street.,0
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"Bam I'm in China.  I was just in Cleveland like 3 steps ago.  I actually cannot comment on the food authenticity, but I can tell you it was good.  The best pot stickers I have ever had.  The thing that makes this place worth a trip is the variety.  I am so tired of going to a Thai place or Chinese place and having the same menu items as the Asian food at some grocery stores.  Wonton has different selections, and don't worry about not know what you are getting.  Just point to the picture of it on the wall, and it will be swiftly brought out.

The only bad part is the cramp dining setup.  Enjoy Asian food with the joys of over population.  

I would say Wontons is a must at least once.",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,Awesome Chinese food. This restaurant is actually run and the food prepared authentically. The service is good and fast. The portions are large and inexpensive. Very kid friendly. Highly recommended.,1

wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"I am slightly ashamed that I eat the food here often enough that the staff recognize me not only in person, but my voice over the phone when I order food for pick-up. This place is an amazing value and you get an unreasonably large amount of food for the price. They do use MSG, but you can ask them not to add it. Some of my personal favorites are:

Salt and Pepper Pork Chop: Definitely not for those on a diet, but it tastes so good that it does not stop me from ordering it nearly every time I come here. This dish goes especially well with the accompanying guilt. Not too much breading, plenty of meat, and seasoned appropriately. I have tried this dish at numerous Chinese restaurants, and this actually stands out as one of the better ones. It will be overly fried on a rare occasion.

Fish/Beef in Chili Oil: Just when you thought the typical entrÁE©e here was large, this one is even larger. As expected, given that the dish is immersed in chili oil, it will be fairly salty and spicy, and tastes best with a good amount of rice. This alone feeds me for 3 or 4 meals - and I can eat A LOT.

Beef with Bitter gourd: Not much to say here, tastes exactly as it should.

Beef Chow Fun: Also an unusually large amount of food.

Fish with Seasonal Vegetables: The fish is breaded, but not overly so, and also tastes pretty good. One side benefit of this dish is that the vegetables provides the illusion of a healthy, well-balanced meal.

Overall, this place i",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"Wonton Gourmet & BBQ is a gem in Cleveland.  Granted it isn't located in the best area, but don't let it's location fool you.  Some of the best eats are located in shady places.  

Their portions are huge and everything is priced right.  Think family-style dining.  They have a more authentic menu for those of us wanting AUTHENTIC Chinese food and they also have an Americanized menu for those with more western palettes.  They have pictures of their dishes along the walls of the restaurants.  

The restaurant is small and can get crowded, but it's always a good sign to see a Chinese restaurant packed full of Chinese people...and gwai lo!  The restaurant itself is super clean, service is friendly and they do speak English, which is a plus.",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,Really tasty food. Very authentic! By far the best dry chili chicken we have ever had. The chicken was seasoned perfectly. Everything else was flavorful as well. The only downside would be slow inconsistent service. But it's not terrible. Will be back again some time.,1

If you are near downtown and want to find an authentic spot in Chinatown, don't pass this place up!",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"I have been to Wonton Gourmet twice, and I really enjoyed the food both times. I've had the roasted duck noodle and wonton soup, the braised tender short ribs in black bean sauce, and the iced HK milk tea. The duck soup is really good, as are the ribs. My only complaint would be that the ribs, which are listed as tender, are actually quite chewy. I personally don't mind, but it might be misleading for some. The flavors are wonderful though. The menu is lengthy, with some 250+ options ranging from familiar dishes to some really authentic ones. I think everyone who likes Chinese food will find something they like here.",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"The quality and taste of the food was excellent! My mom and I had the Beef Chow Fun, Twice Cooked Pork & Malaysian style Tung Choy. All had a great distinctive aroma. Possibly the BEST authentic Chinese food in the Cleveland area!",1

wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"One of the best, most authentic Chinese restaurants near downtown Cleveland. My family and I frequent this place to dine in, order take-out--consistently solid.",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"The food here is the best in Cleveland, in my humble opinion, for authentic Chinese.  We order here frequently to go, and have dined in a few times.  The Salted Baked Pork Chop is fried deliciousness.  I would eat the bones if I could, and I am not one of those people who like to eat fat, but seriously these pork chops are picked CLEAN.  It helps that it is crispy and well cooked.  Our kids LOVE the beef with Chinese broccoli.  Lots of flavor, but the sauce is actually surprisingly light.  Tons of veggies make this a dinner out option you don't need to feel guilty giving the kids.  Chive potsickers...OMG...little salty bursts of onion and pork in homemade noodle, awesome.

Other options I've had that I enjoyed, but may be an acquired taste, are the spicy fish (super spicy, yum!! Not the hubbys fav tho!), calamari with black bean sauce (calamari in very long tubes, I wasn't a huge fan of the chewiness, but still good), and the hot and spicy beef noodle soup (soup flavor was great, but on the oily side, and HUGE pieces of brisket, but me being me I had to trim the fat down on these).

You may ask why 4 stars?  Well, this is in Asia town and has a very strong Asian clientele, which is never a bad thing!  However not speaking the language puts a bit more ""distance"" between yourself and the staff, and we have definitely felt the service at times was a bit indifferent.  Not rude, not bad, but you know when you say a joke or smile and it just crashes against the brick wall that is your server? Yes, that.  But don't let that stop you from being adventurous and relying on the pictures on the wall if you need help ;)",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"Our family usually always come here for family dinner or sometimes just a quick lunch . The food is very authentic and you don't have to wait that long.

I chose some of the Hong Kong (authentic Chinese) fare such as the Fried Turnip Cakes and all Flavors Shrimp Wonton Soup  for an appetizer; my two guests played it safe stuffed wonton. All were good but fried turnips is an acquired taste..had a ting of a fish taste. We ordered three entrees to share; Chicken Chop Suey, , Szechuan Shrimp (spicy) and me the Seafood Pot...all were exquisite! They almost ruined my night by adding an $8.67 for a group of three folk...it almost seemed like that stereotype thing; that we black folk don't tip. normally tip at about 20% so the waitress cheated herself out of about $4.00 tip of a $57.00 bill. I also tip with cash! Ha Ha! Despite that slight I will definitely go back again!",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"First rule of a good Chinese restaurant: 
There must be chinese customers.
Second Rule of a good chinese restaurant:
The chinese in the restaurant must be eating (not just waiting on tables) and speaking in languages you (presumably average Americans) don't understand.
Third Rule of a good Chinese restaurant:
No fortune cookies!

Thus I arrive at Wonton Gourmet and BBQ with my usual dose of skepticism. Though there were no Roast Duck or Char Siew hanging near the window, I was instantly transported to my happy place when I walked in.

Plastered on the walls were photos of the food they serve, including dishes, I've not seen since I stepped on the plane in Asia to return to the US. The menu is extensive. It's a mainly cantonese cuisine type of place. So a lot of items with roots from Hong Kong. Such as Wonton soup with egg noodles, Beef Chow HoFun (and yes Ho is fun VERY fun).

The wonton soup with egg noodle is VERY authentic. The dumpling is filled with meats and not wrap. The veggie amount is the same as any you would get while dining in Asia. There were five wontons and the clear soup is as real and tasty as any in Hong Kong, Singapore or China(s). 

The House Pot Stickers are good. Presumably, these dumplings are a house recipe. The dipping sauce is somewhat Americanized but taste good. The Pot Stickers sauce I'm used to is just black vinegar and ginger.

The Beef Chow HoFun....well, yum! It's a standard item in Cantonese eateries all over Asia and it's nice to find one so similar. I've always like my food hot (spicy hot!) so I add the table hot sauce to it....and it just doesn't get anymore authentic then this.

The tea is a MUST TRY!  Hot or cold, basically it's your regular black tea made real strong with a healthy dose of evaporated milk to taste. If you are having the tea hot, don't forget to add sugar (available on the table) to your liking (I didn't see artificial sweeteners and didn't bother to ask)

The wait staff is a pleasant crew and spoke decent English. They accommodated my children and were helpful when asked.

If you are looking for an authentic chinese dining experience, look no further! Because at the end of your meal, you get only the check. NO fortune cookies!! 





Though my 3  year-old did ask ""where's the cookie?"" OMG what have I done to my kids?!",1

Potstickers- so flavorful with great texture, So much more I wanted to try, but portions are huge!",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"Don't be fooled by its small footprint. This is a high high quality Chinese restaurant. It is very very clean inside, top class compared to most Chinese restaurant type, definitely the top one in Cleveland.

The food is not just authentic, it is very good. It is comparable to the very good ones in San Francisco. The price is reasonable too because they provide all kind of small dishes. I do feel that if you count the price per pound, it is more expensive than most in Cleveland area. In my opinion, it totally worth it.",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"PROS: Cheap, authentic Cantonese-style Chinese food. Excellent soup wontons: any of their wonton egg-noodle soups is a must. Friendly, English-fluent service as well.
CONS: The service was a little lackadaisical about following-up after all the orders were delivered. But you'll rarely need anything more once you're with the victuals.
AMBIANCE: minimal decor but clean; hole-in-the-wall feel. In the ghetto but it can't be helped--all of Cleveland's Asiatown is in the ghetto, unfurtunately--but it's not too bad in the day. It's on a high-traffic street, next to a bustling supermarket (Dave's Market) and across from a Chinese Christian church.

The moment I stepped in the front door, past the giant Chinese characters pasted on the window, I had to suppress the urge to bear hug everyone in sight. Once we were seated, my eyes on the large-scale photos of dishes lining the walls, I was doing cartwheels in my head. And when our orders came, it was hard to enjoy the first few bites because a) having mouthgasms while eating is very difficult to do at the same time and b) I was trying very hard not to cry tears of utter joy.

Before you jump to the conclusion that I'm completely off my rocker, and if you've made it this far, let me explain. When I first decided to move to Cleveland about seven months ago, I accepted my fate: there wasn't going to be any good, authentic Asian food, and I thought I could live with that. I'll just have to learn to make what I usually order in restaurants, I said. So imagine my astonishment when I found something so close to what I grew up on, weekends in LA's Chinatown, Monterey Park, Alhambra, Arcadia, etc. Walking into Wonton Gourmet & BBQ was like going home for a little while, except without having to take a $400 flight. And it came just at the right time: I was really starting to fiend for some real Hong Kong-style grub.

Using the predominantly Los Angeles-based Sam Woo Restaurant & BBQ and Golden City Seafood Restaurant chains as my standard for Cantonese comfort food--and maybe purists snobbier than I am will quibble but I'm just establishing my own gauge here--Wonton Gourmet and BBQ holds up pretty well. We ordered wonton noodle soups, shredded beef hor fun , yang chou fried rice, scallion pancakes and potstickers. The portions were huge--there was only three of us and we'd obviously went overboard on the ordering--but we were all too excited to resist indulging ourselves.  

The wonton noodle soups were solidly crafted, and since I thought they were the highlight of my meal--and the one item I'll be going back for--allow me to break it down:
(1) NOODLES: they included a larger helping of thin egg noodles than I'm usually used to--I took it as a good thing--who doesn't want more bang for their buck?--but my friend complained he felt the extra helping of noodles tasted a little bland and needed to be more salted or seasoned. Which leads me to believe the usually skimpier helping of noodles I'm used to may have been more than an economic choice: the higher soup-to-pasta ratio may have allowed more absorption of the adequately seasoned soup into the noodles. Just a theory.
(2) VEGGIES: they used yu choy instead of the customary blander bok choy or Chinese broccoli--big bonus points for me, since it's my favorite Chinese green but also tends to be shunned by Chinese restaurants catering towards American appetites.
(3) WONTONS: top-notch. The pasta wrapper was cooked to silky perfection--not hard, not too thin, but not mushy--the only time I've had soup wontons that texture were in Singapore on  Haig Road, at a long-established open-air food stall that made ONLY shrimp wonton noodle soup. The stuffing--a blend of minced shrimp and pork--was generous as well. With a small dollop of chili flakes in oil--a spoonful of heavenly comfort.  
(4) MEAT: my friends loved the pork char siew; my roast duck was passable, mostly bones with very little meat and more salty than sweet. They must put less sugar in their marinades.

Everything else was delicious but also less salted than I'm used to. The yang chou fried rice was fluffy and not overly greasy. The hor fun noodles were a bit overcooked and the sauce a little less sweet than I'm used to--perhaps they didn't mix in enough hoisin sauce. The potstickers were delicately executed, crisped without being charred, and came with the customary vinegar and soy sauce for dipping--definitely an appetizer I'd recommend. And finally, the scallion pancakes were a star hit, done in the round, flat potato-pancake-like style: thin, fried-dough-embedded-with-scallions-goodness, crisp around the edges.  A warning: one order comes with only four slices and one person can easily take down two, so two orders might actually be better for more than two people.

Was this review way too long and biased by my year-long HK food deprivation? Undoubtedly yes. But do I still urge the Cleveland populace to frequent this fine establishment? Yes, yes, most feverishly so!",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"Heard from an inside source (okay, just a fellow fan who's been dining there longer) that the chef there can cook both authentic Hong Kong-style Cantonese dishes not even included on the menu (e.g. San Mian Huang--crispy noodles with gravy and shreded meat on top so that you get both a soft and crunchy textures!) AND spicy Hunan dishes.  Note to self (and all you reading this): try the water-boiled fish or chicken, in spicy Hunan style.  It's supposed to be truly sizzling and aromatic.",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"SF Bay Area native here, home of the most delicious and culturally diverse foods! I'm very picky when it comes to Asian cuisine, specifically Chinese food, Japanese food, and Vietnamese food. One trend that I am aware of (and dislike) is that many Asian restaurants dilute the quality of the ""authentic"" Asian cuisine, often ""Americanizing"" it for the American palate. 

With that being said, this is my fourth Chinese restaurant in the Northeastern Cleveland area, and this by far tops them all. It's a small hole in the wall type of joint, mom & pop shop owned, but they have a big parking lot that is under video camera surveillance. 

They serve your typical Americanized Chinese dishes (orange chicken, General Tsao chicken, etc.), but they also serve authentic Chinese dishes. Been here three times already, and each time I order the Jade Tofu dish, hands down THE BEST tofu dish I have ever eaten! I'm not usually a tofu-dish type of person, but they use an egg-tofu in the dish which gives you a silkier, melt-in-your-mouth tofu taste that is absolutely out of this world delicious! It is typically served with bite size pieces of fried fish, but you can ask them to skip the frying and soft-cook the fish instead.

This is my top pick for Chinese restaurants in the Northeastern Ohio area.

Note: This review is my opinion based on my experience only and may not reflect on the business as a whole. What experience I had may not be the same for someone else.",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"I went to this restaurant because I craved some authentic chinese food.  Even though I'm not Cantonese,  my parents have lived there for awhile so my meals consisted of Cantonese food. Being in the restaurant made me nostalgic.  
Anyway, back to the food, we got mo po tofu, beef chow fun and some pancakes. Everything was really good. The tofu had the perfect spice. The only thing I regret was not inviting more people so I could order more food. I want to try their bbq pork chops, wonton noodle soup, and their milk tea next time. Can't wait to go back",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"Seriously. Best. Chinese. Ever.

My boyfriend decided he wanted Chinese food today and I wasn't really feeling it. Gosh, am I glad I got hungry and didn't have any other suggestions because this changed me. For real. 

We decided to each get a soup and then get something else to split. I had the shrimp wonton soup with noodles. Fantastic. The broth wasn't hot salt water; it actually tasted like broth. Delicious, satisfying broth. This is the kind of dish that I'll crave. You know when you just remember a flavor and you know when you want that certain food, it's supposed to be that way? This wonton soup is most definitely going to be that kind of dish for me. Next time I want some wonton soup, it will be that soup that I'm wanting. 

The other dish we had was the beef and broccoli. I don't normally eat beef when I get Chinese food, but I'm (once again) glad I let someone else make this decision because it definitely wasn't a bad one! The beef was tender and the brown sauce, to quote my boyfriend, was surprisingly NOT sugary. It had full flavor, less sugar, and I actually didn't leave here regretting the amount of food that I had. I didn't feel like going into a food coma from the heaviness of the food and sugars/oils used. 

Finishing touch: really tasty orange slices. I don't even like oranges and I enjoyed these. 

Bottom line: flavorful and authentic.",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"Fantastic, authentic Chinese!  LOVE!  The Turnip Cakes...A...Mazing!",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"This is definently a case against judging a book by it's cover. Wonton Gourmet could be mistaken as an ordinary Chinese restaurant in a strip mall, but it is so much more. The second you step through the door the tantalizing smell of authentic Chinese food will hit you. Once seated there is hot green tea waiting for you at the table. Across the walls are pictures of every item on the menu, luckily we were eating with regulars who knew all the best dishes. We had hot and spicy fish, salt bake pork chops, chili chicken, cumin lamb, shrimp wonton soup, and a type of cabbage with a taste similar to bok choy. Everything was delicious, but the cumin lamb, and the hot and spicy fish were especially superb. Both dishes were prepared with finesse and the deep spicy flavor in each one was perfectly balanced with the other flavors. The fish was so tender it melted in my mouth, and the lamb was executed with perfection. This is the best Chinese food I have ever had in my life, you will be missing out without taking a trip to Wonton Gourmet.",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"This place is my favorite Chinese restaurant in all of Northeast Ohio! It's seriously authentic! My favorite items: the wonton noodle soup and their steamed oysters! I've also tried their clay pots, and those are great too! We need more places like this in Cleveland!",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,Pretty good authentic Chinese food . My favorite is spicy fish and spicy beef. Service is ok. But the inside needs some remodeling...,1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"I wanted to try the Jellyfish and there may, or may not be a next time. It was not bad food, but when my friend said people were comparing it to the most authentic HK in Cle, I didn't taste that in the place. 

The quantity was on point I have to say that. I may go back at a time when I'm really hungry. You know the time when you might just pull into McDonalds if you happen to pass one, you all know what I'm talking about! Prices were on point also. 

My dumpling soup was pretty darn good, but the chicken I ordered was a little spicy with no warning of it. Was not a fan of that. I think that is actually the only negative about the place. This is a positive review people, I myself just realized this. I am now staring at 3 stars and am moving it up to 4. Check this place out!!",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"Until recently, it's been a couple years since I've dined here. The food quality seem to have degraded after new ownership a few years ago, but now, it has redeemed itself! 

I dined here twice in one week because it was just that good! The last two dinners were excellent. In the two trips, I had the cold spicy beef tendons, beef tripe, salted fish fried rice, fish filet w/ jade tofu, and several of its noodle dishes. The quality and taste is now what I've remembered. We really liked the salted fish fried rice. Great flavors from the salted fish and is very light on soy since the fish is enough to season the rice. The other dishes were also very tasty. The cold cut tendons were a great appetizer during and prior to the meal.

Definitely worth a visit if you are into authentic Chinese. Be sure to use the pictures on the wall to help you decide!",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"Highly recommend this place. The food is very authentic and everything is always so good. We ordered chili chicken, deep fried sole, salt pork, salt squid, beef chow hofun, Szechwan beef, fried rice, orange chicken, and a veggie dish ever thin was better then the next.",1

Although it wasn't listed as spicy, it definitely had some zing. The shrimp and broccoli had lots of nice fresh vegetables.  A large side of rice accompanied our meals. The pot stickers were average, but the egg roll was great. My only wish is that they would offer a sampler platter so you could try a little bit of everything.  I would love to try jellyfish and other more exotic listings, but I  don't know that I  could eat a whole plate full.",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"Ordered wonton noodle soup with the three different types of dumplings. Meh...not bad, not amazing. I guess something in between. We tried some other dishes: taro, fried dumplings, duck wonton soup which were all just okay. This place was pretty bumpin on a Saturday, we had to wait for a table for about 10 minutes. 

Maybe we ordered the wrong things because it certainly had an authentic feel. I'm tempted to go back and try it again before give this a completely mediocre review.",0
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"Wonton Gourmet is one of the more authentic Chinese restaurants in Cleveland, and the majority Asian clientele would seem to agree. It's a rather small restaurant, with an austere ambiance. There are probably 20 or so tables, mostly 2 and 4-tops, but there are a few larger round tables that can sit 6-10 people.

They have two menus: one for the non-Asians with most of the ""typical"" American-Chinese dishes like sweet and sour shrimp, General Tso's chicken, and eggrolls; and one that is all written in Chinese, which includes items most of us white folk wouldn't know about, and that might push some of our limits for what we feel comfortable eating, like frog, pig intestine, or beef tendon. Please note, my previous statement is not a judgement of Chinese food, but more of a remark on the somewhat limited palate of the ""average"" American.  I feel I should note that I happen to like beef tendon.

I would recommend avoiding the more typical American-Chinese dishes. You can find those in any Chinese restaurant in Ohio, and Wonton Gourmet doesn't do anything special with them.  If you can read Chinese, or find a friend who does, try exploring the ""real"" menu.

We go here once or twice a month, and I'm fortunate that my partner reads Chinese, so we have access to both menus. This is helpful, because although they have a lot of their menu spread out across the walls of the restaurant with color photos of the dishes, it's hard to know what's in many of them, beyond their names.  For example, ""Hong Kong style noodle soup,"" doesn't provide much insight, other than the fact it's a noodle soup that is typical of the former UK colony.

I have had a few mediocre dishes there. I happen to feel that the HK Style soup is bland and not worth the calories. I also had a beef and vegetable low mein that was flavorless. But for the most part, I have enjoyed their food. They have a great beef and tendon stew in a clay pot, a deliciously rich bamboo and mushroom sautee, a wonderfully crispy wok-fried chow mein, and many others.

Don't expect to be bowled over by ambiance, customer service or presentation, but overall, if you're interested in exploring authentic regional Chinese cuisine, you'll probably have a good time.  You should also be aware that it gets very busy for brunch/lunch on the weekends - they serve some traditional Chinese breakfast foods, not typical brunch fare that you'll find at an American restaurant - so if you go between 10:30A and 1P, there could be a wait.",0
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"The restaurant is about 1/2 mile from downtown and they are opened everyday at 11am except on Tuesdays - closed on Tuesdays.  I'll have to give them 3.5 stars for now... I wasn't blown away by the establishment... two things going for them, the price and late hours.

I got there as they opened, got seated and reviewed the menu... they do have lot of pictures on the wall, but I decided to stick with the menu and check out what they had... yes, they do have two menus - one is for Americanized Chinese food and the other is for more authenticate food from the mainland.

I ordered the shrimp wonton soup with egg noodle and eggplant with shredded pork over rice.  Now, I had no idea what over rice meant, granted I did find out when the food arrived... but as a first timer, I was clueless... basically, the dish is served on a one plate, 1/2 is the rice, the other 1/2 is the dish, of which some are over the rice - hence, 'over the rice' menu dishes!

I got my eggplant first and it was good, I added the hot chili oil and it gave the extra kick to the dish... the shrimp wonton soup with egg noodle... well, it was very blend, so I had to add more salt and black pepper to give it a taste... but nonetheless, on a rainy day, it was very nice to have a warm noodle soup!  So for both dishes, my total price with tax was like $12.50, very cheap and their price is very reasonable!

As for the service, it was quick, but when I was there, there was only one waitress... and even though she knew I didn't speak Chinese, she kept it up :)  also, along with English... not sure why.... 

I would recommend you give this place a try and judge it for yourself... they are opened until midnight, so if you are craving for some Chinese food, swing on by for a byte!",0
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"Good solid authentic whole-in-the-wall Chinese food.

I've been here twice now: once for a quick bowl of noodles for lunch alone, and once for a meal with a group of friends.  The food was fine both times.  The service is quick and efficient, there's nice pictures on the wall if you don't know what you want.  The shrimp dumpling noodles were very good.  And it really is authentic Chinese food -- the kind of food I might find myself eating with my Chinese bf's family.

That being said, it didn't blow my mind or anything.  I've had better.  I can see myself going back based on convenience, location, etc.  But then again, I wouldn't miss it if I don't...

wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"Growing up on the east side of Cleveland, we frequently would head over to the restaurant in which was before Wonton Gourmet came around. Despite the limited tables and seats, the support system of Wonton Gourmet's customers is bigger than one can image! My family and I came downtown on a Saturday evening and the amount of people dining in and ordering takeout, during our dinner there was quite surprising. 

One of my favorite dishes as a kid and even as an adult is the Bejing Pork Chop. The sweet and savory red sauce of the pork chop pairs so well over white rice. In good ol' Chinese fashion, this family style restaurant allows you to share all the delicious goodness. With four adults, we ordered a soup and 3 main dishes to share. Needless to say, it was the perfect amount of food, without having to bring leftovers home! Highly recommend Wonton Gourment for authentic Chinese food and great service!",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"The boy and I spent 3 days in Cleveland for a business trip, and every night we would stop by here to get take out to bring back to our hotel room.  Close to authentic Cantonese style food; we thoroughly enjoyed every dish we had but the Jade Tofu with Fish Fillet stands out the most.  Their Hong Kong style milk tea and lemon tea are definitely worth trying too.  

I really love how generous they are with their portions, this restaurant really has amazing value for how much food they give you.  Most Cantonese restaurants I have been to usually offer subpar service, but not this place.  Their staff are very friendly and attentive.  

The outside of the restaurant might not look like much, but if you're craving for some good Chinese food, Wonton Gourmet & BBQ is worth trying.

Shrimp wontons not limp!), & fish stomach soup (soul warming). Served with a huge bowl of white rice. We can eat a lot but we still had leftovers.  

Prices are $1-2 more pricey than what I'm used to for Cantonese food. Who've thought Cleveland would be more expensive than New York City?? 

The wait staff was very nice to us, even warning us that we're ordering too much food for 2 people. They also have specialty drinks like bubble tea & Thai coffee. 

Only downside is the sketchy neighborhood but parking is right outside and there's closed circuit monitoring of the parking lot inside the restaurant. The insides of the restaurant is also much much nicer than it seems from outside.",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"FOOD:
Best authentic Chinese food in Cleveland. I have pretty high standards for my Chinese food, and that's coming from a Chinese New Yorker.  I have tried many restaurants in Cleveland, and so far the others (Hunan East, Lai Wah, Siam Cafe, etc) don't compare. I come here about every two weeks and everything on the menu is good. Nothing they serve has been bad so far, but I would suggest avoiding the menu that has your typical American Chinese take-out. The wall is full of pictures end to end, that can serve as a good guide on what to order. Some of my favorites so far are: Garlic snow pea tips (kinda like Chinese spinach), Chive dumplings, Hong Kong style Lo Mein, Cumin beef, and XO fried rice. 

Pricing is very reasonable and they give you a large serving. If you order one dish per person, you'll definitely have tons of leftovers at the end. 

ATMOSPHERE:
Very casual place with its wooden tables and chairs, and fairly small. And honestly, you can easily drive by it without noticing it. But don't let looks fool you! If you want a nicer more formal atmosphere, Lai Wah down the street might be better. But the food and pricing at Wonton is unbeatable, that I always come here.",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"Rating this place high for hours, taste, quality and value. My husband and I discovered it a few months ago and were really impressed with the authenticity of the menu. I tried a dish that was new to me and was blown away by it. The dish was a type of dumpling, similar to a gnocchi, but not made with potato. 

We returned last night (Saturday) after a show at Playhouse Square. I called ahead to make sure they were still open and yes, they were open until Midnight. Huge win if you've ever struggled to find a place to eat past 10 or 11pm in this city. 

When you walk in you are greeted promptly by the owner with a big smile. While the seating options are limited in this small and very practical layout, he'll always ask you if the seat he offers you is OK. The tea that arrives almost immediately is loose leaf, and has a wonderful sweet flavor with no bitter taste to it. The woody bits and green leaves give it a gentle color and aroma that never turns too dark or intense over the course of the meal.

I've noticed there are two menus: the one they give you when seated, and the one sitting on the table. I think you can order from either. In fact, I think you can order whatever you want, and they will make it for you. I heard the owner talking with a customer at the table behind me about some food - a certain style oyster - that this customer had while he was abroad.  The owner said, ""Yes, yes, we can do that...come in next week and we'll have it for you, OK?""

Some people measure the authenticity of an ethnic restaurant by the number of cultural natives at the place. Judging by last night's crowd, this  one is the real deal. At 10:30 at night, there were tables and tables of Asian families dining, some large eating family style, others small enjoying a dinner date.

We ordered the chive pot stickers and a plate of fried rice ""young chow,"" which meant it had shrimp, ham, roasted pork, egg, cabbage, carrots, and peas. The potstickers were absolutely delicious, and the fried rice was perfection. If you think you've had fried rice at some places, you haven't had fried rice until you've had it here. Light, savory, and ""fresh"" is the best way I know how to describe it. You don't feel like you're eating a heart attack on a plate the way you can with some places' fried rice.  My husband also ordered a plate of chicken, which was perfectly sautee'd, not too greasy, and seasoned perfectly. 

Our bill for all this heaven was only $23. And we have enough left over for lunch today. Amazing.",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"This place is pretty F*cking good. All of the flavor and none of the glitz as some other places in China Town Cleveland. The pictures on the wall make it easy to try something authentic instead of some Moo-Go-Gi-Pan crap. The dumpling soups are the cure for what ever ails you. The service is great. I need to come here more often. With Hunan East around the corner its hard to justify the drive. When I order Chinese food from some place that is half way authentic I always ask for light on the oil. If you know how some of that stuff is cooked you would too. They did honor my request, thus no problems later in the evening. Oh did I mention that the prices are very reasonable? I ordered some Ho-fun noodles and they packaged the noodles and the sauce in different containers so they would not get soggy. That was most considerate. It took me 3 days to finish it. 5 stars and an F-Bomb. Almost put another F-Bomb in here but did not want to be a potty mouth.",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"Dang, this place is SO GOOD. Why can't we have a place like this in Detroit? Well, now that I think about it, it's a good thing that it's not near me, otherwise, I'd be going there very often, and it probably wouldn't taste as good after a while.

On our recent trip back from NJ and NY, we stopped in Cleveland for a break, and Yelp directed me to this little gem. Skeptical that there were so many raving reviews about an authentic Hong Kong style restaurant, and after seeing the tantalizing food pictures, Husband and I decided to give this place a try.

Boy, all the positive reviews were right!

We went with three dishes, though we wish we could have ordered more.

1. Beef Chow Fun ($7.95): Not oily or greasy, the noodles were a nice chewy bunch that was balanced with dry fried beef slices, bean sprouts, and onions. The soy sauce coated each noodle evenly. My only complaint is that the noodles were broken up, and not continuous in long strands. Otherwise, flavors were on point.
2. Jade tofu stir fry with fish fillets and vegetables ($13.95): HUGE portion! For the two of us, this one dish provided leftovers for 3 days!! The tofu was cut in small circular rounds and thinly fried, and the fish fillets were fresh and flaky with a light breaded coating. Sauce was a chicken base that wasn't overdone with cornstarch, and the vegetables were fresh, vibrant, and refreshing. Paired with steamed white rice, this dish was so flavorful without being salty.
3. Three flavor Dumpling Noodle Soup ($6.95): Fresh and house made dumplings! This bowl of noodle soup was really special. The lady making the dumplings towards the front of the restaurant was so nice, and I couldn't believe how tasty these dumplings were! One dumpling was a pork and shrimp with chives mixture, another was straight up pork and shrimp, and the last one was pork, leek, and cabbage dumpling. Paired with egg noodles and a pork soup base, this was perfect on a cool, rainy evening.

Service was great, and it was a packed house. Our tea was refilled promptly, and the waitress was nice enough to accommodate our request for no MSG in food. The meal was finished with 4 slices of oranges (tradition in most HK style restaurants), and plenty of to go boxes.

Final tab was $30, and leftovers for 3 days. Crazy I tell you, but it was sooooooo worth it.

So, next time you're in the Eastern part of Cleveland, stop by this place! We will certainly be back.

Closed on Tuesdays.",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"Wonton Gourmet & BBQ is THE place to go in Cleveland for authentic Asian food. I usually come here with a group of people and we share a bunch of dishes family style. This is a great place to do that, because the portions here are large and meant to be shared. This place is also good for a date, and my boyfriend and I love going here and sharing 2 dishes. We always have leftovers for a midnight snack. But I will have to admit, the ambiance is not really that romantic, so this place is not really for a 1st date, it's fine for a 96th date once you're comfortable enough with each other. Usually a meal here is $12-15 per person including tip. 

Service: Always great! The servers are really friendly and always smiling. They are really accommodating too, like once we asked if they would change the channel on their TV, and they did. Another time, my friend was not happy with her food and they took it off the bill. 

Food: OMG so good! I'll order the dishes from best to worst. We usually get the hot and spicy fish (which is very hot and spicy and flavorful). We also get the salted baked calamari or salted baked seafood, which is always fantastic. Sometimes we get the fish with sour vegetables, which I love but some of my friends think is too sour. We usually get veggie dishes as well: the Szechuan eggplant is may absolute favorite (even better with pork), the gai lan and kong shin tsai are also very good. The meat dishes are usually okay, we get the beef shortribs and cumin lamb, but the meat isn't always as tender as I'd like. The mapo tofu and Szechuan chicken here are not my favorite. 

Overall, this place is great for an awesome Chinese meal. Expect to have an excellent time and to be super full after leaving.",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,As soon as I walked in I noticed that the vast majority of customers were Chinese (which is a great thing if you enjoy authentic Chinese food). They have a decent selection of wontons and other HK favorites like fried dough with noodles. The portions are big and the prices are decent.  I'd also recommend coming here for a traditional Cantonese breakfast (congee and fried beef noodles).,1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"It pains me to have to write this review, because this is a restaurant that I have loved for quite a while now, and could always expect consistency from, but this place has most definitely slipped in quality since the previous owners & chef left. Even though its still one of the only restaurants in Cleveland that offers authentic Cantonese style dishes, the quality of the ingredients has been declining in the past year. The last couple of times I came, their namesake, the wonton noodle, hasn't been as good as it usually is, I chocked it up to a bad visit, and kept trying to come back, but each time I'm disappointed. I no longer get thick pieces of Chinese broccoli, but rather a few measly stems. The wontons are not even close to what they used to be, and the broth has lost its unique flavor.
I'll probably continue to come back here, but I am sad to report that I cannot endorse it wholeheartedly as I used to.",0
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"10 stars !!!  my favorite chinese restaurant in cleveland!  I am very picky when it comes to Chinese food (because I am Chinese and I know it when the food is authentic and good).  I visit this place at least once a week, no kidding.  The price is very reasonable, place is clean, and people is nice.  I have been living in Cleveland for almost 4 years, and I found this place about 2 years ago (WTH wrong with me?).  Once in a while I still visit Siam (another Chinese restaurant) but I can say that none of the Chinese restaurants around town can compare to this one.  You can get a wide range of Chinese food from this place.  (HK style, northern chinese style, etc)  MUST TRY their mike tea - hot or cold - you can't get more ""HongKong"" style than what they have.    

On top of the wonderful food, the most important thing is their owner.  I know him personally, and he really cares about the quality of food they serve and tries to keep his customers happy.  Let me just say this, Wonton Gourmet will be one of the few things I will miss about Cleveland when I move! =)",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"Good authentic Chinese restaurant.  It's a very casual place in a transitional area.  But they have dishes you don't find in most ""Americanized"" Chinese restaurants.  The cumin lamb was delicious and I really enjoyed chicken chow fun with pepper sauce.",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"Typical Chinese take-out restaurant atmosphere, but this place has really good everyday Chinese food!  Their foods range from simple lunch foods - wonton noodles, porridge, Chinese donut, fried rice, BBQ meats - to the more elaborate dinner plates - seafood, tripe, a slew of stir-fried vegetables, hot pots, etc.  Lunch is about $10pp, and dinner is around $20pp.  You know this place is authentic - besides the Chinese news and dramas playing on the TV, the restaurant is filled with Chinese people like me!",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"This place is truly authentic food with so many choices that you could eat there for many weeks and still not try everything on the menu.  Though it is authentic and tasty, I felt like it wasn't special enough to make me miss my usual Chinese spot.  

But you know this place has to be good when you see many tables and the waitlist full of Chinese families.",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"Cleveland Chinatown is pretty lackluster, but Wonton Gourmet & BBQ is a gem!

The kung pao chicken is sooooooooo good. The best I have ever had, and that is saying ALOT. (I'm craving it...as i type..and as i eat my breakfast....:p) Other than that, the mapo tofu and watercrest with garlic  that we ordered were pretty standard. I would have been more adventurous and ordered a few dishes that were more authentic, but I didn't want to overwhelm my non-Asian friend..

I thought the prices were reasonable for the amount of food we got, but the portions per order are definitely for sharing. There is no way one person would be able to finish one entire order by themselves (we tried, and had a pound of food left over...). You've been warned! (:

Anywho, I'll definitely be back if I find myself in the Cleveland area again! (:",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,This is the most authentic Chinese food I've had (and I'm Chinese). The dishes are full of flavor and well cooked. A Cleveland favorite.,1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"Best moo goo gai pan i ever had. Thats not all their Singapore mei fun, governors chicken eggrolls , potstickers, actially anything i have ever ordered amazing. Not to mention how nice they are. One time on busy friday they forgot eggroll when i ordered following monday mentioned it and they took care givingbus two no problem. This is BEST chinese food in cleveland hands down. They have americanized dishes as well as authentic Hong Kong Style food. You will not be disappointed.",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"Out standing Cantonese food and taste of China.  Have food from Taiwan,  China, Hong Kong style all in one!  Amazing combination but authentic taste of each. Price is low!Will sure come again!",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"Looking for a go-to Chinese joint when you get that craving? Look no further. There's literally no reason to go anywhere else in the area. This place is as authentic as it gets with lots of delicious options to satisfy any Chinese food craving. Nothing here tastes over salted, over cooked/ crunchy or over sauced-- which are all huge NO NOs when it comes to Asian cuisine, at least in my book. 

The service is always super nice. They have their own parking lot and heck, you can even keep an eye on your car from the parking lot with the way their security cameras are set up and on monitors inside the restaurant. Small but accommodating, simple and clean. 

There are pictures of  entrees on the wall that may look a little silly but actually make a ton of sense and are super helpful if you need help choosing between their yummy options.",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"This is the most authentic Cantonese food that you can find in Cleveland.  The restaurant is full of  Asian people.  This is the favorite hangout spot of the fobs at the Case grad school, and the default Chinese restaurant that my Asian friends go to as well.  They speak to each other in Chinese, they have Chinese on their menu and ghetto pictures of the food selections on the wall.

The food is a bit greasy at times, but with Cleveland's standards, it's quite authentic and quite good.",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,Good authentic Chinese.  Spicy wonton appetizer was excellent.  Was too full to try the rice roll donut but I'll be going back for it soon.  Very basic dining room but comfortable.  Service was polite and prompt.  I highly recommend for lunch.,1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"Spectacular. Huge and beguiling menu. Avoid the Americanized stuff and get some of the authentic dishes. We started with the chive dumplings and cold and spicy noodles before moving on to the beef with eggplant, shrimp dumpling soup with noodles, and pea greens with garlic. Each dish had sophisticated layers of flavor that really impressed us. Service is very fast - maybe too fast for some. This is not a white tablecloth place, but what's coming out of the kitchen would not be out of place at an incredibly pricey restaurant. Even after overeating, we had enough to feed four people with our leftovers the next day. So, six amazing meals for $50. Awesome. I'm really eager to go back.",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"The food is real. Some people are put off by the Chinese aspects of the place in that it looks, smells, and is an actual Chinese restaurants. It is a small place that is not fancy and isn't in the best location,  but who really cares with good food. The place is very clean with pictures of most of the food on the walls.  If you are looking for authentic  Chinese noodle soup you will be hard pressed to find better in the Cleveland area. They have several menus. They have the Hong Kong Style menu, the authentic Chinese mostly Cantonese menu and the Americanized Chinese style menu. I personally go for the Wonton with Noodle Soups or the hard to find Congee on the Hong Kong style menu. With 14 verities of Noodle soup, it  makes it hard for me to decide, Roasted Duck, Pork or Beef Brisket. The Wontons them self are light and delicious, with a good Shrimp flavor to them. The soup broth is delicate letting the meat and Wonton shine. So for those wanting eat more closely to like what you would get in China give it a try",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"This place is crazy authentic--like, waitresses don't speak english, fried pork intestines and pictures of the menu on the walls authentic. 

Like many other yelpers have mentioned, the service is very transactional, but not necessarily rude. The restaurant itself is a clean hole-in-the-wall, if that makes sense. I noticed there wasn't any carpet (thank god) and everything appeared pretty spotless. 

Then, for the most indecisive person in the world, the moment of doom: three menus (count 'em) chock-full of delicious/strange sounding noms. I just about had a panic attack trying to pic something when I remember fellow yelpers saying it's best to just order off the wall. Perfect! 

Our table of three way over ordered, but it was wonderful to be able to try a little bit of a lot of stuff! I ordered the roast pork wonton soup with noodles and the hot and spicy beef. The rest of the table ordered the garlic greens (name?), house potstickers, turnip cakes, roast duck wonton soup, fried pig intestines, and HK-style fried chicken. Let me start off by saying I did not have the balls to try the intestines, but my companions said it was crunchy, almost like a pork rind. I'll just have to take their word for it. 

The hot and spicy beef, garlic greens and pot stickers were my favorites. The beef was super tender and the sauce, although spicy, wasn't overly so. The greens were perfectly cooked and seasoned and the potstickers were crispy on the bottoms--yum! I tasted a little fishiness to the turnip cakes, so that turned me off and I didn't really try anything else. 

The bill was super small for all the food we consumed--eer boxed up, rather. But it was definitely a great first experience to truly authentic Hong Kong style Chinese food.  I'd definitely come back to try more off their three friggin menus!",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"If you feel adventurous and love spicy food, try their spicy pork intestines. It's actually very authentic. Also, their black bean with tripe are really good as well. These are 2 very different dishes from normal chinese dishes.
They were extremely busy on weekends around lunch, so try to go a little bit early or a bit later to avoid the rush.",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"Have eaten here for five years. Good flavor, but last time I ordered takeout, the food tasted microwaved. Would prefer fresher tasting dishes made fresh. If you are looking for authentic southern Chinese food, this is definitely the place to go. Not the most hygienic place and somewhat unwilling to give you napkins if you ask for more while dining there. There is definitely MSG in their food as I can taste it with their main dishes.",0
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"I have the most authentic wonton noodle in North America in this place. It tastes just like what I had back home. The beef is soft and the soup has sea food taste (which I like).
-------
folks, I came again recently. The congee is good but not the bubble tea....Besides, don't order shimp rice noodle roll. It is not FRESH!!! Smell funky too",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"Hungry?  For authentic Chinese food that tastes great, Wonton Gourmet & BBQ should definitely be on the short list of places to go.  Given its name, the Hong Kong style Wonton & noodle soups are a must-try.  They have shrimp wontons and there is also a three-variety dumpling version.  These are NOT the tasteless Americanized wontons that are made with thick doughy wrappers with hardly any meat - these are very tasty flavorful thin skinned wontons.  

I also really like their beef haw fun (wide noodles), salt baked seafood, and fish fillets and tofu.  Their XO seafood friend rice is also very tasty.  There's plenty of other good dishes to try also.  This is not a fancy place and is low in terms of decor or ambiance.  But as can be judged by the many Asians that frequent the restaurant, the focus is on authentic good Chinese food.

Oh, and don't be intimidated if you don't know Chinese and are not familiar with the cuisine.  They make it very easy as the walls are plastered with photos of all the dishes with an order number, the Chinese name, and the American name.  If your mouth is full and you want to order more, you can just point at the photos if you have to.  Enjoy!",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"I haven't been a big fan of this food in many years because of how much oil and sugar most places use.  There's a lot of fried food too.  This is a great authentic Chinese restaurant, however, and if you choose carefully you can eat a nutritious and healthy meal here.  I loved the chive pot stickers.  I chose poorly with the twice fried pork and the fried fish.  They were both seriously oily and while the flavors were outstanding it was too much for me.  I think one shared for a few people with some of their vegetable dishes and some soup would have been smarter.  The neighborhood is off-putting to say the least and the restaurant is nothing to look at on the inside but this place is a jewel nonetheless.  I would definitely return and try more!  Order off the wall or their non-American leaning menu.",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"I've been looking for an authentic chinese place to eat at and this place is it!! 

Its a small place with its own lot to the side, though the lot might look ""sketchy"" they do have cameras which does make me feel more comforted about safety. 

Inside theres someone at the counter that greets you and I came here by myself. They invited me to pick any  table as it wasnt crowded at all. A server quickly came over and took my drink order and asked if I knew what I wanted then he helped me look on the menu for what I was looking for. I ordered the shrimp wonton with roast duck with egg noodles. 

I waited about 10 minutes and then the food came out. It looked like a decent portion and the food was definitely filling. I thought I wouldnt finish it because it was alot of food. For a girl who doesnt eat alot, this would be shareable between 1 other individual who also doesnt eat alot. But for a guy, this would be just enough for one. 

Paying was super easy. Check was brought when the waiter saw I was just finishing up and I actually ordered something for take out so he had to fix my billing. It also didnt take long either. They do accept cash and card. 

Taking food togo, the waiter gave me some satay since he noticed I used it while I was eating my meal which I really appreciated! I do have to say, despite them giving me a large soup container, it was only filled about 1/3 up, maybe less than. I was alittle disappointed so i did add alittle bit of hot water to add alittle more soup because it wasn't enough to cover the noodles/food in my bowl at home. 

I'd recommend people here for groups of friends and family. Great options to eat family style or just individual portions! Great food and good service!",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"Very good authentic Chinese food. I'm Chinese and I love their food. I come at least once a month or so, at one time it was once a week almost. Come with a large group and do family style. The restaurant is kind of a hole in the wall compared to other places but the food more than makes up for it. Service is good, pricing is good.",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"Some of the best Chinese food in Cleveland. They have a small parking lot outside. While unassuming from the looks, the food is fast, hot, and super authentic. They have pictures of all the dishes on the walls to make it easier to figure out what each dish actually is. I go here with my friends and usually do family style and everyone is always stuffed afterwards.",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"I love it!! Only downside is staff is not friendly at all. Most of them barely speak English. That  part makes it more authentic. They have three menus one is just American Chinese and the rest real Chinese!! 

Delish and very inexpensive. Neighborhood slightly sketchy.",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"I would say this is the most authentic chinese food you will get in cleveland!  It's a hole in the wall type building, but inside is decent, has pics of food on the wall. I have been here a few times and I'm quite satisified with the food. I like the fried rice and the (lo mein) wide noodle with gravy.",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"So this is what Chinese food is supposed to taste like! Holy crap! So good!

Honestly, I was glad to be in dining with Chinese speaking friends or I may have struggled a bit with ordering.  I had no idea what was good (or what my friend ordered for me!) but when it all arrived at our table the portions were huge and delicious!  My favorites were the black pepper short ribs and the shrimp wonton soup.  We ordered four meals for three people and we had enough leftovers for probably another three people.  The portions are freakishly big!

I'm so glad to have tried this place out.  No fakey MSG-laden flavors here.  Everything is flavorful in an authentic way and I can't wait to go back!  I've been thinking about that sweet and sour sauce all day...",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"This place is everything others have said so I'll skip all that so you can read something new. 

The front lady was SUPER nice and helpful. They literally ask you to walk around the room and look at the pictures of food on the wall and pick what you want. (I was ordering to-go.) I'm a bigger fan of Manderin & Szechwan than Cantonese, but since this place is touted as the best Chinese in Cleve, I am there. 

I ordered: 
*Pork Pot Stickers w/ Green Onion = authentic and delightful
*Dandilion leaves sauteed = this is a lot like chinese broccoli or spinach and it doesn't disappoint
*Hot & Spicy Pork Noodle Soup= pretty good, but I had wanted Hot & Sour, they don't have it, so this is what I got. 
*Chicken Chow HoFun= very good, but dare i say it could have used more salt? 

I give this place 4 stars for being super authentic, VERY reasonable, GINORMOUS portions and for being incredibly kind to a blonde tourist walking in because of Yelp. 

My ONLY disappointment was the chinese donut. I asked the gal if i should get congee OR the donut, and she said you should get both. This seemed weird to me, why do I need two desserts? But now I get why, you have to coat the donut in something otherwise its just a naked churro with zero flavor. I wish she had just told me to get both, I would have seeing as I'm relying on her. 

On the whole, I am SO glad I went there as opposed to some americanized P.O.S. (piece of shit) strip mall joint. 

Enjoy!",0
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"Excellent, authentic Chinese food that you won't find in most Americanised, generic Chinese places. Pics on the wall help the unexperienced make their choices. Just like being in Hong Kong!",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"I went here a few more times after my last review and hate to say this but the food has gotten bad. First of all, don't take granted of their prices. They are marked on the menu as is but they'll tell you that it's actually higher and don't bother in changing the prices on the menu. Secondly, all of their foods are hella salty and has way too much MSG so if you're allergic and don't want to end up drinking tons of tea or water, ask without it. 

From the last visit which was this past Saturday, we tried their roast pork wonton soup and broth lacked authenticity. It tasted like definitely instant packet broth. This of course caused everything else in the dish as a failure. The lo mein noodles were literally just hard and lumped together. When I order my soup, I like it to be soupy hot and my noodles silky smooth. Then I can actually enjoy it. This was poorly incorporated. The vegetables, pork, noodles seemed separate from each other like they didn't belong together in the soup. I tried something different instead of ordering beef chow fun all the time so I tried the lo mein with beef brisket in HK style, price listed for $10.95 but waitress said its $12.95. horrible dish by the way. It was just stir fry lo mein noodles with Yu Choy and beef brisket. boring dish, which was really disappointing and overpriced!",0
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"Sooooo good. I'm from the DC area and every time I get the chance to visit Cleveland I try to make a visit to this yummy place. Maybe it's just me thing, but the authenticity in the style of Cantonese cooking here as well as the general vibe remind me so much of small little places in Hong Kong. I have left feeling full and satisfied in the few times I've dined in in the last five-ish years and the prices smile right back at me.",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"I love how authentic this place is. It's a nice place to have family style dinner. We got the seafood pan fried noodles. That was so delicious and fulfilling. Their tofu and dish was also a delight. I love how soft and egg-like the tofu was. We ordered a pork belly dish as well. The pork belly was so crispy and flavorful. I dipped it in a chilly oil sauce. Oh god, it was so good with the chili sauce. Moreover, they also gave us orange slices after we were done eating which was so refreshing",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"A few days ago I took my niece who is visiting from out of town for lunch at Wonton. She studied in China and remarked how much better the food was at Wonton. Since she traveled to several locations in China I accept her comment as having merit. I read reviews from New Yorkers whining that only NYC can make pizza. Californians snidely remark only they have good sushi or real Korean food. 

New Yorkers are too provincial to realize only they like flat foldable pizza. Californians fail to acknowledge that Japan buys its fish from Hawaii and Korean food served in LA is called California Korean. What does all this mean? There just is no authentic food. Each cook adds her own flair. As families gain more wealth they forgo the previous ""authentic"" cheap cuts for those more prime. Living in different regions means taking advantage of the local ingredients. Everyone in America makes chili. Whose can be called the authentic American chili? 

Is Wonton authentic Chinese? For the cooks there it is and that is good enuff for me. Some things I have had there are the best of class, e.g., the pot stickers. Some things are far from the best. The char siu pork wonton noodle soup looks beautiful with a generous slab of red char siu. However the five spice powder used on the pork is so cloying I can taste nothing else. 

Not everything will be to everyone's taste, but with thought any diner wishing a good Chinese dinner will find it here. May not be the first thing you order, but blame your ordering and not the food for any dissatisfaction. Remember you are not Chinese living in China, which my niece made clear has food not as good as Wonton.",0
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"this place is delicious. one of the first chinese places i went to when i first moved here, and still one of like two places i go for real chinese food. this is as authentic as it gets.
i always get my staples... house tofu, house eggplant with garlic sauce, and vegetable tofu panfried noodles. delicious.
i've also had their ramen at one point, and some other appetizers. everything is great. it's definitely oily, appropriately so for good chinese food, so don't come here expecting super healthy and go bitching about it! the vegetables are fresh tho, no question. and i'm sure there is plenty of msg in everything. msg is amazing. yes, it is the same thing as umami you crazy people!
another plus is the pictures on the wall. you get to know what you're getting into!",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,Great little hole in the wall in China Town! Real authentic Cantonese style cooking. I love getting the Beef Brisket wonton soup here.,1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"Sorry, Hunan East. You used to be my #1 but Wonton Gourmet just beat you. You want authentic food with reasonable price and quantity? Welcome to wonton gourmet!! 

I came here 3x within the last 2 weeks and I'm still craving it! The few dishes you must try: Chicken with Eggplant (forgot sauce name), Beef Ho Fun, & Tofu Seafood Pot (I think that's what it's called).

Let's start with Beef Ho Fun. Usually when I go to a Chinese restaurant for the first time, i already order beef ho fun. It's the easiest way to tell how good/bad a restaurant will be. And wonton gourmet, THANK GOD I FOUND YOU. I love it! i love it! this place is just delicious!!! Then, there's this chicken with eggplant dish that my friend insisted we ordered. The sauce didn't sound that exciting and I don't like to eat eggplant, but the sauce will make me order this dish forever again. Last, the tofu with seafood pot.... the tofu is my favorite kind of tofu in the world! And I finally found a place that cooks it.

Wonton Gourmet, thank you for existing in Cleveland. I will forever make sure you stay open and successful.",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"They have really great Chinese food here. Something about this place reminds me of the Chinese restaurants back in SF. The food and atmosphere screams authentic Chinese restaurant. Ordered a bunch of dishes to share family style and everything was spot on. The most special and memorable dish was the sauteed deep fried jade tofu with fish. The fish was crispy and saucy while the jade tofu was so silky and delicious. The other dishes (beef chow fun, fried potatoes with pork ribs, seafood pan fried noodles) were good too.",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Cleveland.

I have been on a long hunt for good Asian food places in Cleveland the past few months and am happy to place Wonton Gourmet at the top for Chinese picks!

A group of 4 of us shared 4 dishes which was plenty of food. We got a fried rice with Chinese sausage dish which was nice to supplement a Szechuan eggplant vegetable dish, fish, and beef dish.

There were plenty of vegetables in the eggplant dish. I especially like Chinese eggplant because I enjoy the texture and flavor more. Although sauce is heavy in this dish, I thought it was a perfect portion along with a balance between sweet and savory. It also comes with white rice!

The fish has a very silky texture, which is easy to fall apart. If you are more used to tougher fish, this smoother texture may throw you off. I did not find this dish to be too spicy either if you are worried about Szechuan peppers. 

The beef was AMAZING. I have satisfied my craving for savory Chinese food and I will definitely return. The pieces were large and generous with vegetables on the side. 

The dishes were definitely not like my parents' cooking which is simple and healthier with less sauce, but very reminiscent of it. If you are looking to satisfy an authentic Chinese food craving, I recommend this place! 

Overall, the service was prompt and helpful! They were quick to refill our tea and ask us if we needed anything else. They are popular for takeout orders in the evening, and let us know in case our order took longer. I found the food came out relatively quickly, and was pleased they were still considerate to notify us!",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"The Verdict: YASSSS! Actually authentic cantonese/Chinese food in Cleveland! Thank goodness!

The Food: I actually come here almost every weekend with my friends. The food is great, we eat family style and try a new dish now and then. Great hit dishes are ho-fun (a type of long flat noodles), shredded pork udon, salt and pepper pork, Beijing style pork (it's sweet and sour tasting), Szechuan-style pork, and pan-fried noodles. Their veggies are also very fresh. The dishes are huge and very affordable! We always go home full and satisfied.

The Extras: They have free private parking on the right side. They are open very late. Sometimes it can be crowded, so you know it's legit! But that's only rarely. The menu comes in English and Chinese, and waiters and waitresses are very nice. They take credit card.",1
wftmt-n8OUA4Ng3bWWH5dw,"4.5 stars. This little hole in the wall is one of my favorite Cantonese restaurants in Cleveland. The food never disappoints, the portions are big and the prices are fair. Minus half a star because when I went here for lunch a few days ago, the waitress asked my friend and I three times within five minutes if we were ready to order. I didn't like feeling rushed, especially when it wasn't that busy. 

We ended up ordering the beef chow fun and fried pork chops. The pork chops came with a side of rice. I highly recommend both of these dishes! They are so flavorful and filling. The portions were big enough for both of us to take home leftovers. Although I thought the service could've been better, definitely come here if you're craving some authentic Chinese food.",1
WG3zvUktE1l3llwq3PPVVg,"Nate's serves authentic Lebanese food. I was introduced to this place when I worked on Franklin about 12 years ago. I since left the area, but returned twice over the last 10 years. The baba ghanoush is exceptional...very flavorful and made with care. I recommend the Hummus and Shawarma (beef or chicken). You will not be disappointed!",1
WG3zvUktE1l3llwq3PPVVg,"I must preface by saying I have been frequenting Nate's for well over a decade.  The owner is a very close friend of my family, however that has no impact what-so-ever on my review.

-

Being Lebanese and having lived in the Cleveland area my entire life, there have really only been two options in Cleveland for the best Middle Eastern cuisine, both being Lebanese restaurants (Lebanese define Middle Eastern food, ask Anthony Bourdain).  Besides Nate's, the other - now closed - was The Middle East Restaurant over on E.9th & Prospect.  After that restaurant closed, Nate's remained as the undisputed champion of Middle Eastern restaurants in the Cleveland area.

I've been eating these foods my entire life and knowing how they SHOULD taste, I can honestly say that Nate's is truly on point in terms of authenticity.  Whether it's mezza like hummus, tabouli, fattoush, baba or meals like shawarma, falafel, kefta; All are extremely tasty at Nate's.

If you're daring and not a vegetarian, try the kibbeh nayeh (if available).  It's more of a delicacy and may require an acquired taste.  A lot of Lebanese jokingly judge how well of a cook you are on your ability to properly (key word) prepare it.  I've had it here, it is excellent.  Only one place I've ever been (in the US or in Lebanon) has made it better.

All in all, Nate's is an Ohio City legend.  If you haven't tried it, do yourself the flavor ;)",1
WG3zvUktE1l3llwq3PPVVg,"Nates has the best hummus I have ever ever had! I love when you come in through the back door, you walk through the kitchen area and you see the family working on the food! It's just authentic good, fresh, fantastic flavorful food.  Very casual, yet exclusive because it's just nothing fancy but the food and service are fantastic. That's what counts. I love the hustle and bustle atmosphere. Very NYC!",1
WG3zvUktE1l3llwq3PPVVg,"Best Lebanese restaurant in Cleveland! Great service, vey welcoming :)
The Lebanese food is authentic. The atmosphere is cozy.",1
WG3zvUktE1l3llwq3PPVVg,"If you're from Cleveland and haven't been to Nate's shame on you. If you're visiting from out of town make it a point to stop in, either before or after your visit to the West Side Market.  

In the 23 years that I have been going to Nate's I have yet to sample anything other than their fantastic Lebanese food from their menu. Instead of a deli sandwich, make sure you try the superb baba ganooj and the beguilingly creamy hummus ($4.25/$6.95). The pureed eggplant is slightly smoky with the perfect balance of tahini and lemon. The hummus is addicting and you will want to eat it with everything; don't blame me if you find yourself dipping everything and anything in it, just like they do in Sandler's ""You Don't Mess with the Zohan"", trust me it's that good. Each of these delicacies is drizzled with olive oil, served with warm pita, and piquant, garishly colored pickled turnips.  

Next, try the Shish Tawook Sandwich ($5.50) - a rolled up piece of pita bread (like a cigar) contains tender cubes of chicken breast and a zippy garlic mayo. If you're looking for something more substantial, the beef Shawarma Platter with hummus ($12.75) will definitely satisfy. 

The fattoosh ($5.50) is equally satisfying in the ""I-need-something-green"" kind of way; mercifully the toasted pita chips remain crisp and you get plenty of tomatoes, green peppers and onions mixed with the lettuce, oil and vinegar. The tabbulee ($3.75/$6.50) at Nate's has the requisite zing from the fresh lemon juice based dressing without making your lips pucker like in some versions that I've had in those new age hippy-dippy joints. This is the real thing.

For me, dropping into Nate's is like visiting my own family where the surroundings are well-known, the greetings sincere and relaxed, and the aromas familiar. The food is authentic, unpretentious, and remarkable for its consistency. There are some things that shouldn't change; I'm thankful Nate's hasn't.",1

WG3zvUktE1l3llwq3PPVVg,"Nate's is my favorite Lebanese restaurant in Greater Cleveland. The menu has some deli sandwiches (i.e., corned beef, etc.), but the main attraction is the Lebanese food. Walk back through the narrow passage to the restroom, and you'll pass by the bustling kitchen where (presumably) Lebanese women chop fresh beets to garnish the delicious, authentic dishes. This is a great alternative to Americanized takes on Lebanese in the area, and its location just steps from the West Side Market makes for a real urban experience. Easily reached from the RTA Red Line, one station west of Tower City Center... Highly recommended!",1

This bar is a former bank vault and definitely has a speak-easy style. The atmosphere is so vintage with the elaborate decor and lounge seating style. 

You will get lost in the Vault. No seriously this place is like a maze with so many authentic rooms and areas to explore. It's so much fun! I went with a group of friends on a Friday night and there was a decent crowd - not too crowded but not too empty. It was perfect! 

The cocktails were delicious (although a bit pricey) and the music was on point. We danced for hours, met new people and took one too many selfies in their luxurious lounge chairs! It's so much fun.

I'm planning on buying tickets to their New Years Eve party and I'm beyond excited!!",1
wib5LeUWBkxu67Rl3ruMDQ,"Well I wandered into this little place on a cold Monday night. It maybe easy to miss on the outside because its not clustered in the main section of W 25th in Ohio City flanking the WSM. But this place is definitely worth checking into. The Yelp reviews are right! The inside of Porco is really clean and cute kitschy - the walls are adorned with various tiki glasses. I started off with the Lugh which was nice and flavorful but not overly sweet. It is based with their passionfruit mix which is excellent, not the processed syrups that u find in most bars. Then I followed up with the heart of darkness because I just liked the name of the drink lol. But I enjoyed the drink just as much if not more than the name. I forget the name of the drink my companion ordered but it was smokey and bubbly and quite delicious. Next they followed up with the Mai tai which is one of the best I have ever had. To re-up for the next part of the evening we each got an order of tacos - which comes with 3 tacos;  1 pulled pork, 1 chorizo, and 1 barbacoa. All the tacos were delicious, i think the barbacoa was my favorite. Served authentic style dbl soft corn shell with lime on the side. Really fresh and flavorful and reasonably priced! Next we completed the evening with a mead flight which was quite delightful. Basically like a honey wine. This is the perfect time of year for it. Last but not least, the bartender, Shawn, was great. He didnt mind answering questions and telling us about the various drinks available. Additionally, he is quite entertaining as well. They are planning to open a patio next year which I am already looking forward to.  If you are looking for a mini vacation I suggest u check out Porco. its like being on vacation in a resort town until that cold air hits u on the walk back to your car.",1
wib5LeUWBkxu67Rl3ruMDQ,"Fantastic experience.  This is an Ohio City treasure.

We brought my sissy here yesterday to get birthday cocktails.  It's a little further down from the main drag on w. 25th.  We came at 4pm, right when they opened.  There's not a ton of parking and only one medium sized sign on the side of the building.  As we were walking toward the back door, my husband was a bit skeptical.  He made a few remarks about it looking abandoned.  Don't let the outside fool you.  The inside is cozy, and authentically decorated.  I'm not into the tiki scene (actually, I didn't know there even WAS a tiki scene) but the decor was really cool without being over-kitsch.  It was just enough kitsch.  

We got there before the rush.  I guess around five on weekends and sometimes week nights, the place fills up and doesn't empty out until closing.  Which is awesome for the bar!  So glad that they're doing good business! We were glad we got there before everyone else, though.  Our bartender was kind, professional, knowledgeable, and seemed to really enjoy his job.  He took the time to explain each drink on the menu for us, and brought us some samples of a few of their house-made ingredients. Delicious!  One was made with coconut and orange juice and some things.  Another was a lime concoction that takes days to brew up.  It was really amazing to me that they take such care with their ingredients which were all delicious on their own!

We ordered our drinks including a Pain Killer, a Zombie, and a Mai Tai.  Delicious.  I am a simple wine, beer, shot kind of girl and don't put out for cocktails very often.  When I do try one, I am usually disappointed.  These were amazing.  Some of their drinks have more than ten ingredients.  They each came gorgeously embellished with fruit, fun straws, and little mermaids.  The presentation was top knotch.  The Zombie had dry ice in the bottom.  It bubbled and smoked the entire time sissy and I sipped on it. It was fruity and bitter and delicious.  No over sweetness or weird aftertastes.  The Painkiller was creamy and decadent without being overly sweet.  All of the drinks were large and strong, meticulously made, and definitely worth what we paid for them.  

This place is a passion project of a great guy who just loves tiki culture.  He started this place as a method of self-expression and I am so glad that it's doing well for him and people are enjoying it.  We met the owner--super nice, made sure we were having a great time, then retreated to the kitchen to make tacos.  They are supposed to be expanding the menu in the next few months, all the food is made with local ingredients and they've spent months working with chefs to get the new food just right.  I can't wait to go back and show off this place to someone else.  

Great drinks, great atmosphere, amazing service.",1
wib5LeUWBkxu67Rl3ruMDQ,"It's a tiki bar in Cleveland. That alone should peak your interest. 

Porco has the charm of a long forgotten world, where airmen were seeking a bit of exotic culture but without any of that authenticity. The room feels like it could have arrived from 1950's Honolulu, a mix of Hawaiian kitsch and American duplicity. 

But seriously, the drinks are amazing. Authentic tiki drinks, loaded with alcohol and mini umbrellas, that taste amazing and are enough to knock you on your back. There's even a warning on the Zombie, for anyone considering the black-out beverage. 

Eat before, and have a designated driver. You'll need it!",1
wib5LeUWBkxu67Rl3ruMDQ,"Smokey beverages, mermaid drink stirrers, monkeys surfing in a giant burning volcano?  

Yes please.  And more.  And then another.  And then don't even think about driving.

I wasn't sure what an ""authentic tiki bar"" was until Porco's, but now I know it's a delightful, quirky establishment with well balanced beverages, incredible service, and tacos.  

It's not the easiest location to find, and it's certainly not walkable... but this little slice of tiki glory is easily one of the best bars in Cleveland.  

The drinks are incredible... they are measured and perfected.  Each sip is a delight.  Between the four of us we covered a substantial amount of beverages, and we were thrilled with the variety and quality we experienced.

Go here.  Go now.  And decide on a DD early on!",1

These are not your typical tacos, but more the authentic with the perfect amount of lime.

 Downer-The neighborhood isnt that great/industrial part on the south side of W25. They also do not have any TV's if you wanted to catch a game- but hey who needs them after great hospitality and drinks!",1

""You came all the way to a Tiki bar to order a beer?""

Yeah ass-hat, I did.
Came here to meet a friend who happens to enjoy Tiki drinks (believe or not I do too!). I just wanted a beer on this particular night. My friend proceeded to apologize to the bartender for me, and he still acted dark toward both of us, as if we owed him our business in the first place. It was that feeling you get when you want to believe someone is just giving you a hard time/joking around, but they continuously prove you wrong with their authentically sour vibe. My friend nervously and jokingly said ""he's just here for the nachos"" and the next thing we knew there was a giant serving of nachos in front of us. We looked at each other puzzled.

I've recently re-located to Chicago, but I've been a Cleveland head for years, grew up there. I understand what it means to be a part of a scene, a movement, a progressive generation... whatever. The moment you let your worthless trends and pretense affect how you treat others, guess what? You're no longer progressive.

Don't want to get too deep into it, the fact is this: avoid the dude with the dark beard.

It's hard to enjoy yourself if you feel like you're not welcome - so regardless of drink or food quality, Porco gets a lonely 1-star rating.",0
wib5LeUWBkxu67Rl3ruMDQ,"This place is about as good as it gets. I have come here for every occasion - first date, group birthday party, grabbing a drink with a friend's parents - and it is perfect for every single one. During my first visit, there were a total of four people in the whole bar, so we got to talk to the bar tender and the owner for quite some time. We learned the whole history of the bar, the history of tiki, and how they make their drinks so authentic. I was immediately impressed.

I've ordered a fair number of drinks, including the Pain Killer (phenomenal), their whiskey sour (best whiskey sour I've EVER had, and that's my go-to drink), and Heart of Darkness (I think that's the name? Also, outstanding), among others I can't recall the names of. A friend's mother ordered a mead during one visit, which was sweet and delicious, and I've tasted quite a few of their beers - also can't complain about that selection.

The waitstaff and bar tenders are incredibly attentive and will answer any questions that you have. The decor is outstanding, and all drinks are garnished beautifully. I love the little plastic monkeys, mermaids, sea horses, etc., that they put on each drink - it makes the experience that much more fun.

My only complaint is that the parking lot is small. But I would park blocks away and walk to this place if I had to - Porco's is perfect.",1
wib5LeUWBkxu67Rl3ruMDQ,"This place is amazing--I'm so happy it exists. It's one of those places that doesn't look like much on the outside, but on the inside it's warm and happy. Welcome to Cleveland. :)

Great ambiance - warm red tones with tiki decor hanging from the ceiling. Plenty of smaller tables for small groups. There's also a larger table surrounded by curtains that you can reserve for groups of 8-10. 

Our larger group also shared a bunch of appetizers. My favorite was the black bean quesadilla. We also shared the nachos. It's huge! It's also a bit on the salty and spicy side. 

The drinks are well mixed (definitely recommend the Painkiller!) and the price is right. Apparently this tiki bar has been around since the 60s, and they pride themselves on making authentic tiki drinks! If you're looking for somewhere fun to go with friends, I definitely recommend Porco.",1
wmstf9dw0-kN3YThIxx8eQ,"Stone Mad has a lot of things going for it, and over the last few months I ended up there one way or another several times.  The interior really nails the look and feel of an authentic pub, and the outdoor Flintstone-cum-Stonehenge patio is the greatest of all henges (at least in Cleveland).  If you go, make sure to visit the beautiful, but oddly psychedelic bathrooms downstairs.  The bocce ball court in the back is a neat touch too.  

They seem to have a good selection of beers (I don't drink so...) and the menu though limited, has been pretty good in my experience.  The burgers and salads are large, and the baked brie and strawberries are a nice appetizer.  The reason my review isn't better is mostly due to two things.  No soda on tap, so $2 get's you a mixer sized can of pop, and no refills.  For a non-drinker like me, this is a drag, plain and simple.  The other thing I have found is that the service can be hit or miss, and in one case downright rude to my family.  I wasn't present for this incident, but have no reason to disbelieve them.  I have been back a couple of times since then and the service has been passable to great.  

Regardless, it's a place with a lot of charm, and it appeals to old and young alike.  I would not hesitate to return, especially if someone was in from out of town and wanted to see some of what makes Cleveland great.",1
wmstf9dw0-kN3YThIxx8eQ,"I was so jazzed about trying out Stone Mad on our Thursday night date night (before catching a showing of Jurassic Park at Capitol Theatre) and even more jazzed that we had time to have the whole ""Stone Mad Experience"" - from patio, to food, to the crazy cool potty in the basement, to oh yes, bocce ball. It was lovely.

First things first: parking. When we got there it was kinda early (6ish) and I noticed a number of spots out front on the street - some of them would have required parallel parking - but that's no big. We ended up parking in Capitol's lot (probably would not suggest this on busier nights because its rude to steal other people's spaces, but I figured we were headed over after dinner so why not).

As we sauntered down w.65th toward Stone Mad it was a scorcher - must have been at least 90 degrees and some ridiculously high level of humidity - so we decided to have a drink at the bar before grabbing something to eat on the patio. We entered through the front door - and as per usual I was confused, do I push, do I pull, do I bust through with both arms? It was like a swinging door type thing but with two sides and I must have looked like a fool trying to make my way through. Once inside there wasn't like a hostess, just the bartender, and a few people milling around the gorgeous warm toned wooden bar, the place just felt very authentic.

They had some happy hour pricing going on so I had an unauthentically Irish rum and diet and the boy toy ordered up some of his favorite, Strongbow. As we sat chatting at the bar I noticed other people were coming in and making their way to the back of the restaurant to seat themselves. To make truly sure it was a ""seat yourself"" type deal we asked the bartender and he said that was cool for inside but that outside there was probably someone to seat you. We picked up our drinks and headed back through the restaurant to make our way to the patio. We were greeted with even more beautiful, warm, and inviting woodwork with cozy little tables spread about. Making our way through the side entrance we headed out to the patio - greeted with a beautiful stone fireplace, plenty of stone seating, and a waterfall. We were given the option to seat ourselves and chose a nice shaded area toward the back of the patio. Was such a great atmosphere that even in 90 degree weather - it was still enjoyable. We then ordered a couple more drinks - a blueberry thrill for me (Stoli Blueberry vodka infused with fresh lemonade, shaken and trimmed with fresh blueberries) and another Strongbow for the man. With our drinks came a cup of pickles - a few tiny ones, a few regular slicked dill spears - I was loving it. Since we had a lot of time before the movie we decided to space out our meal and ordered the Stuffed Peppers (peppers stuffed with chorizo, served atop house made marinara sauce) as an appetizer - so yum. Once it came down to our dinner selections we decided to share and ordered up a Turkey Club (hand carved turkey, with bacon, Irish cheddar, havarti, lettuce, tomato, and mayo), the Famous Beef Brisket (slow roasted, hand-carved, and served on a dusted roll with horseradish sauce and au jus), some creamy mascarpone polenta, and home fries. Everything was delectable.

After dinner we were dying for some A/C so we paid our bill and made our way back inside to take another look around. Since it was pretty empty, we made our way to the back to check out the bocce court. I was super excited because nobody was playing and there was only one table of four seated back there so I wouldn't be embarrassing myself in front of too many people with my poor bocce ball handling skills. I asked one of the waitresses if we were allowed to just play, and she said ""of course!"" so we (drinks in hand, since the sign doesn't forbid it) headed into the court. Of course the boy and I had to google bocce ball rules (thank god for iPhones!) and after some reading up on it decided that we didn't have to be too technical about it. And in case you're wondering - you're supposed to take the smaller ball (the pallina) have someone throw it (underhand only) and then try to get the bigger balls (each team has four) closest to the pallina without touching it or hitting the back wall (alternating turns). Whoever ends up with the closest ball (or balls) to the pallina scores points. Long story short, the boyfriend ended up beating me (but not by much!).

Since I had perused Yelp before coming down - I knew I had to check out the amazing downstairs bathroom before we headed down to the theatre. I just had to figure out how to get there first. So, we ended up asking the bartender and were told that ""its the coolest thing about the place"" and then pointed in the right direction (you get to the stairs through the front bar area to the left of the door that leads back to the dining area). The bathroom is as cool as the pictures make it look.

All in all, great Irish experience. We shall return. SlÁE¡inte, Stone Mad!",1
wnyMhlR5KCWkTCzQ1_gOUQ,"This place is hands down my favorite Mexican restaurant in Cleveland! 

Yes, there are more trendy places. You can go get a crazy taco somewhere or really unique gacamole for $10 somewhere else. But this place is authentic (as far as I can tell), cheap, super filling and delicious! 

The table salsa is probably my favorite table salsa ever. There are two kinds and both are nice and spicy. They also provide fresh chips and some pickled veggies to munch on (YUM). The sangrias are HUGE and there are a few Mexican beers to choose from, as well. 

The menu is large and so are the portions. Everything I have tried here so far has been really tasty. Nothing insane - very basic stuff - but I promise you that it's better than all of those chain Mexican places or the ten other restaurants with identical menus (see el Jalapenos and and Si Senior - I kid you not, the menus are the same). 

Servers were friendly and food came out pretty fast. I have zero complains. It also hasn't been crowded, in my experience. Like I said before, it's not trendy or innovative, really, but if you are just craving Mexican, this place is the best!",1

wnyMhlR5KCWkTCzQ1_gOUQ,"This is a taste of Mexico. I have been to Mexico and nothing in the states that I've had is exactly like the food there, but this is the closest thing I've had to it in the city. 

Nuevo is one of my faves, but they are Americanized and don't carry the same variety of dishes as Mi Pueb. I have been to Arizona and they are the Mexican food capital. The taco's are prepared at Mi Pueb exactly as they are in Arizona. Great tasting, fresh, white corn tortilla, stuffed with chorizo or carnitas or steak or barbacoa, served with pico and lettuce. I have tried them all, my favorites are carnitas or the chopped steak (don't remember the actual name for this meat). Also, I thoroughly enjoyed the tamales. The red sauce on my enchilada's was a little bitter, so I'd rather to do tacos or tamales any day.

I love spicy, so I crave their salsa that they serve upon seating with tortilla chips. I ask for no beans or salad with my entree (they just take up room on the plate as far as I'm concerned). The rice is nothing special but doused in the red or green salsa, is fine. 

I have tried the flan and tres leches cake as well, both were good. Also, try the rice water if your into that sort of thing. 

Most authentic Mexican tacos around, I'd stick with something simple like a burrito or tacos. I also recommend mixing and matching, i.e. one carnitas taco, one fish taco and one tamale. If you do, you wont be disappointed. Yum-mo.",1
wnyMhlR5KCWkTCzQ1_gOUQ,"Impressed? Yes. Muy, muy impressed. 

After hearing about the tasty-factor of this authentic Mexican resto for what seems like years now, I finally got around to paying a little visit. It was the perfect timing too because I was having one of those ""I'm a freaking bottomless pit"" days when you're consistently starving. So, by the time I got there I was ready to gnaw the leg off my table. 

Luckily a swifty server swept by with stealth like movements and suddenly there were two gloriously hot salsas and fresh chips in front of my face. For me? Why, you shouldn't have! I'm usually pretty pleased with salsa in general, but hot-damn. Mi Pueblo must have done research on my life prior to be stepping foot in the door, otherwise I'm not sure how they knew how much I love heat. I'm talking burn your mouth salsa that packed a punch, but not too hot to eat. Flavors galore, folks. You could taste the roasted peppers in each. This could have been my entire meal and I would have been more than satisfied. One word: Happiness.

I had the usual issues when it comes to looking though a textbook thick menu: anxiety, indecisiveness and stressed. This is usually the point where the server has stopped by at least three times already and I've told him/her ""I'm not ready yet."" This is also when I can feel myself being annoying. Finally, I stopped being an idiot and ordered a bean burrito with rice and beans. 

So, you know that sign outside Mi Pueblo that mentions they have the biggest burritos in town? Well, that night I found out the hard way that they weren't lying. This 15 lb delicious beast was filled with cheese, beans, sour cream and wonderful things. I made it through 1/4 of this thing and called it quits. I could barely lift my take-out box on the way out. 

Oh, and they have a kids menu as well. This was the savior of the evening as a little mini cheese quesadilla with fries came out for the little man. Add that to a menu they can color with crayons and you have a happy youngin'.

The moral of this story is that Mi Pueblo is delicious. Period. Go there. I'm not a Mexican food guru, and I doubt anyone who hasn't lived in or was born in Mexico really is (as much as they may claim to be.) But what I can tell you is that if you DON""T go here, a little piece of you might wither away. Now, I'm off to enjoy my leftovers for the 5th night in a row.",1

wnyMhlR5KCWkTCzQ1_gOUQ,"I disagree with the other reviewer in that I think the food here is quite outstanding.  This is certainly a more authentic Mexican restaurant: the food is coarse and quite different from the typical run-of-the-mill Tex-Mex.

The menu is also quite large.  Everything I've tried has been good, although some things have been better than others.  There are many items on the menu that can be difficult to find elsewhere, including some good seafood items, and some big soups/stews (including some that aren't on the menu but that the local Hispanic people will often be eating).

They serve drinks, with a good selection of Mexican beers.

The atmosphere in this location is nice, but it is less fancy than you would expect for the price (this place is not terribly expensive but it's not cheap like you might expect).  It feels more like an upscale cafeteria with a small dining area attached--the kitchen is semi-open.  Like the other reviewer said, this place is always hopping!  This west-side location is the one that is frequented by the local Hispanic population, and I think that says a lot about the quality and authenticity of the cuisine.  The east-side location has almost the same food, but a very different atmosphere.",1

The prices were decent and the decor was as everyone else has described it. 
But what I didn't expect was to contract viral gastroenteritis from this place and remain sick for several days. If you don't know what this is, look it up. It sucks.

Anyway, it's not as easy in Cleveland, Ohio to find decent, much less fantastic, authentic Mexican food.... but you really only need one, and that one is Mi Pueblo.

The prices are reasonable, especially when you see the amount of food you get.  Now I have been known to clean my plate in Mexican Restaurants, regardless of my fullness, regardless of the pain of my stomach stretching to new sizes, regardless of the food coma that I know will hit me shortly after eating that much food.  I love Mexican food so much that I just can't stop.  Mi Pueblo, however, served me so much food, that I could barely eat half my meal.  This does not mean I did not love every bite, because I did, there was literally that much food.

Of course we started by munching on the usual chips and salsa.  The salsa, however, is not so usual.  You get one red and one green and they are both fantastic.  We then got an appetizer (this could be considered a mistake, considering we knew how much food would be coming... but ooooh it was so good... trust me... get the app and then bring some of your meal home.)  We chose the ""Queso Fundido con Rajas.""  Just thinking about it makes my mouth water.  For those of you less proficient en Espanol, this is a plate of melted Chihuahua cheese with poblano peppers which comes with warm tortillas to wrap it all up in.  This is one of my favorite appetizers of all time.  If you are a cheese addict like me, you need this!

Then our meals came.  Jason ordered the Flautas, which were piled high with cheese, lettuce, sour cream, and home made guacamole...  They were good, really good.  There was so much food on his plate you really could not see the plate, between the rice, beans, four flautas with the previously described toppings and a little arrangement of lettuce tomato and I believe cucumber for those trying to consume something healthy along with this meal :)

My meal was way more than expected.  I ordered the Gorditas.  I actually thought I would be getting one gordita, along with rice and beans.  Instead, my rice and beans had to be served on a separate plate because the THREE gorditas on the other plate didn't leave room for side dishes.  These things are like thick, crispy, taco sandwiches.  I got the carnitas (shredded pork), which was cooked perfectly.   I had enough left over to eat a second very filling meal today for lunch, and honestly, should have split it into three -- but I am a glutton for punishment.  Each gordita is plenty of food on it's own.

I wish I knew more about the history of this place.  I don't know how long it's been there, but I believe it's been a long time.  Everyone who works there is super friendly and they have a great jukebox filled with Mexican and Tejano music.  We always go to the original one on Lorain Rd, but I believe there is also one located in University Circle.  We've gone for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and were never once disappointed.   I highly, highly, recommend Mi Pueblo for  your next Mexican meal.",1
wnyMhlR5KCWkTCzQ1_gOUQ,"Good, but not worth all the hype.  I don't know or really care all that much what California Mexican is, but feel sorry for you guys if this is what it is, because I assure you it isn't authentic Mexican.  It wasn't terrible, in fact I had quite a good experience, but I was expecting a more authentic experience from somewhere with these reviews.  Tacos with lettuce and tomatoes??  I expect that at Taco Bell, but ""con todo"" usually means onios and cilantro, and if your lucky some radish and cucumber on the side.  I had a chile relleno, which was pretty good, but my chicken taquitos were beef, no biggie though, I like everything, just expect to get what I order.  What really confused me, is I ordered Guacamole, and our server said ""no more guacamole"", and walked away without any other explaination.  OK, if they're out, I understand, but then when my meal came out with guacamole, I got a little more confused.  As far as Al Pastor goes, not in my top ten, but I am very picky about it, and have been spoiled down in Columbus, as they have tons of amazing Mexican joints.",0
wnyMhlR5KCWkTCzQ1_gOUQ,"the new grocery store they have opened on Lakewood Heights blvd ROCKS! The service is friendly, they answer any questions you have. They have really tasty samples for you to try and and the taco stand has multiple filling choices and would be approved  by Anthony Bourdain as truly authentic Mexican...

I am so lucky to have this nearby!",1
wnyMhlR5KCWkTCzQ1_gOUQ,"This is the most authentic Mexican food I've had since I've been in Cleveland. 
The Quesadilla Sincronizadas are AMAZING (one of my favorites on the menu). everything is well seasoned and extremely fresh. It's the perfect place to go when I'm feeling a little home sick.",1
wnyMhlR5KCWkTCzQ1_gOUQ,"In honor of the past, this place was the real deal.  Consistent and probably the best authentic Mexican in the city.  Found them at the Taste of Cleveland in 1996 and going since.

wnyMhlR5KCWkTCzQ1_gOUQ,"i am a california, mexican  transplant to the cleveland area.  i was longing for the authentic taste of the hole in the wall taquerias that are so prevalent in the mexican hoods of L.A. when i happened upon Mi Pueblo.  My prayers were answered.  The food is as authentic as it gets and whenever I need a taste of home that's where I head to.",1
wnyMhlR5KCWkTCzQ1_gOUQ,"This one'll be short, since I've only been there once so far, but I really dig this place.  A friend introduced me to them recently and I had a great experience there!

My avocado taco meal was delicious (and inexpensive!) and the chicken soup that came with it (that comes with everything, as a matter of fact) was pretty tasty, though on the brothy side.  The beans, rice... everything... was cooked superbly - and authentically - and was very flavorful.  

I loved the atmosphere, and there were a lot of people there, so it was great relaxing amid the chatter and bustle of a successful eatery.  The light is great, and our server was extremely attentive and knowledgable.

One point missed because my friend is vegan and there was cheese on his plate after he'd asked that it be left off, but it was not that big a deal.

I'd definitely go there again for some yummy Mexican!  

(Food.  Yummy Mexican FOOD.)",1
wnyMhlR5KCWkTCzQ1_gOUQ,"As a Mexican I find this place offensive to my taste buds. This is not the best mexican food anywhere, ever, at all. 

My sister-in-law and I were in the area and craving authentic tacos, saw the rave reviews and decided to give it a try. 

The chips promptly delivered to the table were not bad, a bit stale but palatable. The salsa on the other hand was aone-note flavor of just chili. Good salsa is characterized by a subtle blend of key flavors like garlic, onion, cilantro, lime, salt and the chili. 

I ordered a carnitas and picadillo taco. My sister got lengua (tongue) and tripas (stomach lining). Yea, she is hard core! But we spent over 10 years actually living in Mexico City and know how this is supposed to taste. 

First, lets start with lettuce and tomatoes on tacos. That is just not right and the first sign of inauthenticity. Taco Bell serves lettuce and tomato on their tacos. At least they didn't use shredded cheese.

Second, carnitas are not supposed to be dripping in grease. They are supposed to be a touch crispy, tender and mouth-watering. I literally had a puddle of oil on my plate. Picadillo is not supposed to resemble mushy, pastey sloppy joe. My sister-in-law said her tacos were a bit off namely too chewy and tough. She only took a few bites of each.

Third, the rice is bland. It is supposed to be light, fluffy and again the subtle blend of flavors including tomatoes, chicken stock, salt and cumin. This was just blah, no flavor and mushy with random carrots.

Fourthly, the beans. They were from a can. I'm convinced. It had the twang of tin can that hit your senses as soon as you took a bite. You know the funky aftertaste, that would be the ring of the aluminum. They weren't even brown, they had a red tinge to them and were quite runny. Oddly enough the oil from the carnitas did not add to the flavor of the beans.

We left most of our meal on the plate. We have no desire or need to ever go back.",0
wnyMhlR5KCWkTCzQ1_gOUQ,"In an effort to try new places to eat rather than the old fav's Stephen and I went to Mi Pueblo on Lorain Avenue this evening after reading the many 4 and 5-star reviews on Yelp and Google. It's close to home, looks good...let's go!
 
WORST MEAL EVER. I'm not kidding, Cleveland reviewers must really like bland, season-less food because both meals were awful. To start my boyfriend ordered a frozen strawberry margarita. It was a 5 on a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being the best). Barely frozen, no kick and just average compared to other Mexican joints we've gone to. We shared the Quesadilla Grande. It arrived...it was a flour tortilla stuffed with cheese and grilled on a flat top. No garnish, no lettuce, tomato or sour cream with it. Thank goodness we had the boring, liquid style salsa/red sauce to dip it in. Next up:
 
He ordered the Cheese Enchallada  Combination Platter. Once again, no flavor, tolerated it but it was also very bland. 
 
I ordered the Chicken and Cheese Gordita's. Oh, they didn't have those tonight but offered to make something similar and I can't remember the name (started with an S). They arrived and it was basically three grilled English Muffins (mexican version I assume), coated with beans, chicken that looked like and tasted like it came from a can, topped with cold grated cheese, sour cream, lettuce and tomato. I ate 3 bites and couldn't bare to eat anymore. It did taste a bit better when soaked in the red sauce that we had left over on the table. 
 
The server never asked us how the food was, just saw I wasn't eating and brought me a box. Not her fault, she just works there so she got her 20% tip.
 
We both walked away wondering ""Is this what authentic mexican food in Cleveland is"" and ""is our favorite place Nuevo Acapulco maybe Americanized Mexican food?"". I don't know. I've eaten a lot of mexican food in New Mexico with my parents and it all had flavor. I will never go back to this place. No second chance.",0
wnyMhlR5KCWkTCzQ1_gOUQ,"Oh my, Mi Pueblo I still love you, don't worry. 

I just can't say no to those salsas, pickled veggies and fresh chips. By the time I get my food, I'm stuffed on those alone. 

But yet, you cannot help but still order a delicious meal you'll never finish. This time? Oh, I went for the enchiladas rancheros. You get three, so I ordered one with cheese and two with chicken. The chicken was certainly the star of the dish--tender, a little smokey and perfectly seasoned. The rest was just OK. The red mole sauce was bitter, but when you ate it with the beans and rice, it was better. One of my dining partners had mentioned that their tomatillo sauce is way more tasty, so I'll definitely try that next time. 

The service was also a little spotty. At first, everything was great, but then it started to go downhill with really slow service. Not for our food, though--that came out fast. It was when it came time for the check that it was painfully slow. 

I will say that when I saw my check I was elated! Thirty bucks for four cocktails (don't judge) and a great meal? Wow... I guess I'm used to much more expensive drinks (and no, they weren't the neon green margaritas.) 

Overall, another great experience with delicious, authentic food that only had a couple things keeping it from 5-stars. I left so stuffed that I thought someone might have to roll me out. That's always a good sign!",1
wnyMhlR5KCWkTCzQ1_gOUQ,"Mi Pueblo was a hit with my fiance.  My opinion?  This place just isn't my style.  The day we tried Mi Pueblo I was in the mood to stuff my face with chips and salsa, chow on some cheesy enchiladas and swill some margaritas.  I knew the minute we stepped foot in the door that I was in the wrong place.  First of all, even though there were several tables filled with patrons, it was so quiet you could hear a pin drop.  I felt like everyone in the place could hear our conversation.  Speaking of, the other diners sorta bordered on the creepy side.  There was a table of older men speaking Spanish and staring at us as we ate.  I got fed up at one point and threw a stank face their way, but that didn't deter them.  My high school Spanish didn't allow me to make out what they were saying...which is probably a good thing.  But needless to say it made for an uncomfortable dining experience.  Our meals were very good.  My fiance had a pork dish that he raved about and my shredded beef tacos were delicious.  The quality of the food is what saved this review from being a 2 star-er, but Mi Pueblo isn't on my try again list based on ambiance alone.  Yeah, yeah...I know that if you want ""authentic"" sometimes you have to skip the ambiance, but that doesn't work for me.  Oh well, I guess I am just a margarita drinking-taco eating (wait, that doesn't sound right)-cheesy Americanized Mexican restaurant-loving gal.",0
wnyMhlR5KCWkTCzQ1_gOUQ,"As far as inexpensive, indigenous Mexican eats in Cleveland, it won't get any better or more authentic than at Mi Pueblo Taqueria. 

That's all. Short and too the point. I could wax poetic on the chili rellenos, the spicy salsa, the guacamole or the pickled carrots, but I don't want to muddy up the review. It's all been said before. Quite simply, this place is great.",1

wnyMhlR5KCWkTCzQ1_gOUQ,"Mi Pueblo is not only my favorite Mexican restaurant in Cleveland, it is my favorite restaurant ever. Period. And I've been going to Mexican places since I was like 4 years old. I would probably eat here every week if my girlfriend would allow it. I've been to most of the Mexican places in town(Luchita's, Maya, Don Ramon, Nuevo Acapulco, Villa y Zapata, etc.)and they all seem to have the same menu items. Mi Pueblo however, has dishes not found elsewhere. I highly recommend their steak dishes and soups. Their salsa is unique and spicy, not for the faint of heart. Service is generally good and fairly quick, though not lightning fast. Things here seem mostly made to order. I've never been south of the border so I can't speak to the authenticity of the food. The Taqueria still flies refreshingly under the radar and there is no trace of trendiness nor a hipster to found. Check out this hidden gem... stat.",1

wnyMhlR5KCWkTCzQ1_gOUQ,"And like Dick S I'm here to neutralize a negative Mi Pueblo review. 

Like Dick,  I have had Mexican food in some of the most heavily Mexican-influenced areas of the country, including SoCal, Phoenix and Tuscon.  Mi Pueblo would absolutely hold its own in any of those locations. To say my wife and I have eaten there dozens of times would not be an exaggeration in the slightest. Tonight was the first visit in a few months and I'm not kidding when I say we both looked forward to it SO much. And, as usual, it was great as great can be.  From the wonderful service (thank you Theresa and Myra!) to the yummy food to the fun and authentic atmosphere, Mi Pueblo is our go-to place for honest and delicious Mexican food.",1
wnyMhlR5KCWkTCzQ1_gOUQ,"Probably the best, most authentic Mexican you will get in Cleveland.

I have been to non-touristy parts of Mexico on a few occasions and I can say this isn't too far from what I would get there. 

The first thing you will notice is that there are actual Mexicans dining here. Always a good sign ;) The chips are great and the salsa is HOT. Just the way I like it. I imagine you can get mild, but I'm guessing you'd have to ask for ""gringo salsa"" ;)

One of my favorite dishes is the Chile Rellanos. Lots of melty cheese inside. The burritos and tacos are great as well as the chicken mole. I really haven't had a bad dish. The rice and beans can be a bit on the bland side, but still decent. The guacamole is fresh and chunky. Yum

One important note, as others have pointed out, is not to expect the same quality of food at the east side location. If you want great Mexican, this is where you want to be.",1
wnyMhlR5KCWkTCzQ1_gOUQ,"**HIDDEN GEM ALERT**

This is seriously good, authentic Mexican food.  Being an ex-Californian, this is the closest I have found to great Mex and I am one tough customer when it comes to Mex.  We usually frequent El Jalapenos in Lakewood but the quality of ingredients at Mi Pueblo is head and shoulders above El Jalapenos.  Mi Pueblo makes their own corn tortillas and they are delicious.  I ordered the Enchiladas Rancheras with cheese and they were super yummy.  The ranchera/mole sauce is killer.  Great service.  Perfectly sized and priced lunch options.  We will definitely put this place in rotation--and go to it frequently!",1
wnyMhlR5KCWkTCzQ1_gOUQ,"Like many others have said, this is easily the most delicious Mexican food I've ever had. Though I've never been to Mexico, it seems very authentic.

I've had the avocado tostadas several times. It was hard to switch and try something else, but I took the advice of several reviewers and tried the avocado tacos - yum! So simple and delicious.

My boyfriend loves the beef tongue tacos. He also enjoys the tripe, but that can be more an an acquired taste.

I don't think either of us have ever finished a complete meal. Most recently, I even ordered smaller portions a la carte and still couldn't eat everything. I did, however, really want to.

If you're drinking, beware of the large margaritas, unless you plan to stay for awhile. Basically, for the price of one standard cocktail at a fancy bar, you get a margarita the size of a fishbowl.

That being said, for my money, nothing goes better with delicious Mexican food than a Tecate with lime, salt and hot sauce.",1

wnyMhlR5KCWkTCzQ1_gOUQ,"So, Cleveland, we're 2 for 2 today.  Had a gobble and run experience @ Mi Pueblo as I was chasing a flight at the airport.  The location is down a non-descript street that seems to be in a very average city neighborhood.  The restaurant is brightly lit and clean.
Service was prompt and friendly and they more than accommodated my need to move fast with the meal.
It's an expansive menu of selections and I got the Tostada combo, which had taquitos, a soft taco and tostada along with rice, beans, guac and a salad of sorts.  Holy combo, that was a ton of food.  Add that to my lunch and I'm gonna have to run for days to get back to my pre-trip weight.
The food was decently spiced, not overly but just enough.  I would have liked a bit more seasoning, but it wasn't a detractor.  Everything was fresh, warm and tasty.
Prices were reasonable, not suuuper cheap, but not expensive either.  A good value meal that tastes authentic.",1
wnyMhlR5KCWkTCzQ1_gOUQ,"The menu was definitely authentic and and the food quality was superb. That being said, the service and atmosphere were just OK. Will probably stick to Nuevo Acapulco.",0
wnyMhlR5KCWkTCzQ1_gOUQ,"I moved here from San Diego about ten years ago. MI Pueblo is by far the best, most authentic Mexican this side of the Rio Grande. I have the Lorraine location near me but I have also been to the location in Univ. Circle. 

Their tacos are the real deal..doubled wrapped just like in Mexico..the burritos are fabulous...their salsa are spicy to most but authentic.

The Carne asada, the chilies rellenos, caldo de seven sea seas is wonderful.

There really is no place better, maybe more $$$$, but not the quality.


Even better is that they have grown so much they now have a grocery store with assorted dried peppers, a butcher shop and even a taco stand on the weekends serving 7 different types of filling including gripe for the culinary adventurous.",1
wnyMhlR5KCWkTCzQ1_gOUQ,"Been here twice now and can say without a doubt that this is the best Mexican food in Cleveland.  Not necessarily the most authentic but definitely the best TASTING Mexican food around.  

I'm a burrito fiend and I have been to too many Mexican joints around here that serve me burritos smothered in sauce with a fork and a knife on the side.  WTF is that?  A proper burrito is one I can hold with two hands and devour as I reveal the deliciousness within.  Eat a burrito with a knife and a fork?  Psh!  Who am I, J. Peterman?  With that said, props to Mi Puebla for serving me a proper burrito full of tender, juicy carnitas and just the right amount of toppings all in a perfectly warm and toasty flour tortilla.  Ay papi!  I'm not even going to lie.  This burrito literally made love to me.  And baby, I'm coming back for more.",1
wnyMhlR5KCWkTCzQ1_gOUQ,"I AM a fan of Mi Pueblo. However: I'm not its biggest fan ... yet.

I'm reluctant to write this review now, after having only a burrito and a bite of my husband's tostada. It was very good. We did takeout, so I can't speak to the entire experience, which I suspect is part of the reason why I'm not like ""OMIGOD, this place is sooooo authentic!!!!""

So I'll just focus on the food, and update later when I've been to the restaurant.

The burrito was fine. The chicken inside was FABULOUS and tender and lovely. But everything else was just ok. There wasn't much cheese or sour cream or really anything else other than chicken and refried beans. So that was a little disappointing. You know it's bad when I have to go to my fridge and bust out the greek yogurt to make it not so dry.

The tostadas were great. Full of flavor. I should have gone with something like that.

The rice was really not so special. Bland and one-note. I'm a fan of really tasty, zesty rice. This was not it. The refried beans were ok, but as a general rule I like to stay away from those.

So, the moral of the story? I don't know. I'll try it again, dining in, and then update!",0
wnyMhlR5KCWkTCzQ1_gOUQ,"Truly authentic mexican food, not that gringo stuff, and lots of it. Salsa's are house-made and not the same-ol, same old. If you like real Mexican food try this place. Only down side: dumpy location and tables are sort of cafeteria-like. Friendly and efficient staff, though they aren't so fast at clearing off tables (though when they do get around to it, that table is CLEAN!). Recommended.",1
wnyMhlR5KCWkTCzQ1_gOUQ,"Mi Pueblo is just one of those joints that has always been, and will always be, slightly overrated. It's good, sure. But it's not ""AMAZING"". More appropriate adjectives would be ""alright"" or ""A-OK"". 

The food is mostly authentic, I guess. I've eaten in Mexico and I suppose it's pretty comparable to what you'd find there. It's not your typical Americanized slop that you'd find at most other Mexican joints in town. The salsa they serve is actually salsa and not that chunky, mild garbage you expect at other establishments. 

Sadly, I think that Mi Pueblo has taken a bit of a nose-dive since I've last been there. They didn't even have guacamole due to ""running out of avocadoes"". 

Do yourself a favor and do NOT order a margarita here. Unless you like those fake, electric green, Little Hugs dranks -- stay away. I do not remember their margs being so bad in the past. I'll be smarter next time and order a beer. That sad,  godforsaken margarita was $10 too!  :(",0
wnyMhlR5KCWkTCzQ1_gOUQ,Been goin there for years.  Real authentic feel even though youll find the occasional hipster in there lately..Food is consistant.  Service is friendly but a tad slow sometimes.  Margaritas can taste like the mix and not the booze (which is why i dropped a star).  Im a big fan of the tacos.  They will even give ya more chopped cilantro if you like it as much as I do!  Also try to grocery store next door.  Produce can be a lil old though.,1

The poutine options are ridiculous in the best way possible, and while I can't speak to their authenticity, I can vouch for their tastiness. This is the stuff dreams are made of, if you dream of French fries, cheese and gravy. The only sandwich I've had so far is the po-boy and it was just as quality as the poutine. The flavor of the sausage was crazy with just the right meat-to-bun ratio. 

The other plus is the price. You won't leave hungry, sober or poor. That's a win-win in my book.",1

WvunDFSs2hJrPHVFqB6Y1w,"So i really wanted to love this place. My usual pizza joint is closed on sundays, so i searched yelp for something close. Based on pictures and other reviews i thought Brothers seemed like a good choice., unfortunately i was way off the mark, and so were most of the reviews. For those of you that said this was great pizza, you have obviously Never, Ever had real pizza. You must eat only chain pizza or gas station pizza, because Brothers is not, by any means, real, authentic, homemade pizza! The crust was worse than store bought mix that you add water to. It was soft, but heavy, which is an odd combo. It was like eating white bread with sauce on it. It was so doughy and bland, no color to the bottom, just pale. The cheese was cheap and gritty, and the toppings, ugh,the toppings. I have tried alot of pizza from all over the city, and this was almost the worst pizza i have ever had. I had 1 piece and offered the rest to a friend for her dog, and she declined. I didnt even save it for the morning munchies, it went right in the trash. I actually feel horrible about writing this review but I think people that are looking for real, authentic, homemade, quality pizza, have a right to an honest review. The only reason I gave 2 stars is because the wings I ordered were pretty good. They were jumbo and crispy. Im in no way writing this to be mean, it was just soooo bad, I cannot let it go. So if you love pre-made, gas station pizza , than this is the spot for you. If you want real pizza, mom and pop pizza, authentic pizza, than please keep looking.",0
wxMDlB4MJ65CHQVxOYm5_w,"FOOD -- I ordered the Thai Peanut bowl as a takeout order along with their chocolate chip cookie. The chocolate chip cookie was absolutely delicious. I believe it has nuts or maybe even oats inside because that is what I tasted. It is served warm. It's soft on the inside and has a chewy outside layer. It's $2 a piece. I recommend you try it. The cookie almost reminded me of famous Levain bakery cookies in NYC but nothing tops Levain plus Levain cookies are huge (haha, just read my Yelp review of Levain Bakery). Okay, unto the main dish - Thai Peanut bowl.

The Thai peanut bowl on the other hand tasted okay. When I called to order, the guy on the phone mentioned that the Thai bowl was spicy. As someone who loves spicy food, this was not spicy at all. 

The chicken and vegetables were cooked well and the pineapple added a sweet addition. The Thai peanut sauce was the real deal breaker for me. The sauce really lacked flavour and tasted bland. Of course, this restaurant isn't an authentic Thai restaurant but that doesn't mean that a $13 dish should produce a lackluster sauce. 

I was really excited to try this Thai bowl and unfortunately, it was not to my liking. I should have just gone with the other menu choice, the California bowl. For the most part, the Thai peanut bowl wasn't horrible but it just wasn't great. 

What's good about the Thai peanut bowl is that the portion size is large. Infact, I still have half of the bowl left over so now I can eat the rice for dinner (sadly, all the chicken is in my belly from lunch...haha). Also, please note, the bowl can be requested to be made vegan and some of their other bowls can be requested vegetarian. 

PRICES -- Before coming here, I thought that the price for lunch will not be more than $8 but I paid $13 for the bowl. I already knew the price before coming in but I figured that the food would taste good. As stated earlier, the bowl is large so that's good. The flavour of the Thai peanut bowl was really bland for the high price. I noticed that other items on the menu are also on the somewhat high side as well with lunch costing between $10-$15 and dinner costing between $12-$25 depending on what you buy.

INTERIOR - It has a very clean and modern look. I love the light fixtures and simple looking vibes. A quick glance at the chairs looked as if they would be comfortable but I cannot say because I didn't not sit inside. They are wooden chairs I believe.

SERVICE - This is a order at the counter type of restaurant or as I've read in earlier reviews, ""fast casual"". Chipotle and Panera have the same setup. I don't mind this type of restaurant setup at all because I choose to cash tip at the end of my meal based on my overall experience. Of course, since I did not dine in for lunch, I could not tip.

My order was correct and the gentleman who took my order over the phone was friendly. I called my order to go so I did not dine in. I called in my order at 12:15pm on a Saturday afternoon and I was told it would be ready in 5 mins which was surprisingly quick. I came inside within 10 mins after calling and my order was ready as expected. I paid then left.

Overall, I will probably be back to try 1 more menu item and hopefully it will have more flavour. The restaurant opened around the middle of last year (2018) in the Lakewood/Edgewater neighbourhood of Cleveland so I suspect that they will continue to work on their menu.

WZhI-q8IyV7ec_4kWzrSmQ,"After going to 3 other places for ground angelica and barberries, I finally hit the Persian jackpot at Assad Bakery. The owner told me all the area Farsi come to him for Persian goods.  The store also offers a diversity of Middle Eastern groceries, while one half of the store boasts a meat spit and bakery.  I ordered the chicken shawarma, and it was just about as authentic as the street food I had in Syria. Can't wait to try the shish kebabs.  Definitely check this place out!",1
WZhI-q8IyV7ec_4kWzrSmQ,"I have been on a quest to find the best middle eastern food in this city...you can tell by seeing my other reviews.  THIS PLACE IS THE BEST

I have heard alot about this place, and it doesnt get more authentic then this.  This place is a actually a bakery with an middle eastern grocery store.  They have a a nice grill area where dishes are prepared fresh.  Its a local joint, well known for it's pita bread, and it supplies pita to alot of the other middle eastern restaurants with in the nearby states.

I had there kefta kabob, beef shish, and chicken shish...and it was spot on.  The beef shish was the best I have ever ever had...it was so juicy and flavorful.  I also had some tabouli salad, which was just perfect.  And I ended it all with a nice Knafa for dessert, and this was pherhaps the best knafa I have ever had.  

This place uses the freshest ingredients, they make all sorts of things, but well known for their grilled items.  They have a bakery where they make thier own bread, and desserts.  And I have tried the food and desserts in the local area and none of them compare.  IF you real authentic, you go here.  This place is so legit, that on certain days they will make stuffed hearts....i was skeptical...but it was pherhaps better than any steak i have ever had.

This is the place for REAL ARABIC FOOD.",1
WZhI-q8IyV7ec_4kWzrSmQ,"Sort of a grocery store, sort of a bakery, and from what I could tell, not quite a restaurant - and it is all very authentic Middle Eastern.  

I was venturing downtown and needed to bring dessert to a picnic, so I routed to Assad's to check out the bakery options.  What I found was a small and super authentic grocery store specializing in middle eastern ingredients, foods, and grocery.  Bakery selection was somewhat limited - many were packaged goods - but I did see some fresh-prepared baklava and wrapped date desserts.  There was also an assortment of fresh middle eastern breads that looked tasty.  Prepared middle eastern meals were available to order behind the counter, probably for a ""to-go"" eating occasion. 

The neighborhood is not one that is up and coming / hip and trendy, so I would not necessarily feel so comfortable walking around solo, but the folks I interacted with were friendly and perhaps surprised to see a white girl in the 'hood.",1
X0mNw8owxgJXrgTBR-7Yfg,Everything here seems so authentic. My breakfast Banh Mi was flavorful and fresh.my server attentive and pleasant . I will be back when in Cleveland again.,1
X1v2lPPXgJGaIufxJHvZCA,"I think this is definitely a hidden gem. It's a tiny little place hidden in the back of the same building as superior pho. The outside is definitely a little sketch, but both of these restaurants offer authentic, well-priced, delicious foods.  In fact, it very reminscent of the various hole-in-the wall restaurants in Pusan and Seoul, and quite authentic. 

My boyfriend and I tried the hoe-dopbap, which is a selection of fish in a bed of rice. For the price, I was so surprised by the amount of fresh fish and roe that we got. It was this HUGE bowl of food that we shared. We both left well satisfied. 

They also give a cute small yogurt drink at the end of each meal. It's the perfect end to a perfect meal. 

Can't wait to come back again.",1
X1v2lPPXgJGaIufxJHvZCA,"Honestly one of the worst korean restaurants I've ever been to. I have gone to almost all Korean restaurants in Ohio and this has BY FAR been the worst. Horrible service, even when they're not busy. Confused servers. Bad food. I ordered bibimbap, NO FLAVOR. Whatsoever. Not authentic or exotic. No flavor . The bulgogi was a dish you couldn't ruin, and somehow they ruined that dish too. The only people who would like this place , are people with bland tastebuds. I recommend any other place .",0
X1v2lPPXgJGaIufxJHvZCA,"I have been here twice and it's alright, I guess it would be authentic, since the 2x I have been there its full of Koreans eating Korean food there.  I ordered the hot stone bibambop, that was okay and I have ordered the Tofu Soup, delicious, if you like soup!  Other than that it was alright nothing fancy and will definitely be coming back to get my Korean fix.",1
X1v2lPPXgJGaIufxJHvZCA,"The best Korean food in all of Cleveland. We absolutely love coming here with friends -- the food is delicious and VERY authentic Korean (I take my Korean friend here every time he visits and he says it's like eating his mother's home cooking). Pretty decent sushi, too, but I recommend ordering something different every time. It's always a hit!",1
X1v2lPPXgJGaIufxJHvZCA,"This was the most authentic Korean food I have had since I left Korea.  

While living in Korea I was eating Dol Sot Bi Bim Bop twice a week, while I cannot make it to Ha Ahn that much, the quality and authenticity is spot on (to include small tables next to huge glass windows).",1
X1v2lPPXgJGaIufxJHvZCA,"Huge portions, authentic food, and fast service.

A little light on the sides compared to the Korean restaurants I've been to in the past, but the food is great.  Kimchee tastes amazing.  Staple bibimbap was great and tastes like back in Korea.

Hard to find but I'll be coming back.",1
X1v2lPPXgJGaIufxJHvZCA,"Will definitely be back.  Went for lunch and had the tidy soup, so good.  Great service.  Lunch menu is good, not like an Americanized typical Chinese lunch specials, their lunch menu sticks to authentic Korean.",1
X1v2lPPXgJGaIufxJHvZCA,"This isn't my favorite Korean place in town, but I think it might be the most authentic: right down to the folding chairs, hand-written signage on the walls and otherwise nonexistent dÁE©cor (most restaurants I've been to in Korea are exactly like this). 

The Kimchi Jigae here is awesome! I also really liked the spicy pork and mackerel. 

Overall, if you're looking for ""tmosphere"", you won't find it in this narrow one-room place... but authentic, delicious, cheap Korean food is definitely a good reason to try it out.s",1
X1v2lPPXgJGaIufxJHvZCA,"This place is kind of small, which is why it lost one star. Other than that, the food is good and price is right. I especially like the sushi there. The sushi is authentic Korean, which is different from the Japanese one which is regular in US. The sushi tastes exactly like those I had back in Seoul. Which is wonderful. The price is good too.",1
X1v2lPPXgJGaIufxJHvZCA,"This place is a 3.5 star Korean restaurant in L.A but I was surprised to taste the authenticity in Cleveland so I'm giving an additional 0.5 stars. This place was hard to find and the owners didn't speak too much english but I enjoyed their bibimbab dish. 

I wasn't able to try too much stuff from the menu but I can confirm other yelper's claim that this place is authentic.",1
X1v2lPPXgJGaIufxJHvZCA,"I was born in Korea and raised in LA and NYC. 

Ha Ahn in Cleveland is one of the Top Five Korean restaurants I've ever been to.

Truly authentic and every ingredient seems to be of the highest quality, and incredibly fresh.",1
X1v2lPPXgJGaIufxJHvZCA,"We are visiting Cleveland, and have lunch here. It's a very authentic Korean restaurant. We liked it very much! The service is very nice!",1
X1v2lPPXgJGaIufxJHvZCA,"This is my favourite K-food venue in CLE.  
That may or may not be an impressive statement, but it's got the warmth of home in a space that feels more like a cubby than a venue.

Simple decor, however, houses pragmatic service and the punch of a home-cooked meal.",1
X1v2lPPXgJGaIufxJHvZCA,"Went here for the first time today with a friend for lunch. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of service and food. 

My friend and I each got a bento box and split the kani-su appetizer.

We loved the kani-su (crab stick and avocado wrapped in cucumber and topped with a light citrus sauce). I'm pretty adventurous and my friend is not and we both enjoyed it. 

The bento boxes were delicious and fresh. I got the sushi bento box and my friend got the sushi/sashimi bento box. It included the entree, seaweed salad, California roll, two gyoza, house salad (with a ginger lime dressing) and some white rice. The tea is complimentary and they even provide you with a little cold dessert drink (not sure what it actually is, but it tastes like a smoothie) that's complimentary, too. 

I am looking forward to going back and trying the bibimbap as it looked delicious and authentic (make sure to get the hot stone bibimbap for the full experience!). 

The reason I rated four stars instead of five is because the service was actually quite slow. Unfortunately, not doable in under an hour for lunch.",1
X1v2lPPXgJGaIufxJHvZCA,Ate here for the first time with my girlfriend and was actually quite impressed. We came for a late lunch when they were not very busy and our server was very friendly and helpful. I ordered the stir fried squid and my girlfriend ordered the bibimbap. Both of us were satisfied with our dishes and agreed that this is a place we would like to come back to revisit! I would definatly recommend this place to friends and family. The place is small but cozy with a very authentic feel.,1
X1v2lPPXgJGaIufxJHvZCA,"I'm beginning to think that Korean food is like a style of clothing that will just never fit me right--like bell-bottoms and tennis shoes. (I'm serious... I sort of look like a mutant in sneakers)

Regardless, what I'm trying to say is Korean is not my favorite Asian cuisine. I just don't jive very well with dried fish, tentacles and fish cakes. I'll eat seafood, but concentrated fishiness does not need to be a part of my life. 

With that being said, Ha Ahn serves up super-authentic and fresh Korean fare. Even though I don't prefer this style of food, there were things I thoroughly enjoyed--like the mammoth sized bowl of spicy beef and vegetable soup I ordered. Red, hot, rich broth with strips of beef, bean sprouts and other veggies. I added a little more hot sauce and it there you have it, the perfect answer to a cold, rainy night. The kimchee was deliciously spicy and those little pickles were quickly hoarded by me, of course. 

Some things I didn't like? The seafood pancake. Again, this wasn't because it was actually ""bad"", but merely because I can't bring myself to consume tentacles--and this huge pancake had loads of 'em. Couldn't handle it. I kept my distance from the dried fish and fish cakes, especially after seeing my fellow diner's facial expression when she ate one. I'll just take her word for it. 

True to authentic Korean style, we were given these sweet, little yogurt shots after our meals that were a huge hit. I don't typically like sweet, but these were tangy, ice cold and refreshing. The perfect end to a spicy meal. 

One word of advice is to not be weirded out when you seriously can't frickin' find this place. Oh yea, it's one of those ""hidden in the depths"" ""get you in pissed at your significant other 'cause you can't find the damn place and you've turned around six times"" kind of spot. When you feel like you're walking into a soul food shop, you've come to the right place. Just keep walking back until you see a tiny restaurant with green lights.",0
X1v2lPPXgJGaIufxJHvZCA,"Probably the best Korean food joint I've found (so far) in Cleveland. The place is hardly ever packed, and it has ample seating for the crowd that it seems to get.

First, the food: It's good. Probably as authentic Korean food as you'll get to encounter in the greater Cleveland area. The menu offers a variety of options, though if you (or anyone in your group) are vegan or vegetarian, you won't have a lot to choose from. The banchan (appetizers/side-dishes) are decent, though nothing extraordinary. The prices are a bit steep, enough to make it a once-in-a-while treat for me. But the portions are generous enough to make you feel that your wallet's been unfairly violated. In fact, I don't think I've ever ordered one of their jjigae (stew/casserole) or meat dishes and walked out of there without to-go boxes full of leftover (in addition to a full stomach). I suspect they may try to adjust the taste (esp. with the spiciness and the strong flavours in some of the dishes) for guests who aren't visibly Korean, but I don't know for sure. Their lunch specials are phenomenal (11 a.m. to 3 p.m., I believe).

Second, the service: It's pretty efficient, quick, and nice. While your average family-restaurant kind of service isn't to be expected, I believe the staff here will try their best to accommodate your needs and requests. Expect to use simple English.

N.B.: The way things are done here resembles your typical Korean restaurant, which means, among other things, you should feel absolutely free to call for the staff's attention if you want it. It's not considered rude; don't wait for someone to accidentally look your way. You may think your server is being rude and inattentive, but they're really not.

Third, the location: The configuration is a bit bizarre, to say the least. It's actually the one aspect of this place that I can't seem to get used to. It's a small cut in the hallway in a building that doesn't appear to house a decent Korean restaurant... Either that, or someone decided to open a business -in- the building's hallway. At any rate, if you're questioning whether you're in the right building as you walk in, you are. There is a limited number of street parking on Superior and on E 31st.",0
X1v2lPPXgJGaIufxJHvZCA,"Good authentic Korean food. A smaller restaurant, more homey feel. I've had the lunch bento box with bulgogi, sundubu, yukgaejang, and hot stone bibimbap. Comes with the little Korean side dishes (kimchi, various vegetables, steamed egg, etc). Bathrooms are kinda sketchy",1
X1v2lPPXgJGaIufxJHvZCA,"Galbi. Galbi-tang. Soft-tofu soup. Cold Noodles. Hot-stone bibimbap. Spicy Crunch roll. Kani Su. Those are my favorites.

Ha-Ahn is a cute little hole-in-the-wall place with truly authentic Korean food. I have made it a ritual to get multiple meals in at Ha Ahn every time I visit Cleveland.",1
X1v2lPPXgJGaIufxJHvZCA,"This might be the best restaurant in Cleveland.  It deserves six stars.  I have been to dozens of Korean places in Seoul, Manhattan, and L.A....and Ha Ahn was more delicious, fresh, and authentic.

The ingredients seemed to be of the highest quality.  The setting is  definitely very modest, but that is what I like about it.  A hidden gem, but well worth the trip.",1
X1v2lPPXgJGaIufxJHvZCA,"Awesome korean food! Really authentic and reasonably priced.

I've been here a few times. It definitely has that family-run vibe where not much is spent on interior- it's all about the food. Located within a shopping center that also includes superior pho. A little hidden from the main street, but plenty of parking in the adjacent lot. Very few tables- I've never seen a wait, but it has gotten crowded.

Food: If you're new to korean food, it always comes with banchan, which are a bunch of side dishes. Kimchi and pickled cucumbers are my favorite! If you want more, ask for it- it's complimentary.

Get the hot stone bibimbap! Rice, a bunch of vegetables, meat and egg. Make sure to mix it with the spicy red sauce. The hot stone keeps the bibimbap cooking, so it says warm and crisps up while you're eating it.

Other foods i can recommend- Pork bulgogi (bbq pork that's on the spicy side), Tteokbokki (chewy rice cakes in a spicy sauce) and the savory seafood pancake.

Love the strawberry soft drink that's given at the end too. nice touch :)",1
X1v2lPPXgJGaIufxJHvZCA,"Since I first moved here, this has consistently been my local go-to in Cleveland's Asiatown for tasty, authentic Korean food. I almost always get the Hot Stone Bibimbap-- make sure you really thoroughly stir up that artfully assembled bowl when it comes out for a well-distributed combination of savory meat and sautÁE©ed veggies with crispy, ever so slightly burnt rice in the spicy ssamjang sauce~ My only complaint is that they don't provide the standard sesame oil t",1
X1v2lPPXgJGaIufxJHvZCA,"This place is like a little Korean sit-down well hidden, smack in the middle of Cleveland.  From the smells, decor, to the majority of Asian patronage, while sitting here you can almost forget you are in a mid-west town.  

The food at Ha Ahn is simply put  (delicious with a true Korean flare).  Don't expect to find this place easily and don't expect to find linen service or fancy ambiance here.  You will however find a guaranteed experience to an as authentic Korean as FDA would permit.  The condiments of spicy dried fish, kimchee, pickled potato, to spicy fish cakes served with any of the bubbly piping hot brothy dishes, are a mouth watering Korean experience.  The background noise of loud Korean conversations keep you pleasantly oblivious to what might be a disturbance in other english speaking patronage.  

The ambiance is devoid of decor with simple chairs and tables,  the only cutlery to be found is a soup spoon in a paper wrapper and chopsticks.  The simplistic interior that is filled with korean spice drifting from the kitchen (this will linger on your jacket for couple days unless washed) and the patronage create its own kind unique of cultural & gastronomic experience.

One advice,  if this is your first time with Korean,  be mindful of the intense taste,  ultimately true Korean in an acquired taste.  If you like Korean,  don't leave town without eating at Ha Ahn.  You will regret it otherwise.  

One tip about finding this place - if you follow google map you will end up in front a nail salon no sign for Ha Ahn on Superior.  Enter the main entrance and you will find a small area of multiple stores, walk to the back or follow the smell.  :-)",1
x39RAjfckW2buRTZ57rKDA,"Stopped because they have a sign that says Chicago Style Hot Dogs. Not sure if they've ever been to Chicago or seen/had a true Chicago Style Dog? Poor attempt and nowhere close to what you'd expect. Bad bun, no poopy seeds. Plain relish, not the neon used. No sport peppers, they used jalapeÁE±os!!! Another miss here in Cleveland for a authentic Chicago Style Dog. My hunt will continue...",0
X6chSU0KBGHGNxZ8UH_qag,"Good concept, bad execution. Bland rice, small portions for the price. Doesn't feel authentic. However, the bubble tea is great.",0
X6chSU0KBGHGNxZ8UH_qag,"Chicken teriyaki bowl is amazing!!!! And you can DIY your own sushi. Although It is not authentic Japanese food, but very good!!! Definitely come back. The environment is very cool and nice too",1
X6chSU0KBGHGNxZ8UH_qag,"Oh my oh my oh my.  Three for the sushi, but seven for the bubble tea, one for every year that I've waited for this day to finally come.

Bubble tea is a tea and milk-based drink originally from Taiwan, with added tapioca pearls (boba).  This place has true, authentic, legit boba, from Kung Fu Tea, a bubble tea chain that is popular all along the east coast and has finally come to town.  The boba is cooked perfectly, at the right consistency, not too soft and not too chewy or doughy, and the tea is made correctly.  The KF milk tea is what you should get - it's plain black milk tea.  Milk tea does tend to be sweet - you can ask for decreased sugar.

The sushi is fine - it's slightly better than the quality of sushi you would find in a college cafeteria.  The best deal is to make your own sushi roll (8 pieces) for $7.  You can pick one fish (they only really have salmon, tuna, tempura shrimp), two vegetables, and two sauces (the eel sauce is great).  It's fast and the fish is fresh enough, and the rice is not hard and stale.  They also have teriyaki bowls.",1
X6chSU0KBGHGNxZ8UH_qag,"I'll say right up front, this is definitely not the most authentic sushi game in town so don't come for that.  What you should come for are the awesomely naughty/filling teriyaki and poke bowls, and the bubble tea.

First of all, the bubble tea menu encompasses just
About every flavor and ""type"" of tea drink you could want.  Slushie, hot tea, iced tea, juice infusion, whatever.  And there's just about every type of boba add-on you could imagine.  They even ask if you want to customize the level of sweetener and the amount of ice....talk about getting the details right.

The teriyaki and poke bowls have a myriad of options, from types of meat to sauce flavors to the ""base carb"" (white rice? Brown rice ? Udon?), veggie types, the works.  What you wind up with is a totally made-your-way bowl of deliciousness with as much meat as you could ever want and certainly leftovers if you so choose.  In no way am I suggesting the food here is particularly authentic but damn, for fast service and selection it's definitely a winner.  I'm a repeat customer for sure.",1
X6chSU0KBGHGNxZ8UH_qag,"3 stars for the sushi - it is overpriced ($7 per roll?!) and not very good. The rice descends from a new age rice pooping machine that lowers perfect squares of sushi rice onto a sheet of nori. It feels wrong and like a slap in the face to sushi chefs everywhere. The quality of seafood is clearly not fresh, and their options are limited. If you really crave sushi, it's an OK fix, but that's why it's 3 stars. It's just OK.

5 stars for bubble tea - I've been at CWRU for 4 years now and I am blessed that a King Fu Tea opened on campus in my 3rd year. I actually probably shouted profanities to the sky, thanking god for answering my prayers. It's good... like really good... so good that it's worth spending $4 on a fruity drink that you eventually have to chew. 

4 stars for teriyaki bowl - portions are big and competitive as a ""lunch and dinner"" type of meal. It's definitely very rice heavy, hence the 4 stars, and there are no dietary considerations so my gluten free friends can't have a teriyaki bowl. To be honest, the food is far from authentic. What Tex Mex is to mexican food, the teriyaki bowl is to Japanese food. However, it's such good value for the money that you can't help but go back.

Go for the bubble tea, return for the bubble tea, and if you're hungry, get the rice bowl and not the sushi.",1
xAbGtOHkdp3khmSpEGgkZg,"Good- for what it is. 

I think most disappointed reviewers are expecting authentic bibimbap- which is super flavorful with unique textural elements from the hot stone bowl... I know that's what I was hoping for based on the name... Instead, this place is what many people have referred to as the Korean chipotle....

You don't go to Chipotle looking for authentic Mexican food... similarly, this place won't feed your cravings for authentic Korean cuisine. But it's all right for what it is: a quick bowl of Korean-ish style food. 

Does anybody know of a place to get delicious authentic bibimbap around here?? I'm still looking.",1
xAbGtOHkdp3khmSpEGgkZg,A very modern looking restaurant. I had a free coupon. It is similar to Chipotle style when you order. I liked the food but more of a fast food vibe than authentic asian food. I like that it was on the healthier side. They serve complimentary miso soup but it was not very good and more bland.,1
xAbGtOHkdp3khmSpEGgkZg,"Not a bad spot at all. This was also super affordable, given how generous the workers were when building my bowl.

BIBIBOP is close to UCity, which is nice if you're living near CRWU. I wanted something healthier for dinner while I was staying nearby Cleveland Clinic, so I didn't mind walking down here to pick up some food. BIBIBOP's menu is definitely Korean-influenced, the concept being that you get to create your own bibimbop bowl. Some of the food items are non-traditional (for instance, the black beans and kale), but I was impressed that the flavors of sesame oil and gochujang were actually spot-on. I decided to include in my bowl a mixed green base, spicy chicken, potatoes, bean sprouts, kimchi, kale, carrots, egg, cucumber, and yum yum sauce. I loved that they didn't charge extra, even though I asked for extras on some of my toppings. I also liked that I paid only $7 for my entire meal. 

The only *very minor* criticism I have is that BIBIBOP would not be a great place for me if I'm in the mood for authentic Korean food. Otherwise, I actually liked my meal a lot. Now I wish they had a place back in San Francisco (which is where I'm originally from).",1
xAbGtOHkdp3khmSpEGgkZg,"I had had absolutely low expectations for the food here, and it served me well. If you come in expecting a Korean Chipotle, with the appropriate amount of authenticity, then you're good to go!

I was the only one in line, but the staff here rushed rushed me to the checkout line - felt unsettling. I came around 2pm at a non-peak time, and  dined in. I was trying to enjoy a nice lunch, when I  some trendy music started playing. The three or four employees in the back proceeded to screech and start dancing in the back, and making a ruckus. All 6 of us diners stopped to eat and stared at them for a good 5 minutes until they started settling down. I'm glad they had fun, but that was extremely  unprofessional. 

As for the food itself, most of the flavor is carried by the various sauces they squirt onto the dish. I had requested their original flavor, and they dumped a good amount in my bowl in one quick, smooth action. Had I known, I would have asked for 1/4 the amount of sauce. 

Next time I would order takeout, 1/4 the sauce.",0
xAbGtOHkdp3khmSpEGgkZg,"Many of my fellow friends suggested this place to me, and it seemed interesting considering it's a new Asian grille added onto university circle strip of food stores. 

 The service line reminded me of chipotle, but like a Asian version of chipotle. I wasn't impressed, the hype was not that great.

I'll take a authentic bibbop over Asian grille, overall I did enjoy it and wanted to taste their ""free miso soup"" but they did not have any. 

Preparation could be better.",0
xAbGtOHkdp3khmSpEGgkZg,"Is this the most authentic Korean food in the land? No. Is this the most delicious and mind-blowing food in Cleveland? Not exactly. Is it the best price-to-tasty/quantity ratio. ABSOLUTELY!!!

This spot really plays to its strengths. Fast service, great environment, tasty food and very favorable in regards to getting the most bang for your buck to the customer. I got an insane amount of food in my bowl for only $7.00! 

Here's what I would recommend. When you and your friends or significant other are in the never-ending exchange of ""what do you want to eat? - I dunno, what are you in the mood for?"", just go to Bibibop cause it has something for everyone at the right p'rice'. 

The only reason it is not 5 stars is because I feel like there is definitely some un-reached, yet obtainable level of flavor potential that has not been achieved. 

Have fun and I hope your experience will be as good as mine was!",1
xAbGtOHkdp3khmSpEGgkZg,"I desperately want this place to be better than it is because I've been to amazing restaurants set up in a similar fashion with Korean cuisine and this franchise I just like I don't really understand. 

The toppings are like somewhat Korean but very tame for example the seasonal item of spinach was literally raw spinach and sesame oil... I have had spinach bibimbap sides before and they are extremely flavorful and good- so it just sucks when you come here with that expectation.

 I feel like this is a great place for an introduction to people to Korean cuisine but if you actually like korean, it's not really going to cut it.

i came in on the last day of their free bowl option on their app and that is the only reason why. I ordered  a salad with spicy chicken and asked for extra lettuce. there was maybe like 1/4 cup of romaine, was mostly sopping juice from the kimchi. free miso is a plus- but the miso is also not very good. 

I would go here again in a pinch, or if i got another free bowl, but overall just not very impressive and I really feel like they could be so much better if they were more authentic with their flavors and offerings. (like why is cheese a topping ever and not like shiitake mushrooms I don't understand)",0
xAbGtOHkdp3khmSpEGgkZg,"I'm a fan of this place because it has healthy options and it's pretty tasty. I am also Korean, and although it can't compare to the authentic, homemade food I get at home, it's still a quick, tasty fix. I have had Korean food that is 100x better, but that doesn't mean a small bowl of this can't satisfy a little Korean food craving.",1
xAbGtOHkdp3khmSpEGgkZg,"This is a great healthy lunch or dinner option in Cleveland. It is located on the Case Western Reserve University campus in the University Circle neighbourhood. This area of Euclid Ave. is filled with new apartment buildings and plenty of food options. 

I first visited Bibibop in Columbus (Ohio) about 3 years ago when my mom got some free food at an event and told me about the purple rice. I was intrigued about the purple rice but ended up loving what I tasted.

FOOD -- Super fresh and delicious. Everything comes in a small or large bowl. You first choose a base (greens such as lettuce or mixed greens, white rice, purple rice, or noodles). Then you pick hot toppings, a protein, and finally a sauce. The hot toppings are potatoes, bean sprouts, or black beans. Protein options are tofu, chicken, spicy chicken, and steak. There are also cold topping options such as kale, carrots, corn, etc.

I came here before a Yelp event on 14 March 2019 and I arrived with fellow Yelper (Ilona P.) around 6:10pm. I ordered a small rice bowl with spicy chicken. I added cold toppings - corn, red cabbage, kimchi, kale, cucumbers, and carrots to my bowl. I enjoyed my dinner and appreciate that I could add as many toppings as I wanted without getting charged extra. I got some sauces on the side but they can add the sauces for you as well as you order.

FREE MISO SOUP is given with every meal. All you do is grab some soup located at the end of the checkout counter.

FOOD TYPE -- Alot of comments seem to be sensitive or angry that this place doesn't have authentic Korean food. Personally, in my opinion, I don't think this is meant to be authentic Korean food but I don't care too much because the food to me is delicious. I believe the owner created Bibibop as a quick and healthy food option that slightly mimics Korean food. There is nothing wrong with this food concept since so many other places have Westernised their food types to appeal to consumers - examples include Chipotle (Mexican), Piada Street Food (Italian), and Panda Express (Chinese). 

PRICE -- A large bowl is $7.49 and a small bowl is $6.49. The price is fair considering all the toppings that can be added to your bowl.

SERVICE -- The employees I encountered were nice and fast in serving my bowl. 

The food here is tasty and super fresh. They serve nothing new or spectacular but I still love it. It is similar to Chipotle but about $1 cheaper than Chipotle and they offer more vegetables than Chipotle.

I will be back and I recommend you visit.

XBRCMc3rcvcRXrB3p-o9yA,"Wow, what a lovely place. I was aware of this before our trip to Cleveland, as my heritage is Magyar (Hungarian) and I was checking out places we may want to visit. I had not intended on driving out of downtown for this place, we were going to make a stop at the R&R Hall of Fame, however, after spending a lovely morning with the ladies at the Cleveland Hungary Heritage Society Museum, we were in the mood for it. They highly recommended the place, and I'm so glad we decided to take their advice.

This was about a 15-20 minute drive from downtown. It could potentially be faster as it is only about 6 miles away, but there was a lot of construction on the way and on Shaker street, where we ran into some detours. On the way there you will drive through some neighborhoods that look a little down, or just working on a turn around, but don't let that discourage you.

The restaurant is located on Shaker Square, which is a lovely area with some small shops and restaurants. There is a good amount of on street parking, but you will need some quarters for the meter (1 quarter=30 min.) The store front looks a little sleepy, at first I was worried it wasn't open, but when we opened the door we found a good amount of people seated, enjoying their meals; we went for lunch about 1pm.

We were greeted promptly and a table was set up for us. We only waited a few minutes between our arrival and being seated to be asked about drinks. All of the staff we encountered was welcoming and eager to please. Very interested in how we found out about the place, as well as finding out about our shared heritage. The person who spent the most time with us was a blond with very, very short hair who was more than happy to talk to us about her cooking, offer some tips, and direct us to a little Italian store that happens to have some Hungarian products available. She made us feel very welcome.

Now for the food...really, really good! It was great to see so many authentic options on the menu: starters, entrees, desserts, etc...and while my mother and I are both born and raised in the US, with our trips to Hungary and having Hungarian heritage on both sides of my family, we've had a good amount of this type of food. This was as good as anything we have had when in Budapest. They also some Hungarian wines on the menu too, my mother had the furmint, and they have Tokaji aszz, which is known as 'The king of wines, the wine of kings.'

For a starter my mother got the cucumber salad. A favorite of both of us, but something we don't make nearly enough of. They use an english cucumber and slice it wafer thin, as much water as possible is removed and it is put in some rice vinegar, sugar, paprika and some garlic on it. Served with some sour cream. Really nice take on it.

My starter was the beef goulash soup. I generally prefer my beef and veggies to but cut a little smaller so that I don't have to bite things in half and so that I get some of each ingredient in every bite...aside from that, it was fantastic as well. Mild flavor in terms of spice, although I would imagine you could ask for it a little hotter if needed. I generally like it hotter, but I was happy with the taste. The mini dumplings in it were tender. 

My mother's entree was a small order of stuffed cabbage which can come with dumplings or mashed potato. She went with the potato, which was awesome when you had some of the delightful sauce on it! The sauce for the cabbage was so flavorful, perhaps the best I've ever had. It only had the slightest amount of tomato in it, and I'm imagining my mom will try and make it this way as well.

My entree was the potato pancakes, smal",1
XBRCMc3rcvcRXrB3p-o9yA,"I came to Balaton with my daughter for dessert.  Making a selection was difficult, partly because of so many good choices but also because the choices were of an Hungarian authenticity that made them unfamiliar.  My daughter avows that the texture of dobosh torte was just right.  The desserts were lovely and delicious.  The decor and service were charming.  

After observing the various dishes being served, we will be back for dinner.",1
XBRCMc3rcvcRXrB3p-o9yA,This was the perfect place for date night. We ordered the Hungarian platter and had a sample of three dishes. We also had the amazing chocolate cake! So authentic I can't remember the Hungarian name. Haha. They were all amazing!! The convenient across the street location from the shaker movie theater makes this a great date night location.,1
XBRCMc3rcvcRXrB3p-o9yA,"We come here EVERY time we're back in Cleveland with my family~its become tradition to come here to celebrate birthday's as well. It's an authentic Hungarian restauant set in quaint Shaker Square. 

I always get the chicken shnitzel (or weiner shnitzel) with dumplings- yum! Always sub your salad for the cucumer salad. And of course you must dine with some Hungarian wine. For dessert, finish off with the chesnut puree, topped with whipped cream! You'll feel like your in Hungary here!",1
XBRCMc3rcvcRXrB3p-o9yA,"Had dinner on July 30 with 2 others.  I know the cuisine first-hand (I am a Budapest native).  The veal (borju) and nokkedli (like spatzle) were excellent; the servings were very large.  Bread was inferior.  Cucumber (uborka) salad was excellent.  The cuisine is authentic.  Service was good.  Balaton is for those who enjoy really good cooking, but it is not for calorie-watchers!  I had a bottle of Sam Adams -- this was a beer meal, not a wine meal, so I wish they had draft micro-brews.  Recommend.",1
XBRCMc3rcvcRXrB3p-o9yA,"Im Hungarian from Budapest and my mother in law lives around the corner from Balaton. When we come to Cleveland we always make sure to stop there, and I can say that it is truly authentic, spectacular Magyar food, exactly like back home. And the owners are lovely. Thank you and highly recommend!",1
XBRCMc3rcvcRXrB3p-o9yA,"This place is awesome! Delicious, authentic food and excellent custom service. Highly recommend!!",1
XBRCMc3rcvcRXrB3p-o9yA,"Good authentic hungarian food. Luved the nice friendly atmosphere. The food and wine selections were amazing. Service was very good . Enjoyed hanging out with friends. Will most definitely come back. Highly recommend this place for good authentic hungarian cuisines.
Thx

XBRCMc3rcvcRXrB3p-o9yA,I loved it. Finally langosh how it should be. And stuffed cabage was the best I had in years! From first bite everything was so delicious. Thank you so much bringing this authentic cooking to the New World!,1
XBRCMc3rcvcRXrB3p-o9yA,"If you are in the Cleveland area and have a taste for authentic Hungarian food . Run don't walk to Balatons . I have had most of their menu and can say I've never been disappointed. It's not fancy smancy inside but who cares the food is awesome.
Be ready to loosen your belt.",1
XBRCMc3rcvcRXrB3p-o9yA,"A family favorite since they were located on Buckeye...I will always love the Balaton. Also, this is one local Hungarian restaurant my Grandmother did not get into an argument with the cook over authenticity. A story for another time...

As far as Hungarian meals go there really is no question that this is the best you will find in Cleveland. Portions are huge and easy to share or take home for tomorrow's leftovers!! I'm skipping right to the main dish. Sure the Potato Pancakes, Goulash Soup and the Cucumber salad are good, but you know you are going there-for one thing and one thing only. The main attraction. The Wiener Schnitzel is on the House Specialties list for a reason. It is battered and fried to perfection and the speatzels don't come in some wimpy portion size. Comes w/the perfect amount!! The Chicken Paprikash...tho isn't my grandma's...is pretty darn close and the dumplings are a must. My 3rd pick would be the Hungarian Goulash. Really you can't go wrong here!! WAIT! Did you save room for desert?? I think over time I have had almost everything on the dessert menu. Can't seem to remember a miss yet...

A family run establishment since the 1960's will soon win you over. Oh! Don't forget to say hello to the owner...who is usually seated in the back.",1
XBRCMc3rcvcRXrB3p-o9yA,"This place is the real deal. I prefer my own Hungarian cooking, but that's because it isn't *quite* as authentic. LangÁE³s, chicken paprika, sweet pickled cucumber salad, palacsinta with dios or tÁEºro, rÁE©tes, bÁE©gli, this place has it all. And the owners are sweet. It feels like sitting down in one of the hillside ÁE©teremek overlooking the danube. Great location. Great for families. But be forewarned: Hungarian food is HEAVY. Now go!",1
XBRCMc3rcvcRXrB3p-o9yA,"We wanted to find some good ethnic food on an art-centered visit to Cleveland, and we were not disappointed in Balaton. I'm not of Hungarian extraction, so I can't speak to how ""authentic"" the food is, but it's really good--not haute cuisine, but like a really talented home cook would make. I had the pork goulash, which was flavorful and satisfying. The pieces of pork fell apart at the touch of the fork, and were well-trimmed (So many restaurants are careless about serving fatty, gristley meat.) Cabbage, onions and sauerkraut gave the dish a rounded, earthy element, and the sauce was redolent of paprika. (The paprika tasted toasted, but not burned--another mistake I often find in paprikash preparations.) The dumplings soaked up the gravy, and had a proper bit of tooth to them.

A (good) warning: I am a big eater, and I was starving when we clocked in at Balaton after 1:00. I ordered the small portion, and left 1/3 on my plate. I can't even imagine who could eat their ""large"" portions.

The restaurant was super clean, comfortable, and the service was efficient and friendly. I will return to Balaton for my next Hungarian food fix.",1
XBRCMc3rcvcRXrB3p-o9yA,"A rare family-run, non-chain place - what my Hungarian mother would have cooked, had I had a Hungarian mother. Hearty portions, authentic tastes and atmosphere. The chicken paprikash is the best you can get this side of Lake Balaton. We say Igen!",1
XBRCMc3rcvcRXrB3p-o9yA,"First time in Ohio and we decided to check out this place. It was the best decision we made! The staff was super friendly! We had a young woman with short blonde hair and she was such a sweetheart. The whole setting...food, people, decor was very authentic to the culture. 

Food was AMAZING. I can't remember exactly what we got but it was so delicious. I remember the stuff cabbage.... oh myyyyyy! So good! Dessert was amazing as well. Chocolate cake with hard caramel on top! 

Definitely worth the money you spend..... wish we had something like this in West Chester, because I don't know when I'll ever be back in Cleveland!",1
XBRCMc3rcvcRXrB3p-o9yA,"This Hungarian classic restaurant is now located in Shaker Square in Cleveland, Ohio where it moved from Buckeye Road.  The portions are large and the food is authentic but lacks the kind of home made flavor one would expect.  The atmosphere is similar to entering a relative's home and is punctuated with homey furniture and tchotchke.  I wish the food had been better but unfortunately, the flavors were indistinguishable in both the stuffed cabbage and the chicken paprikash.  Remembering the Balaton from years ago, I was disappointed that the food had not retained it's former lushness.  Prices are fairly low especially considering the amount of food presented but sometimes less is more.  I'd much rather have less food with more quality any day.",0
XBRCMc3rcvcRXrB3p-o9yA,"Wonderful Hungarian restaurant with authentic dishes, portions sizes are huge and tastes just like my grandmother was to make.",1
XBRCMc3rcvcRXrB3p-o9yA,"I spent 10 days eating in Budapest, so I feel qualified to comment on the authenticity and excellence of this establishment. Balaton is great!

Potato pancakes ($7.95) are an excellent appetizer, crispy wonderful served with sour cream. Ask about cherry juice. It goes well with the food here.

Order the Wiener Schnitzel ($21.95 large/$16.95 small) or Veal Crepes a la Hortobagy ($17.95). I also love their Stuffed Cabbage rolls ($15.95).

The schnitzel is tender and thin inside, carefully breaded and crisp fried outside. The veal crepes Hortobagy are absolutely delicious - hot savory, pancakes filled with tender veal and smothered in creamy, rich paprikash sauce.

The homemade dumplings or Speatzels here are fantastic. Fresh, tender and beautifully complemented by the sauce and the meats. ($3.95 as a side)

Portions are large. If you cannot decide what to order, try smaller appetizer portions of the entrees or have a combination plate. This will help you save room for dessert, which you should because the Hungarian strudel is really quite lovely.  ($3.50)",1
XBRCMc3rcvcRXrB3p-o9yA,"Fantastic authentic Hungarian that has been around for decades and won all sorts of awards. Started with good homemade bread followed by skippable salad. I had the chicken schnitzel and my friend had the beef goulash, and both served with spaetzle (sp?) and great. Friendly service (though because everything is homemade it's not quick)",1
XBRCMc3rcvcRXrB3p-o9yA,"Balaton quite simply is a timeless classic. It is a magical family run restaurant where the food is cooked with love. Located in the classy Shaker Square, Balaton is a step back in time. The dining room shouts old world charm with an understated but warm decor. 

I went with my Dad for a pre-fathers day meal. It was a rainy evening. Inside one could see that there were regulars. Immediately, one could hear a pounding sound in the kitchen. There was no fighting in the kitchen. Rather, the veal for the Weiner Schnitzel was pounded out of love. 

Most meals have a small and a regular portion. Even the small portion is plenty to fill you up. The regular portions look like they belong on a man vs. food eating contest. I would suggest that unless your appetite is extreme or you want to take food home that you order the small portions. I ordered the small Weiner Schnitzel meal for $19. This $19.99 includes homemade bread at the table, a side dish and a fresh salad right before dinner. This is a tremendous value! 

I ordered the chicken noodle soup. They have a soup of the day that they rotate with. The chicken noodle soup was made with a love and attention to detail that was only matched by my Jewish grandmother. The chicken was of extremely high quality. The broth had a well balanced, smooth flavor. This is probably one of the top 3 chicken noodle soups that I had in my life. 

The house salad had a light vinegary dressing and made of sufficient quality greens. While this salad wasn't particularly remarkable, it did the job as a nice filler before the actual meal. 

I was advised by a regular to order the Weiner Schnitzel. This appears to be what made them famous in the first place- for good reason. The veal was done to perfection. Often there is difficulty in striking a balance between the breading and the meat. This Weiner Schnitzel managed to be filling with a breading that was light enough to not overfill your stomach. I got the Weiner Schnitzel with the spatzlae. 

My father got the stuffed cabbage. In tasting his dinner, the beef was very well seasoned and the cabbage had a nice sour touch. 

Upon leaving, the family that ran the restaurant checked in on us and then sat together and enjoyed their meal as a family. 

This restaurant is truly exceptional in every regard. It manages to be authentic, full of love and more importantly a tremendous value.",1
XBRCMc3rcvcRXrB3p-o9yA,"I was looking for authentic Hungarian food, and this place was highly recommended. It was delicious. I've never had authentic Hungarian, and I was blown away by the flavors. I had the stuffed cabbage. I wish I lived in Cleveland, because I'd come back more often. Our waitress was very nice. We didn't have a reservation (highly recommended), they found a table for us. They made a point to take our order before a large group to keep us from waiting. Two complete meals for under $40. Food is great. I can't wait to visit Cleveland again.",1
XBRCMc3rcvcRXrB3p-o9yA,"Went there today for dinner with my wife, and my son from Kent State
Met us there.  It is beyond 5 stars, and having been there before, it still puts out authentic Hungarian food, from owners that grew up in Hungary.
My wife was born there, and if you live anywhere near here, go and 
Enjoy amazing food, and desserts.
Perfect food, amazingly wonderful owners, and worth every penny.",1
XcQKsEUlh1W0R4iXbTA1Yg,"My fiance and I went to Dervish Grill for the first time last night and we both woke up saying ""oh my god I would eat there again today."" We both LOVE Mediterranean food, but when we moved to Cleveland (we are from Toledo which is packed full of Mediterranean restaurants) we had a hard time finding those types of restaurants....at least ones that served you authentic dishes that weren't packed full of salt. This place is the real deal!

Our service was perfect and the restaurant itself is lovely for date nights. I ordered the Mediterranean Salad and added Gyro meat,  and my fiance ordered the Lamb Saute with fresh veggies and rice. Both were delicious. Totally forgot to mention that we started our meal with an order of Baba Ganush that came with fresh bread and it was insanely good.  We will be coming back here once a week for sure! Do yourself a favor and give Dervish a try!!

I will take pictures next time I stop in!",1
XcQKsEUlh1W0R4iXbTA1Yg,"Generous dinner portion of Gyro meat, Yogurt, Pita, Turkish wine, Turkish coffee. Reasonably priced and we were full after wards.  I don't know what home cooked Turkish food tastes like but seems authentic to me.  Everything tasted great also.  Great service twice now coming here.  We like to come here drink the Turkish coffee and ""try"" to read our fortunes from the coffee grounds that remain.  My last fortune from the coffee based on friends reading: I was going to travel somewhere far away.  It also showed a cliff that I may falling off or something in my life is going to have a great crash. I'll need to come back to see if my fortune has changed or if I can get a better interpreter.  Great spot in Tremont. You need to try this place out if you are in the neighborhood.  This place is in my top 10 in Cleveland for food, service, and atmosphere.",1
XcQKsEUlh1W0R4iXbTA1Yg,"My boyfriend's Lebanese and his mom cooks amazing authentic food.  Neither of us had even heard of the Dervish Grill until I was looking through local coupon offers.  We bought $40 of food for $20, got another couple, and made reservations for that night (last Saturday 9/14) @ 7:30.  We arrived early and had drinks and an appetizer at the bar.  First impression was very good - very nice employees and very warm, nicely decorated inside.  Very good bar selection (I drink Belvedere and my boyfriend a light beer) with hummus appetizer.  The hummus was the best I've had anywhere.  For dinner we ordered the stuffed cabbage and chicken kebabs and both were excellent.  We have happily found one of the best Mediterranean restaurants in Cleveland and have plans to return in the near future.",1
xDnkfWCyaUdR6iMoxnuWyg,"Ambiance: Came here with some friends around brunch on a weekend and the line was already 7 parties long. There's not a ton of waiting room and only 3-4 seats right by the counter so some people were waiting in their cars. The staff did their best to facilitate things by giving our menus for people to mark what they wanted before getting seated and they did turn over the tables very quickly. We ended up waiting probably 3-40 minutes with 4 people since they only have 2 large tables. Once we got seated things were great, service was friendly and efficient and we never felt rushed except by the sight of people starving in line :P

Food: We got the spicy quail eggs to start and while they are small, they're are very flavorful and savory with perfectly soft-boiled interiors. It was great for setting a savory tone to the rest of the meal. The special fried chicken wings are breaded with cornstarch which gives it a lighter fry but otherwise they were not that special at all. In terms of soups, we got two from the signature soups and the spicy 'crossing the bridge' soup. For the curious and confused, 'crossing the bridge' soup is a local dish of Yunnan province characterized by assembling the soup right before eating it (at table side) and typically having a layer of oil on top to insulate the broth. It's named after a story tied to the dish and not necessarily to its flavor profile although chicken, rice noodles, and Chinese vegetables are traditional. 

The broths were overall very savory and rich but still light enough you don't need to coma afterwards. The spicy broth was very tasty, like a spicer version of hot and sour soup but the heat doesn't really build so it's manageable. It was personally my favorite because it was the most complex broth. The signature broth, on the other hand, is very mellow and comforting like chicken noodle soup. We added beef slices to our bowls which was quite enjoyable but the dishes were well-composed such that it wouldn't be necessary. My wife got the stuffed meatballs which were very savory and fun, definitely worth a try just for the experience of it as I've never had ones like it before in all my travels. We ended with the pumpkin red bean pancakes which were perfectly fried and only had a mild pumpkin flavor. 

Overall I had a great experience here and would gladly bring other people here to try out one of the most authentic asian noodle experiences in Cleveland. Just be prepared for a wait if you have a large party!",1
xDnkfWCyaUdR6iMoxnuWyg,"I've been waiting with bated breath for Dagu to open... finally!!!

We came on a Thursday evening and it was jam packed. Luckily table turn over was fast so we were seated in a timely manner. 

The last time I've had Crossing Bridge noodles was when I was a child in China, so I can't say with certainty the authenticity of the flavor profile - but I can attest to the beautifully flavored broth as one of the best in the city. Like other reviewers have mentioned, the A's are pre made for you and B's you add ingredients to as you see fit. I think the A's are better from a flavor standpoint (lest you like the novelty of throwing in your own green onions). Noodles can be refilled to finish up that heavenly broth. 

Ingredients are fresh, service expedient, and I cannot worship the broth enough. The price is a bit high for amount of meat they give you, especially for Cleveland Asian town. BUT, having said that, I think it's still worth it for the (you guessed it!) broth.",1
xDnkfWCyaUdR6iMoxnuWyg,"nice space... open kitchen concept, very clean ... even the bathrooms! 

I found the check off menu confusing... but the to-go menu, available at the counter, visually helps you understand the concept/offerings. I've tried three different broths; mushroom, tomato and the spicy ""crossing the bridge"". Each are good on their own... they are served HOT and either they have their extras in already or you add from the little accompanying bowls. I found the quail egg to be the gem in the soup! Next time will be the pork chop or the bone-in beef noodle bowls... almost every other table was enjoying them... now I'm curious! 

A great place to try an authentic noodle shop, just as you would in China. I prefer to park on the side street or on Payne... the lot is very tight. This Chinese chain is very big in China and Cleveland is their second US location.",1
xDnkfWCyaUdR6iMoxnuWyg,"Great recent addition to AsiaTown right next door to Koko Bakery! We got their two signature bowls, the A1 Braised Bone-In Pork and B1 Crossing the Bridge, which have similar components except everything on A is eaten as served, while B menu items come with small trays of ingredients that you add yourself to the simmering hot bowl once it gets to the table. 

This place is essentially hotpot-style, except instead of burners for a constant heat source, your order comes out in clay(?) bowls surrounded by a protective heat-resistant container with the broth served at an extremely hot 300 degrees F! The bowls are pretty massive so consider sitting next to each other instead of across for a more comfy dining experience, esp if you order from the B menu with the big spread of side ingredients.   

All of their broths are pork-bone based (except the tomato one) with no added MSG, tasting flavorful and clean just like a hearty, home-cooked meal : ) We also got the spicy braised beef shank appetizer, which could have been a bit more tender and actually spicy imo but was nonetheless a tasty and flavorful addition to my B1, that didn't come with any meat. 

Prob the best thing about Dagu is that you can ask for a complimentary rice noodle refill to take home with your leftover broth, which for me is enough to make an entire second meal the next day! 

As delicious and filling as this was on a summer night, I can already see this place easily becoming a winter staple for me and I'll definitely be back to try the tomato soup.",1
xDnkfWCyaUdR6iMoxnuWyg,"What a great addition to Asia town! Free lot parking on site. One of the more authentic takes on soup noodles I've had in Cleveland. It's a pretty small space so it can get crowded easily if there are big parties there. 

You fill out a scantron to order. I usually dont get extra additions because the base soup already comes with so many goodies. In Section A, all the extra ingredients are already in the soup. In Section B, the ingredients come separately so you can add it yourself. I always get A1 or A4 depending on if I want beef or pork. I'd also highly recommend asking for hot sauce to enhance the flavor. Also, you get a FREE refill on noodles if you ask!

My one criticism of this place is the lack of consistency of the amount of meat in each meal. It's always delicious but sometimes it'll be two pork ribs that is hard to get the meat off, sometimes it's a huge single bone. I just wish that could be more predictable.",1
xDnkfWCyaUdR6iMoxnuWyg,"Finally it doesn't always have to be Pho, authentic Chinese noodle is the best, I tried a new drink every time I come, hard to pick the bet, they are all so good.",1
Xg_eCdx99z5Y1oTLimniOw,"This place is amazing. Fresh food at such an incredible price... and in such a great neighborhood. It's got some pretty authentic type Lebanese stuff with lots of options, many healthy. Some might not be super healthy- like the spicy fried cauliflower, or the zaatar fries- but they're soooooo good. I'm thinking that if you pay the couple dollars for one of their healthy smoothies that you're good to go. My kids beg for them whenever we're in Ohio City, which is great (cheaper AND healthier than Mitchell's ice cream down the street... though we have to do that every so often).",1
xGHbSbvng-vXV6i9ePOcgA,"There are few places that are as authentic as Farkas when it comes to Hungarian baked goods. The Napoleons that everyone raves about are their signature item, but the Linzers, Dobos Torte and Lemon Squares mean there's a little something you can indulge in every week of the year! Within a mile of downtown, right on Lorain Ave., within a block of the Westside Market and the RTA stop, with plenty of parking available, could it be any more convenient?",1
xGHbSbvng-vXV6i9ePOcgA,"As a Hungarian I was excited to find this pastry shop. The desserts are good, while they are not as authentic as you may have in a cafe in Budapest or in the kitchen of a Hungarian granny they are good.  I've tried the biscuits several times (just to give them a chance) and they are always too dry and flavorless, the dobos torte is tasty but the topping is frosting not the traditional carmely/candy hard top, the layers on their Gerbeaud are significantly thicker than the traditional desert, the Napoleons are absolutely delicious.  The flavor in the deserts are on point but they lack finesse. The people who work there are always very friendly and kind.",1
xGHbSbvng-vXV6i9ePOcgA,Truly the very BEST Napoleon you will ever taste!! Wonderful fresh authentic pastries and a friendly staff!!,1
xGHbSbvng-vXV6i9ePOcgA,"Delicious nut rolls, like the ones we were having for Christmas or Easter while growing up in Hungary. Now we live in Virginia and so had Mike mail to us a few nut rolls and pogacsa. We were impressed by the authenticity of these pastries. We had just one problem, not with the pastries themselves, but rather with Mike, who somehow dealt very unprofessionally with us. Unthinkable, as the owner, he could talk with us the way he did, leaving us in the end with a bitter...taste.",1
xGHbSbvng-vXV6i9ePOcgA,"Classic Austrian/Hungarian pastries like my grandmothers and their friends made. Those Napoleons are amazing because they're ""Krem Schnitten"", an Austrian version with a pastry cream layer. These are the best pastries in Cleveland! The Linzer squares are as good as my mom's (and hers are great). One small quibble, the Pogacz (hungarian cracklin' biscuits) although authentically made, need salt. Get them anyway and sprinkle a little on. They don't need butter! 
Go! Eat! You won't be disappointed",1
XgUlUmrktr2Um2gczYeYpg,"I went back yesterday to try this little place, and was pleasantly surprised when I found the manager chatting merrily with a mandarin speaking couple.  Evidently, you can become friends with him, it just might take time.

This trip added the Ma-po tofu and a garlic sesame oil seasoned vegetable dish to my set of experiences.  Not bad, Solid B+ effort.  The Ma po tofu wasn't very spicy, nor numbing, but it had both pepper and pepper corn.  I would prefer really red with spice, but ... I'm not getting it at most Taiwanese places.  

While mild, it still was flavourful, and I would order again.  For my tastes, this was the best mapo tofu I've had in CLE.  (Where's Peter Chang?!!!!)

The vegetable dish could have been a little less salty, but it was authentic.  To order fresh vegetables, I just ask for whatever they have fresh, and comment to the effect of ... ""less oil, please"".  This works pretty well at all chinese restaurants, by the way.

The service leaves something to be desired, but look through the service, and enjoy the meals.. .the food quality is not bad at all...",1
XHUGoHv5mP1zsgloxI-Oig,Awesome place with very authentic Argentinian meals.  We had great service and I loved the atmosphere.  This may be the best restaurant in downtown Cleveland,1
XJE_gq0I1Na0kkrGEgxq9A,"what a gem in the middle of downtown! uh may zing!!!!
fresh pita, incredible falafel, wow the shwarma is killer.
such a fun place, authentic, ya all gotta get to this place, its off the charts!!!",1
xm1SHIAGpWuLh-8F89jBgg,"How did I forget to review this place?

Some of the best pierogi and potato pancakes you will find in the area. This is authentic polish food and you can tell by the flavor. The meat pierogi are my favorite! You can't go wrong with whatever flavor you get.

They have food available in stores as well a take out option. Wonderful place to get good home cooked polish food.",1
XM2qN3PiQbfSYo6zmHgSlQ,"I've been a part of the Warehouse District scene for years and years now if there's one thing I've learned, it's that I'm sick of the clubs. 

Yes, I've said it. I'm THOROUGHLY sick of the same crowd, packed into a dark bar, listening to the same loud (and obnoxious) music, wearing the same trashy outfits. I'm learning more and more how much more low-key I am, especially in my bar choices. 

That's why I absolutely LOVE Gillespie's Map Room! It's hidden away from the hustle and bustle of W6th, which I just think is fantastic. It's a true ""pub"" in every sense of the term. Open 365 days a year, Map never fails to satisfy that ""neighborhood bar"" craving, and also never surprises you.  It's always the same, chill, young-professional crowd just hanging out on a weekend night or grabbing a happy hour cocktail with some buddies.  The atmosphere is what you're craving, but unlike any other place in the Warehouse District. Basically what I'm telling you is that if you're looking for 21 year olds just learning how to drink in public, massive amounts of naked skin, loud music and dudes trying to take you home...please don't look for it here.  Map Room is where everyone else runs to hide from that ""club"" scene. 

Looking past all that good stuff, Map Room also has some of the cheapest drinks in town! Their happy hour is everyday from 3-7pm and features selections like $2 domestic drafts and $3 well drinks.  Other bottled beers and liquors are 25-50b off.  Keep in mind that their drink prices are pretty darn low BEFORE the discounts. Domestic drafts are always $2.25 and well drinks are like $3.50, tops. They also have a killer beer selection, including many micro-brews. Map also boasts a pretty extensive collection of vodkas and bourbons. I'm just saying...it's worth a visit just for the drink prices alone. 

Now, my favorite part of Gillespie's Map Room beyond the vibe and even the drink selection is the pizza. I've intentionally saved the best part for last because this is coming from a gal who is extremely picky about her 'zza. I'm not kidding. This pie is so good, I would give it the 'Best in Cleveland' award if it weren't for Little Italy.  Then again, if those authentic Italian restaurants couldn't do it better, that would be a problem. 

Anyways, back to the matter at hand, PIZZA! It's a New York style pie if you ask me. I'm not big on the whole 'thick crust' thing. It's a chewy dough with a homemade sauce that isn't too sweet. It's just right. I like it best when I enjoy it hot, right at the bar with p""pperoni and mushrooms on top, then hit it with some crushed red pepper and grated cheese.  Usually Jason (my boyfriend, who you'll hear about a lot in the future. Remember him) and I will grab a small pizza and share a Greek Salad.  The salads are nothing special, just head lettuce and the usual toppings. But I'm a sucker for pizza and ",1

If you would like a generous polish feast with a side of Cleveland delight visit this place. Must get here early but truly worth a wait for a wonderful time and polish feast,1
Xny0n0s98TpP82sQxfgIMQ,"Well what can you really say.  I'm sitting here, listening to beautiful piano being played 15 feet from me.  As I round 3rd base and lop up the rest of this very large meal, I can only assume I will be sitting here for a while to digest both my food and the wonderful ambience.

The meal; Weiner Schnitzel (veal), mashed potatoes (red), perogis, and stuffed cabbage w red sauce.

I got the veal and potatoes covered in a Salisbury gravy, each complimented each other: savory, hearty, and cooked to perfection. The perogis were perogis done right, with the perfect filling to noodle ratio, and that butter glaze that's missing when you try to make them yourself.  The stuffed cabbage was just  too much food, but what a mistake if I would have passed it up.  The red sauce was marvelous and authentic as you can get.

I'll leave this perfectly tuned opus of food, amosphere, and authenticity in a moment...full and happy.  But just one more song from that piano before I go..",1

Get the kielbasa dinner with an old fashioned black cherry cola. Buy yourself a shirt. Bring your family, girlfriends, and boyfriends. Tip the employees well, because they work hard just to serve you authentic Polish-American meals. 

I highly suggest buying some pepcid for the aftermath. Just sayin'.",1

Xny0n0s98TpP82sQxfgIMQ,"When I think about this establishment, ""Cleveland Rocks!"" is playing in my head. I guess this place makes me think of somewhere Drew Carey would have gone in the Drew Carey show. Or maybe he has been to Sokolowski. Pretty sure he has. I hope he has.

So this place just feels like home-like Cleveland. The Cleveland I think of when I think of my hometown. Nothing fancy. Comfort food and nice friendly people. 

My boyfriend and I were visiting the area and I wanted to take him somewhere that had food of the area. To me, polish food and perogies makes me think of the area. Too bad Parma perogies doesn't exist anymore. When I yelped Polish food, this is one of the recommendations that came up. 

We came mid day and there were a lot of older people eating. Cleveland sports paraphernalia was everywhere. Go tribe and dawg pound. Yep, that's Cleveland. The loyal sports fans.

It was very chilly that day so the warm inside of that restaurant combined with the comfort food was perfect. While waiting in line, there was a couple behind us- Cleveland locals who were giving us recommendations of what to order. They also pointed out buildings as we looked out the window. Their friendliest just added to the great experience.

The paper menu didn't list everything that was actually in the cafeteria style line, so it was alittle confusing going up to order but the lady serving us was nice.  We ordered chicken Paprikash and Stuffed Cabbage.  For sides we got macaroni and cheese, green beans, perogies and mashed potatoes. The food was really good. Not overly salty or overcooked. Sitting in hotel pans, I thought it could get overcooked, but it seems like the food goes fast.

One of the employees saw us taking pictures of the food. Think we stood out as yelpers? He was very sweet and took our picture. We were so stuffed at the end of the meal. So don't expect this to be a light fare.

A great meal. If you are looking for Polish food and an authentic Cleveland experience, come here!",1
Xny0n0s98TpP82sQxfgIMQ,"I've been travelling near Cleveland to see family for almost 25 years now.  I'm so sad it took me this long to learn about Sokolowski's.   I love restaurants that offer their own culture.  Sokolowski's has history, culture, nostalgia and walls filled with signed pics of many famous people that have travelled there just to experience it all.  And then, there's also the most amazing food.  You will not leave hungry.  Comfort food.  This time, they didn't have the Chicken Paprikash (which I absolutely LOVED last time!) so went for schnitzel. It was very good, but  I wish I'd asked for gravy.  Didn't want to fight the huge line to go back and get it.   I don't even like perogies elsewhere, but can't get enough of theirs, which are  bathed in onion/butter sauce.   Don't come here to cut calories!  Hubby had a huge cabbage roll.  They also have bit sandwich selection that look popular amongst other diners, but I can't get away from ordering the home-cooked entrees!     Will recommend it to all my friends too.  For St. Louis fans, I think this is the Ted Drewe's of Cleveland.   Once you've had it, you gotta go back anytime you're back in town.   It's an experience in itself that you can only get there!",1
Xny0n0s98TpP82sQxfgIMQ,"Cafeteria style ethnic food.  A great place to get some authentic eastern European ""stick-to-your-ribs"" meals.

I also highly recommend finishing off the ""waist line? why bother"" experience with desserts.Trust me, you want the desserts.

Xny0n0s98TpP82sQxfgIMQ,"3 generations of Polaks came into this place and left full and quite satisfied. 

As other reviewers have mentioned, it's cafeteria-styled with polish homemade food. 

I throughly enjoyed the stuffed cabbage: one large roll, the sauce, thin in consistency, is much more oily than others that I have had [red chimney, and any of them made by someone in the family ]. However, it was a large portion and still tasty. It also came with 2 sides, I chose the mashed potatoes, tasted exactly like my dad's [neither a compliment nor an insult to them]. They're not very creamy or have any specific flavor, but they're homemade and authentic; I would order them again next time. 

The dinners come with 2 side dishes [which included during my visit, mixed beans, mashed sweet potatoes with a marshmallow topping, mashed white Idaho Potatoes, diced red potatoes, and a couple others], a roll, and the salad bar. The salad bar was self-service and 3-4 salads including cold beet salad ['just like Babka's !', my dad said], potato salad, and a green salad with iceberg, mixed greens, and romaine, and cole slaw. In addition to the traditional polish entrees featured in the Dinners, Grandpa enjoyed his Lake Erie Perch. 

I also ordered a side of 2 pirogies for $2. They were excellent [and the recipe is on their website: cool!] They weren't doughy, and were cooked perfectly with slight grill marks. They were filled with American Cheese and the amount of cheese was perfect for me, neither overwhelming nor gooey.

In addition to the restaurant, there's also a small rectangular bar with a few domestic drafts [LaBatt and the High Life] and bottled craft beers [a couple German and Polish Beers, Indigo Imp and Sierra Nevada; they are also available in the cafeteria line in an iced bucket] [I daydreamed that there would be a POC, Pride of Cleveland, in that beer bucket] . 

For dessert, we split a slice of carrot cake. It's $5, but it's very large, rich, buttery frosting with the crushed nuts on top, I found it delicious. 

Yeah, their hours aren't the most convenient [it doesn't really bother me], but I came before 6 PM for dinner and waited no more than 10 minutes. 

A group of 4 dinners and non-alcoholic drinks, along with the dessert came out to ~$60. 

What pushed it to a 5: the service. Although the place was slightly hectic, the busboys were helping those unable to carry their trays and all of the staff was quiet friendly.",1
Xny0n0s98TpP82sQxfgIMQ,"Sokolowski's never disappoints! What a gem! Go for the phenomenal food; leave with memories of a great, traditional Cleveland landmark! Don't let the ""cafeteria"" style serving dissuade you from going! Super easy! (Just try to have your selections in mind BEFORE you get in line because it moves super fast!) As you're paying for your very reasonably priced dinner, a polite employee approaches, carries your tray to a table and seats you. No wandering around aimlessly looking for a spot to sit. The three of us had meatloaf (2) and pork chops (1). The two guys FLEW through their meatloaf! Tasty and done perfectly! The pork chops had just the right amount of fat to be like the chops you remember from when you were a kid! Yum! Yum! Yum! (OK, so it WAS me you saw picking up each chop and chewing off the final delicious bites! Sorry!) Great for families! A lot of groups! One sang a birthday song in Polish. (I think!) What an authentic touch!",1

You'll have to stand in line for at least 40 minutes on a weekend in this large buffet line that snakes around the restaurant, but it's worth it, and you'll be able to partially pass the time looking out their huge panoramic window sporting views of the city.

Xny0n0s98TpP82sQxfgIMQ,"I'm a Phoenix local and when in Cleveland.... you have to stop in this authentic Polish restaurant!!! The pierogis are like nothing you've ever had.

Not to mention the staff was incredibly polite, patient, and friendly!! ""Midwest nice"" is real! Don't miss out on Sokolowski's!!!",1
Xny0n0s98TpP82sQxfgIMQ,"This was my first time at this restaurant. It is one of my grandmas favorites so my family took her and my grandpa here for her birthday. I called a few weeks ahead to get a reservation and asked for a table in the ""piano room"" per my grandmas request. 

It is cafeteria style when you first arrive, as you go through a line and choose your entree and sides as well as dessert, then you head with your tray to your table. We were seated against the back wall at a nice long bench-style table to accommodate our larger group. There was a gentleman playing the piano and he seemed to remember my grandparents, as he started playing my grandmas favorite song, ""New York, New York,"" which she requests every time they're there. I know she enjoyed that. 

As for the food, the servings are huge and the food is very authentic and delicious. Make sure to get dessert as it was amazing as well!

Definitely a different dining experience than what I'm used to but would return.",1
Xny0n0s98TpP82sQxfgIMQ,"Sokolowski's offers some of the best food you'll ever eat in Cleveland or anywhere else for that matter. In an age where many chefs are attempting to push the gustatory envelope with all manner of hideous delights (bone marrow pudding, anyone?), the fine folks at this old school Tremont haunt are just fine with the traditional Polish fare they've spent the last ninety years perfecting. Anyone visiting the Cleveland area would do well to stop in to sample the nostalgia but get there early as there is often a lengthy line. 

Food:

A grand and mouth-watering offering of virtually every comfort food under the sun. The pierogies are a must: served piping hot and perfectly cooked in a rich and heavy butter sauce. They are soft pillows of love, heavy enough to sate even the most peckish palate, but constructed of the finest ingredients so they don't give you that wretched 'food baby' feeling afterwards, no matter how heartily you indulge. The Chicken Paprikash is also exquisite and overflowing with flavor. You can't go wrong with any of the sides. The first bite of sweet potatoes reduced one diner to tears as he remarked, ""This is like munching down on Grandma's Soul, in the best possible way of course!"" All the dishes are perfectly seasoned and the portions are mighty, particularly with only a $10 price tag on average. It's all served Cafeteria style, as other reviewers have dutifully noted, so expect to wait in line. 

Decor:

An Old World Polish wonderland. You step in through the back door and are immediately introduced to the microcosm by way of the Polka music streaming down over the food line. It's rampant, upbeat stuff that will make your time in line feel like a fever dream wedding from 1925. Take a moment to put away your concerns of modern civilization (Honestly, I felt very strange even taking my phone from my pocket inside) and scope out each and every bit of magic this place has to offer by way of transportive, intricate decor. There are the requisite celeb portraits (and at least one oil painting of the owner with bees skirting mindlessly through his ears), as well as many adorable accent pieces, and more wood paneled walls than you could count if you had all day to devote to it. This place screams authenticity in its very bones. Slaves to modernity will surely be disappointed.

Service:

Excellent. You can tell these folks have to deal with more than a few geriatrics (soft food calls them like moths to a flame) so they are pretty okay with repeating the list of daily offerings, though there are ample menus scattered around as you walk in. They load your plate efficiently and even if you drop a roll into the gravy (as happened to one unlucky diner), they're apt to laugh it off as a beginner's mistake, and even hand over said roll with a special set of tongs seemingly allocated for the purpose. Elsewhere, a waiter with a fifty six tooth grin grabbed my lover's plate as he whisked us across the dim but not quite gloomy dining room (windows do not abound in the Polish Wonderland, though one is not in want of them) to a 'reserved' table right by the piano player. ""This is Tom,"" the waiter remarked, ""He's been here forever and he'll play whatever you want."" Service indeed! Tom was an imposing, grinning, soft-eyed muse whose renditions of classics such as ""New York, New York"" left many diners clapping frantically. Tom's a lost vestige from another world content to finger the keys in the corner as he works his way through his nightly beer with mannered and leisurely aplomb. What a life, we kept thinking, what a world and what a life.

Closing: 

Here is a remnant kept lovingly alive from another world, a world few will ever see. Take a few hours to transport your mind and your belly. This place is vital. It pulses with history, life, and love.",1
Xny0n0s98TpP82sQxfgIMQ,"Oh. My. God. Don't think about it, just come here. When visiting Cleveland, I definitely wanted to get some authentic eastern European food and I don't think I could have made a better choice. Be careful of the hours because it's a lunch spot on the weekdays and a dinner spot on the weekends. We came for lunch, and it was a fun cafeteria style set-up. We definitely over-indulged by splitting chicken paprikash and stuffed cabbage, both of which come with sides. But then we added 12 pierogis. It was excess, but #NoRegrets. I can't even begin to tell you how amazing it all was. Just go and see for yourself.",1

Xny0n0s98TpP82sQxfgIMQ,"I find myself unusually nervous about reviewing Sokolowski's University Inn.  It just seems to be so venerated and beloved by so many.  But I'll be honest as my experience wasn't the best.  My husband and I visited recently on a cross country trip and we were excited to try a Polish restaurant while in Cleveland.  We did read some reviews beforehand, so we understood it was cafeteria style and there might be a long line and other minor eccentricities.  No problem, we thought.  When we arrived, there was no line at all, but we were confused by the dessert section coming first, so we attempted to enter from the other direction and were met by a confused and somewhat angry dishwasher who had difficulty communicating to us that we were heading in the wrong direction.  While that was certainly not his fault, it was disconcerting as a first impression.  We went back the original way and fell into line with our trays.  

The food items were not marked and there was no posted menu.  There were a few sheets of copy paper taped in various sections, either printed out from a Word program or written on with pen, to indicate pricing and menu items available.  My husband was most excited to try the scrod and they told us they hadn't had it in months.  By that time, there was a line forming and we made some quick picks and had to ask what everything was, so we tried to just go with whatever looked good.  We got kielbasa, chicken paprikash, pierogies, and green beans.  Overall, the taste was okay but not mind blowing.  My chicken seemed undercooked (pink center I could not eat), which was the worst offense here, but it was too busy by then to make any changes and to be honest I felt a little intimidated.  The sauce was good, at least.  

When I used the ladies restroom, an employee of Sokolowski's was on her way out and she screamed that I'd scared her.  I apologized twice and she kept repeating ""you scared me"" very angrily.  It was crazy, especially from an employee who was coming out as I was about to enter? I felt so uncomfortable and unwelcome here. 

We were shocked to find that these authentic pierogies tasted, to both of us anyway, exactly like Mrs. T's from the supermarket freezer.  I'm sure they are far better quality but I expected to taste a marked difference.  Also, the green beans were 2/3 bright green and 1/3 brown. I don't even know what else to say.  Two stars for my experience here, and hoping it was just an off day all around for this restaurant.",0
Xny0n0s98TpP82sQxfgIMQ,"This was my first time ever having authentic Polish food, and I have fallen in love. The stuffed cabbage is a MUST HAVE. The pierogis are AMAZING. The wait is long, but it is so worth it. Cafeteria-style eatery. This place is great! If you're ever in the Cleveland area, you have to stop in and try it out!!",1
Xny0n0s98TpP82sQxfgIMQ,"I went to Sokolowski's because I knew I had to have bratwurst and pierogies before leaving Cleveland.  I had a mission.

One of the first things I noticed about Sokolowski's, while standing in the slow-moving line (don't come here absolutely starving, you'll be in pain by the time you get your food) was that it's a sausage-fest both literally and figuratively.  The line was about 85% male, 100% of them middle-aged.  I can't explain this.

I got to the front of the line and the first thing you get to is dessert.  You pick your dessert first.  Seriously.  But I was on a mission, so I restrained myself from picking up one of the many delicious-looking varieties of cake and proceeded to the real food.

Service, once you get to the point where you're interacting with people, was actually pretty friendly.  I expected it to be rushed and gruff, but the guy at the counter took the time to explain what everything was to the guy behind me in line, and the cashier lady offered me water when she saw I wasn't getting a drink.  I got a bratwurst, which comes with two sides.  For me, 2 pierogies and green beans.  Plus a roll.  Total: a little over $8.  Awesome.

The food was great.  It was one of those meals that just made me really, really happy.  I can't say I know what an authentic Polish pierogi is supposed to taste like, but these were delicious.  I kind of wished I'd just gotten pierogies.  Not that the bratwurst wasn't good--I mean it was pretty tasty, but a tiny bit too gristly and didn't come close to the pierogies.  The roll was very good.  The green beans tasted like green beans.  They were really only there to counterbalance the heaviness of the brat and pierogies.  My biggest complaint is that nothing was really hot enough.  I know it's served cafeteria-style, so keeping things hot is tricky, but I don't like my food lukewarm.

Sokolowski's was my final real meal in Cleveland, and it was definitely a good way to round off my trip.  If I ever find myself back in northeast Ohio, there's no doubt that I'll be making another stop.",1
Xny0n0s98TpP82sQxfgIMQ,"Well worth the wait for this  classic cleveland eatery. Cafeteria style authentic polish delights. Super friendly wait staff, hot delish food, live piano player, fully stocked bar, best carrot cake ever...just like the sign says...come in as strangers, leave as friends.",1
Xny0n0s98TpP82sQxfgIMQ,"My only complaints about Sokolowski's are that the line was absurdly long which, I suppose, is a testament to how good this place is, and that the food was a mite greasy, the pierogies especially.

Other than that, though, this place serves up some mighty delicious Polish comfort food. I was able to try the kielbasa, beef stroganoff, and some sort of baked fish, all of which were top notch. The pierogies were also tasty, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I was essentially inhaling grease while eating them. We capped off our meal with blueberry pie and red velvet cake, both of which were very good.

Sokolowski's is an enjoyable dining experience if you have the time to wait in line. The decor and atmosphere are very, shall we say, authentic in their kitschiness and overall Polishness. A great choice for natives and visitors alike.",1
Xny0n0s98TpP82sQxfgIMQ,"So before I start writing this, I would like the reader know my background. I am from Chicago and my parents are from Poland. The Chicago Metropolitan area, which has 9 million people living there, has over 1 million Polish Speaking people. On every block you will see a Polish Deli and many Polish restaurants in the city and the area. Meanwhile, Cleveland has over 3,000 Polish speaking people. This is important for tourists for which I will explain later. Sokolowski is not really an authentic Polish restaurant, but they try and I will give them so much respect for that.

When I first moved here from Chicago, I wanted that good Polish food with Polish people and Polish language. I went onto this beautiful website called yelp and I found out about this place. Just like me giving this place 5 starts, everyone else has as well. I really wanted to come here and I am so glad I did. The food was very good. The peirogies (take note...they do not roll their r like Polish Speaking people do. I have a little Polish accent still and they didn't understand peirogies when you roll the r...the American lady didn't know what I was asking) were very good. They had a great selection of food there as well. I had the pierogies, mash potatoes, green beans, and salad. All for 11 something dollars. Not a bad deal at all. It was very filling and again, the pierogies are awesome. There are many cool pics of Cleveland especially baseaball and football stuff (this is an americanized joint...so don't expect Poland's number one sport...soccer...to be on the walls).

Now with all that said, I would like to talk about my first paragraph. For ethnic Poles coming in from places from Chicago, New York, or even Poland itself. This is NOT a Polish ethnic restaurant. This is not Krystinas, U Gazdy, or EJ's Pierogies in the Chicago area. This is an Americanized joint serving some really good Polish food. The bartender and people behind the counter are not Polish. Cleveland is not like Chicago and they don't have a high Polish population and many have assimilated. HOWEVER....you need to check this place out. The sautÁE©ed Pierogies are amazing and and the food was awesome. They do serve kielbasa and guompki (they don't know that that is so just call it stuffed cabbage). And it's good. Sorry....no Zywiec here, but they do serve Okocim and one other Polish beer. I believe Stawski (?).  

If u want to go watch Poland during the Euro Championships and hang with Polish fans then don't come here. It's Americanized so baseball and football is huge here. 

One thing I was suprised about the Pierogies. They only had one flavor. So no meat Pierogies, farm cheese Pierogies, and stuff like that.

The history of the place is very cool though with the place growing when the bridge was being built and the workers wanted a place to eat. 

Great view of the bridge and city!",1
Xny0n0s98TpP82sQxfgIMQ,"I like it automatically because of my Polish heritage. My Grandma is a pretty bad cook. She would have dirty, weathered hands, sometimes with dirt under her nails from working out in her garden. She would always grab food with those hands and slop some food on your plate and make you eat it. If not, you would be ridiculed, called fussy, and be compared to your good cousins who would eat anything thrown in front of them. Her golumpki (stuffed cabbage) was way better than Sokolowski's. I would eat that golumpki from her gnarled hands any day of the week over here. Also, you can't go here any day of the week because the hours are so limited. The pierogies are also just decent. If you are not from a Polish family, go to Sokolowski's, it will be the closest thing to having an authentic meal. I like the picture of Pope John Paul because there are tons of pictures of him all over my Grandma's place. She has a bunch of little statuettes of him and other saints strategically placed throughout the house. I should Yelp on her house because that is what this review turned into. I love you Grandma. Rest in peace.",1
Xny0n0s98TpP82sQxfgIMQ,"The place is an absolute joke, the pierogi are really thick like out of a frozen pierogi box they are drenched in grease and definitely nothing special. The owner is a clown and overall this just isn't a good Polish food place if you want authentic Polish food. Unfortunately there really are no authentic Polish food places in Cleveland Ohio if you want some authentic Polish food you have to get to know a hard working Polish person who really knows how to cook it which is definitely not the owner or Sokolowski's. Trust me I know what I am talking about and the best Polish food that I ever ate came from my mothers and grandmothers cooking. Ps. Even Seven Roses has better food than this pile of mess.

Xny0n0s98TpP82sQxfgIMQ,"If you're looking for a break from chain restaurants and all their plastic cheerfulness, try Sokolowski's - which is authentic as it gets.  

It serves cafeteria food - but don't let that dissuade you, because if your middle school served what Sokolowski's did, you'd put on a hoodie and try to sneak back even now.  Every item of food on the line is handmade (right down to the root beer and the cream pies), served in a place that's comfortingly dark without being dank.  

This is THE place for comfort food.  Get your tray and wander down the line, folks.  

It looks, as others have noted, like your grandparents' basement, complete with an abundance of sports memorabilia on the walls, hand-drawn pictures from relatives, and portraits of the owners.  The heavy wooden tables are scarred but infinitely comfortable.  

The folks there are unfailingly friendly - I've been twice but they greeted me with a please hello every time, giving me suggestions and handing me free pierogies when they discovered it was my first time.   

The food?  Well, it's pure starch and meat.  The potatoes are hand-made, the corn is great, and every day they have honkin' meaty specials from salisbury steak to a rich, moist Yankee pot roast.  They have sausages of all sorts, and damn good sauerkraut.  I wouldn't trust the green beans, which looked overcooked to the point of being soggy.... But you're not here to eat healthy, goddammit.  

The food is what they call stick-to-your-ribs meals, and you'll like it if you're in the mood.   For that, it's five stars.  If you're in the mood for lighter fare, or you have a vegetarian in your party, you're out of luck.  

But you know, then you shouldn't be eating there.",1
Xny0n0s98TpP82sQxfgIMQ,"So before I start writing this, I would like the reader know my background. I am from Chicago and my parents are from Poland. The Chicago Metropolitan area, which has 9 million people living there, has over 1 million Polish Speaking people. On every block you will see a Polish Deli and many Polish restaurants in the city and the area. Meanwhile, Cleveland has over 3,000 Polish speaking people. This is important for tourists for which I will explain later. Sokolowski is not really an authentic Polish restaurant, but they try and I will give them so much respect for that.

When I first moved here from Chicago, I wanted that good Polish food with Polish people and Polish language. I went onto this beautiful website called yelp and I found out about this place. Just like me giving this place 5 starts, everyone else has as well. I really wanted to come here and I am so glad I did. The food was very good. The peirogies (take note...they do not roll their r like Polish Speaking people do. I have a little Polish accent still and they didn't understand peirogies when you roll the r...the American lady didn't know what I was asking) were very good. They had a great selection of food there as well. I had the pierogies, mash potatoes, green beans, and salad. All for 11 something dollars. Not a bad deal at all. It was very filling and again, the pierogies are awesome. There are many cool pics of Cleveland especially baseaball and football stuff (this is an americanized joint...so don't expect Poland's number one sport...soccer...to be on the walls).

Now with all that said, I would like to talk about my first paragraph. For ethnic Poles coming in from places from Chicago, New York, or even Poland itself. This is NOT a Polish ethnic restaurant. This is not Krystinas, U Gazdy, or EJ's Pierogies in the Chicago area. This is an Americanized joint serving some really good Polish food. The bartender and people behind the counter are not Polish. Cleveland is not like Chicago and they don't have a high Polish population and many have assimilated. HOWEVER....you need to check this place out. The sautÁE©ed Pierogies are amazing and and the food was awesome. They do serve kielbasa and guompki (they don't know what that is so just call it stuffed cabbage). And it's good. Sorry....no Zywiec here, but they do serve Okocim and one other Polish beer. I believe Stawski (?).  

If u want to go watch Poland during the Euro Championships and hang with Polish fans then don't come here. It's Americanized so baseball and football is huge here. 

One thing I was suprised about the Pierogies. They only had one flavor. So no meat Pierogies, farm cheese Pierogies, and stuff like that.

The history of the place is very cool though with the place growing when the bridge was being built and the workers wanted a place to eat. 

Great view of the bridge and city!",1
Xny0n0s98TpP82sQxfgIMQ,"This is the best home-cooked comfort in Cleveland! Family-owned restaurant with old-world Polish courses that taste better than mom ever made them (but don't tell her that!). 

Sokolowski's University Inn is an old gem at the north end of Cleveland's Tremont district that serves food in a cafeteria style restaurant. The whole place is a bit eccentric. Decor is certainly dated, but I wouldn't change a thing. I've often found my lunch party being treated to beautiful music from a pianist, but the atmosphere isn't formal at all. Once you walk in, go straight forward and pick up a tray. To your left, you'll see the specials on a chalk board. You'll have a chance to get drinks, desserts and salads ala carte before heading down to the serving area. 

Regular entrees are the salisbury steak, which is a softball-sized piece of seasoned hamburger with gravy and onions; the stuffed cabbage; pierogies; fish; and chicken paprikash. Everything I've ever tried here is delicious. I wish I could find some criticism, but I'm drawing a blank. Maybe less glutinous? If you're here on a diet eating one of the salads, I give you my deepest sympathies. 

Enjoy this restaurant, as these types of family restaurants become less and less common!",1
Xny0n0s98TpP82sQxfgIMQ,"BEST local authentic Polish find!

If you love a great restaurant full of authentic culture and cuisine then this is the spot for you!! Sokolowskis is a one-of-a-kind find with a long standing history in Tremont and amazing Polish food to try. 

The line is always super long, but dont let that stop you, it moves very quickly and is well WORTH THE WAIT. Make sure to check the hours as it is only open for a few hours for lunch and dinner.

Entrees are HUGE and come with a salad and bread so I recommend splitting. AND that is the best way to sample multiple dishes. You have to get the pierogi appetizer to share with your group, they are delicious. Pair it with a Polish draft beer from the bar to top off your meal.",1
Xny0n0s98TpP82sQxfgIMQ,"I love places like this. Once you step in, you really get a sense of an older time of Cleveland, where polish men would be arguing over their drinks at the bar, surrounded by sports memorabilia and other polish trinkets.

I came here around 8PM and there wasn't much of a line. The food section is cafeteria style. I, of course, got the pierogis because it's my favorite food ever. I also got baby back ribs. Other people at my table got cabbage rolls, salisbury streak and kielbasa. 

The food was so good- super authentic Eastern European cuisine. The pierogies were very similar to how my grandmother and mother make them, which i really appreciated. Super thin dough, lightly sautÁE©ed with fried onions and a potato filling. The ribs were super flavorful and cooked really well. All meals also come with access to the salad bar!

The location of this place is also super nice. Tremont has a nice look out to see the rest of the city. Def a good opportunity for pictures!",1
Xny0n0s98TpP82sQxfgIMQ,"Can you say, ""Tastes like Cleveland""?  

After this wonderfully authentic experience of the eyes, ears and stomach, you will get a taste of Cleveland in all it's starchy - but yummy - glory!

Do not be intimidated by the very nice lady saying stuff to you as you approach your hot meal section of the cafeteria styled restaruant.  Grab your dessert, salad and drink and just smile, point and nod. 

Smile, point and nod.  That's all you need to know.

You will not go wrong with the Pirogies.  Yes, it is a fried starch pocket filled with more starch - potato in this case - but combine that with the mashed potatoes, gravy and sour cream and you pretty much have an Atkins dieter nightmare.  But oh so good.  Oh so good.

Go now.",1
Xny0n0s98TpP82sQxfgIMQ,"Oh boy...it was worth moving from CA. just to experience this place. I grew up enjoying authentic Polish food. I sure have missed it since moving to the west coast.  Since moving to Cleveland recently, I've been meaning to try Sokolowski's. So glad I did. 
It was hard to decide what to get. Got the stuffed cabbage, with sides of pierogies and sauerkraut. And it came with a great salad bar...with marinated cucumbers in sauce that I remember from childhood.
Everything was fantastic, and the staff here are super friendly.
I'll be back!",1
Xny0n0s98TpP82sQxfgIMQ,"Came to this establishment on a Tuesday; early afternoon. The parking is tight if you have an F-150, but we found a spot on side of restaurant that was easy to maneuver into. The inside of restaurant has a warm rustic ambiance. The restaurant was busy, but the cafeteria style line moved very quickly. There was a selection of salads - tossed salad that looked very fresh, tempting fruit salad and pickled beets. I chose the beets that were mildly pickled and tasted great with the pickled grated horshradish. Loved the mild sweetness to the horshradish. The line had an array of selections - chicken, sausages, salsbury steak, meatloaf, fried fish. The sides were - saurkraut, corn, green beans, mac&cheese, cheesy potatoes, cabbage& noodles, mashed potatoes. Since this was my first time coming here, it was so hard to choose. I settled for the meatloaf, mashed potatoes and gravy, corn and roll. I also got a side of pierogies. Everything was hot, flavorful and tasted authentic. The meatloaf was a nice size portion and was topped with sweet tomato sauce. It was moist and just like my mother used to make. The mashed potatoes were fluffy and topped with a flavorful gravy from the salsbury steak which had onions and carrots in it for max flavor. The corn was crisp and sweet. The pierogis were best I've had and were topped with minced carmalized onions. Best meal I've had out in a long time. I could have taken a nap afterwards. Plan to return with my husband. I know he'd love it.",1
Xny0n0s98TpP82sQxfgIMQ,"Sokolowski's is a Cleveland institution and a must visit for any out of towner wanting to get a feel for the kind of food and people Cleveland was built on. I love bringing visiting friends and family here, and they in turn love me for brining to enjoy all this awesome home-style food! 

The restaurant is cafeteria-style and newcomers might be a little overwhelmed by all the delicious sights and smells. Pierogi are a must-have, but otherwise my favorites are the paprikash and schnitzel. That being said, you can't go wrong with whatever you choose! A friend recently ordered the perch dinner and said it was some of the best she's ever had. All meals also come with roll and salad bar, and beer is available for those who want it. 

If you're looking for good, authentic Polish food and are in the area, Sokolowski's should be your first stop!",1
Xny0n0s98TpP82sQxfgIMQ,"Came here on the tourist tour of Cleveland! This is a cafeteria-style Polish restaurant where you can order entrees (which comes with two sides) or individual orders of sides. We got the chicken paprikash and stuffed cabbage entrees with sides of mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, sauerkraut, pierogis, as well as a side of 6 pierogis. The chicken paprikash and the mashed potatoes were a little bland, but was a big fan of the stuffed cabbage and pierogis with the sauerkraut and the free sour cream. The restaurant felt very authentic to Cleveland and Polish food. Definitely worth paying a visit to when you're here!",1
Xny0n0s98TpP82sQxfgIMQ,"Um, I cannot say enough good things about Sokolowski's. I went here with my mom (who is 50% Polish) yesterday for the first time. It has been on my Cleveland bucket list for food for a few years now, and boy, it did not disappoint. I was a little surprised by the ""cafeteria style"" ordering, but it was super easy to order food and the lunch line went very quickly. I got the periogi meal (6 of them plus 2 sides and a roll), and they were absolutely to die for! My mom got the steamed kielbasa sandwich, and she loved it. Thank you for creating such authentic Polish dishes - it takes me back to my grandma's cooking when I was growing up. I can't wait to take more of my family there to eat.",1
XS1Zx6GzjtKPKmhDuVw5Jg,"This is hands down my new favorite place in Cleveland. 

This place has it all. Aside from some initial confusion of which door to use to enter the restaurant, Collision Bend is flawless. First, the space itself is striking. The interior is beautiful and roomy. It is a fairly casual place, but can be intimate at the same time. The real gem is the patio. It sits right on the river, with breathtaking views. While not a huge space, it is comfortable even when it gets crowded. With a full service bar indoors and outdoors, you're never lacking for a drink. This is among the best patios in the Flats and in Cleveland, rivaling that of Coastal Taco. You can get the best of both worlds by sitting in just adjacent to the patio in the interior, with uninterrupted windows overlooking the patio and the river with full climate control.

Collision Bend's beers ought to be good as a brewery, and I've been happy with all the brewskis I've sampled. My go-to is the C-Town Pale Ale, but my friends' Iron Wind Pilsner and East Bank IPA were tasty and refreshing. The beers are slightly pricey for Cleveland at $6.50, but well worth a pour or two.

The food offerings are creative, well-executed, delicious, and very reasonable. We decided to get a taste of the small plates, electing to pass on the pizza. My friend and I shared the lamb gyro style taco, giant molten meatball, Collision Bend popcorn, lamb tamales (we were really craving lamb), and Asian-style arancini Siciliana. 

The popcorn came out first, and one of the servers announced, ""This is the best popcorn in all of Cleveland."" I love my popcorn and was cynical of his proclamation--he was probably overcompensating. But, WOW! This is the best popcorn in all of Cleveland. Seriously I was grabbing handfuls of this stuff with both fists, fighting off my friend. It's made with schmaltz, which reminds me of the Jewish food at home, but makes it delicious. It's not overly greasy at all, and the texture of the popcorn remained crunchy, not even the least bit soggy. Seriously, get the popcorn. It's only $4, and if you don't like it, give it to me.

The lamb taco was really good too--better than anything you'd get at Coastal Taco down the street. An order of ""tacos"" comes with only one taco, and it was $9. Don't think it's the best value at Collision Bend (did I mention the popcorn?), but worth a try. The giant molten meatball, filled with cheese, was done really well and their red sauce was surprisingly authentic. I had tried the meatballs at Saucy Brew Works just two days earlier, and Collision Bend's were way better. The lamb tamale was done well; the masa maybe just a tad too dense. I had been skeptical of the Asian-style arancini (those two things don't go together, it's WRONG), but my friend insisted we try them, and the combination actually worked. The filing was definitely ""Asian-style"" and the arancini were perfectly fried, not too greasy. The wasabi mayo was controversial at our table--I enjoyed it, while my friend did not. If you're intrigued, I'd say go for it. There were several other items on the menu that caught my eye and were quite innovative, so an updated review may be in store--stay tuned!

tl;dr: This place is the bee's knees. If I ever go missing and it's patio weather in Cleveland, you'll probably find me here.",1
xu3JbicQsPv1lay0cT6tRw,Cleveland Tiffin is definitely the go-to spot in Cleveland for authentic Indian food.  We called in our order and drove over to pick it up.  We were given piping hot samosas as we waited for our freshly cooked food.  We ordered the chicken tikka and it was wonderful.  Couldn't have more authentic food if it was made by our mothers!  Will definitely be going back.  An ideal spot for busy professionals/medical students/medical residents to pick up food for the week.  (This is not however a place for a sit-down meal...more-so a storefront for pick-up).,1
xu3JbicQsPv1lay0cT6tRw,"I am visiting this area for work. I yelped and found out about this gem. Food is absolutely amazing. It is real authentic Punjabi Indian food.

They were really accommodating and the food was delivered on time. I would definitely order from them again.",1

xu3JbicQsPv1lay0cT6tRw,"""Home Fresh Food Cooked to Order"" 

This a TRUE taste of India!  The food is as fresh as it gets SO you will have to wait a few minutes. (There is a wonderful Indian store a few doors down you can visit while you wait).  You can also call ahead.  Either way, it is absolutely worth the wait.  I ordered the Chicken Korma and it was DECADENT!  The spices and flavor were fresh, full and numerous. 

If you do decide to eat there, which you can, there are about 6-8 tables if you want a place to sit down and enjoy their flavorful, authentic food but most people take it home/work.  

The owner was an absolute gentleman.  When he told us we would have to wait a few minutes for our dishes he looked worried because I could tell he took pride in pleasing the customer, (Customers FIRST).  It was NOT an issue because with the Indian store a few doors down and we told him we would see him in a ""30 min"".  On our arrival back he was ready for us and said, ""We're bagging it right now but I have something for you."" He came up to us with a small tray of what he called ""Indian French Fries"" (not on the menu...YET) and let us try some of them and they were a tasty little treat.  He truly LOVES what he does and even told us, ""This isn't just a business but this is our passion."" AMAZING. 

We will DEFINITELY be back!  Looking forward to it!",1
xu3JbicQsPv1lay0cT6tRw,"Delicious and interesting freshly-made food with made-to-order spiciness.  It's not dirt-cheap, but prices are reasonable for the heap of food you get.  (To-go boxes are available.) Dishes are excellent for sharing.  In terms of ambiance, Tiffin is not a restaurant but a spartan storefront for pick-up and catering.  Nonetheless, there is some comfortable seating and available drinks.  If you enjoy an authentic hole-in-the wall with tasty cuisine and low overhead, then this is your spot for dinner or lunch.  Dropping by the Indo-Pak grocery next door makes for a worthwhile trip, too.",1
xu3JbicQsPv1lay0cT6tRw,Amazing food and extremely friendly service. Seems like take out only place but they were ok with me eating at the few tables they had. The food tasted very authentic and the way it does as home.,1
xu3JbicQsPv1lay0cT6tRw,"Cleveland Tiffin serves fresh, homemade indian food that is both tasty and healthy. Forget the cream laden curries filled with bad calories you get served at most indian restaurants and welcome to authentic food from the kitchen of an Indian mother. I love both styles of Indian food and each has its' time/place to be enjoyed. I got the bangain bartha (eggplant) and saag paneer (spinach cheese). Both were delicious and well spiced.

Cleveland Tiffin is truly a hole-in-the-wall. Located in a desolate, nondescript complex, the interior of the place is unfinished with cheesy art pieces on the wall. Old school bollywood music playing transported me to the '90s. There are a few tables, but takeout food is the entire business. You come here for the quality of food and nothing else.

I spoke briefly with the owner of Tiffin. He mentioned they are looking to launch a food truck in Cleveland next summer. Fingers crossed, would be a welcome addition to the scene!",1

The restaurant owner was very understanding when I used the yelp app to order delivery through Grubhub (first time) and it came up as a pick up order.  He delivered our order in person and even stayed to chat for a bit sharing the history of getting into the restaurant business.  Very personable and friendly.

xu3JbicQsPv1lay0cT6tRw,"I'm so glad we drove past Cleveland Tiffin on our way to oil change one day and we decided to give it a shot. Cleveland Tiffin is where we go for authentic home-cooked Indian meal - just like how mom cooks - not too much oil/grease/masalas, unlike restaurants. 
The food is truly yummilicious, unlike most Indian restaurants in the area. We order and call ahead (they also have a daily menu) and have enjoyed everything we have ordered here.
Our favorite 5 are: saag, chicken tikka masala, Punjabi pakora kadhi, mattar paneer, and rajma chawal. We also love the samosas and pakoras here. And the chilly chicken, goat curry, besan gatte ki sabji, aloo baingan and baingan bharta. LOL yes we love everything we have ever tried here!

xu3JbicQsPv1lay0cT6tRw,"My wife and I have been patrons for many years. We love the WEEKLY TIFFIN service delivery - it offers delicious vegetarian and non-vegetarian food with portions for a genuinely unbeatable price. 

For those unfamiliar with Weekly Tiffin, it's a delivery or pick-up service (only on Mon. and Wed., need to order 1 day before!) providing 5 different dishes with or without rotis (Indian ""tortillas""). The Weekly Tiffin is enough to feed my wife and me multiple meals throughout the week. We try to cook at home regularly, but when we are pressed for time, the Weekly Tiffin delivery is a fantastic option for quality, home-cooked food.

We really love everything on the Weekly Tiffin menu. The Fish Pakora (pairs awesomely with ice-cold beer!) and the Punjabi Kadhi Pakora are also very good and worth a try. These are uncommon finds at a typical Indian restaurant.

It's clear from the quality of the food and from interacting with the owners over the years that they are passionate about their food and committed to the quality. Go give it a try, or, if you don't want to/can't cook for a week, try out the WEEKLY TIFFIN service!",1

XUA7xA7myMaCuN6G3xYdIA,"Wandered into Number One Pho on a Monday afternoon after finding out that Superior Pho was closed on Mondays (bummer!) and decided to finally give it a shot. Let the battle of the pho restaurants begin!

Sure, the location and ambience of Number One Pho is better than my go-to pho restaurant, Superior Pho. But when it comes to casual ethnic restaurants, I'm all about the authenticity, quality, and taste of the food. We ordered the crispy spring rolls and phos. The crispy spring rolls were alright, but pricey (2 for $5). Nothing to rave about, but nothing to complain about either. Upon tasting the broth of my pho tai (with rare beef), I felt that something about the seasoning was off. The broth tasted bland and had a much sweeter taste than what I typically expect from pho. It also seemed like the broth was not filtered enough as there were tons of mini floating pieces of fat from the beef bones. I had no problems with the consistency of the noodles, but the rare beef was not thinly sliced and was very leathery and hard to chew. I could not take another bite of the beef afterwards. I usually take my leftover pho broth home to make noodle soup with later, but the taste of the broth was so off-putting that I didn't. 

I will definitely be sticking to Superior Pho for pho (and bahn mi, which Number One Pho didn't seem to have), as long as my memory can serve me correctly that they're not open on Mondays.",0
XUA7xA7myMaCuN6G3xYdIA,"Though I don't have many places which I liked during my stay in Cleveland but this was an exception. Visited this restaurant during extreme cold and to get better food as downtown does not have good options.

Located in an industrial area this is probably the only restaurant in the area. The place itself is very spacious and had ample seating available for patrons. After my initial visit I came here a couple of times. My favorites here are the Pho and chicken cabbage salad. The pho broth is so good I can eat it all day along, definitely a must visit place when craving some good authentic pho.",1
XUA7xA7myMaCuN6G3xYdIA,"Ordered: Pho dac biet, Pho tai, Vietnamese coffee x2
Price: $28 w/o tax (10.50 + 9.50 + 8 respectively)

Ambiance: A somewhat old feeling establishment with not a lot of Vietnamese character. They had a standing fan running instead of the AC which always makes places instantly feel more ghetto. Adding to this, the tap water tasted slightly weird and my fork had a thin slimy film that left me feeling dirtier having touched it. The worst part part was my server correcting my pronunciation of the dishes with his own butchered versions (grew up in a Vietnamese-speaking household).

Food: Pho perfectionists serve their meat rare so it finishes cooking in the broth at the table and stays tender but ours came out fully cooked. The noodles, which were on the skimpy side, came out under-cooked and needed to sit 3-4 minutes until they were al-dente. The one thing #1 Pho has going for it is that they actually have a decent broth, it is salty and savory without being adulterated with spices like black pepper, anise, etc. The broth could stand to be concentrated just a little bit more to intensify things but otherwise I wouldn't change a thing about it. The Vietnamese coffee was also served pre-made which robs you of the experience and aroma of having it drip-brew at the table and they also add creamer in addition to the condensed milk which is a non-traditional move.

Overall I wasn't a fan of #1 Pho's attention to detail or authenticity. They seem a little ghetto and skimpy but compared to Superior Pho across the street, they do admittedly have the better broth.",0
XUA7xA7myMaCuN6G3xYdIA,"Food: 5/5
Environment: 4.5/5
Mood: 4/5
Service: 4/5

Verdict: One of my favorite places to eat in Cleveland. People prefer other restaurants but I'll always stand by No. 1 Pho

Environment:
I absolutely love this place. Other people tell me they like Superior Pho or Wonton Gourmet more but nah, I'm always all about the #1 Pho. It's a spacious dining area and they try to seat you where you have space AKA not next to another table when the whole restaurant is open. The decor is pleasant and street parking is always available. The bathrooms are singles.

Mood: 
The decor really establishes the mood for the place. It feels authentic but not so much in your face about it. Comes across as classy-cultural even if i arrive in casual dress.

Food: 
Where do I even start....
I always get the salt and pepper seafood or calamari. The taste in it is so simple and yet savory. Most times i order two and then a soup. Besides their pho being freshly made, their bun bo hue and mi bo kho are my favorites. Sometimes it's a little salty but I like adding a lil jalapeno and it cancels out for the most part. 

Service:
So most times when I go, there's usually one server who takes care of the whole restaurant. They're pretty good at it too but sometimes it can take a lil bit for them to come around.

Also, last trip, there was a piece of plastic in my soup. One mistake out of the 10 times I've gone was forgivable to me though. I'll always come back.",1
XUA7xA7myMaCuN6G3xYdIA,"Number One Pho is our favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Cleveland, we have tried several different restaurants but continually come back to here. The Pho's (soups) are fantastic and very authentic, my wife and I however enjoy several appetizers they have on offer. The Salt Baked Squid is a must try, even if your just going in for Pho you won't be disappointed with the squid is is very awesome (but you must need to like garlic), the Crispy Shrimp is normally cooked to perfection but needs to be eaten on arrival which is very hot. The Shrimp and Pork Cabbage Salad is probably our overall favorite to the Squid, it is fresh and it seems you just can't get enough of it. Highly recommended!",1
XUA7xA7myMaCuN6G3xYdIA,"I've been here a few times and I have to say the food is really good and always consistent. Never very crowded and we always get fast service as soon as we sit down. I have to say the restaurant itself is a bit run down and not very fancy but we come here for the delicious food. I love their pork and shrimp spring rolls to start. They have a wonderful peanut sauce and chili sauce if you like it spicy.

I've had their soups and noodle bowls and they always hit the spot! Fresh ingredients make for a very satisfying meal. I highly recommend the vermicelli. The chicken, pork, beef, or shrimp vermicelli, they are all very good! The Vietnamese noodle bowls are very filling and delicious too. The large portion is only $1 more than the regular portion and it's worth it. You can definitely take home left overs.

On the bad side, They don't really serve any alcohol. We wanted to order beers but they only had bud light so we passed. They don't have any wine or liquor. However, If you're looking for some authentic Vietnamese this should be your first stop. It's #1! :)",1
XUA7xA7myMaCuN6G3xYdIA,"Number 1 Pho was plan B, because Superior Pho happened to be closed. 
California native, and former Bostonian resident, a bowl of sub-par pho is wayyyy over priced for Cleveland!  I wasn't the happiest camper after wasting calories on this joint!  The broth taste like water.  I wanted to add the fish sauce in myself. Instead, I numbed my taste buds with siracha.  You must be paying extra for the decor and illusion that you are in an authentic Vietmanese resturant.",0
XUA7xA7myMaCuN6G3xYdIA,"We came here to have authentic Pho which we used to get it at this restaurant. BUT, today is VERY DISAPPOINTING ....

There was no basil leaves served.  When we asked the waitress,  she said we are out, which she should have told us before we asked.
The soup was tasteless.  

VERY DISAPPOINTING.  WE WILL NEVER GO AGAIN.

XUA7xA7myMaCuN6G3xYdIA,"The pho was good, flavorful and was authentic enough. We asked for extra meat and they delivered a full serving which was nice. The spring roll sauce was just hoisin and peanuts which wasn't that tasteful. The place had a nice environment and was clean. The server was nice and attentive. Generally, it was a nice lunch.",1
XUA7xA7myMaCuN6G3xYdIA,"Number One Pho is number one in my heart! I love Asian food, and this place definitelyâE has a ton of tasty options to choose from!

To drink, I got the mango bubble tea. I'm obsessed with bubble tea, so my standards are pretty high when it comes to this tasty drink. Number One Pho surpassed my expectations, and the tea to tapioca bubbles ratio was perfect! It was perfectly sweetened.

I got the fried tofu for dinner, and it was cooked to perfection. It came with a soy sauce, which was a perfect complement to the tofu. 

Next time I'm looking for some authentic Asian food in Cleveland, this place will be my first choice!",1
XUA7xA7myMaCuN6G3xYdIA,Worse Vietnamese food in the area. Not authentic. Best thing on the menu is the sugar cane drink. Service is horrible.,0
XUA7xA7myMaCuN6G3xYdIA,"ENVIRONMENT: Nice, older building converted to restaurant bar. Pleasing and charming enough. Could be good hang out.

STAFF: Good staff, nice, attentive. Familial staff.

FOOD: Unfortunately this is where it is not No. 1. The food is not cooked badly per se, but the seasoning is all far too sweet... usually that's a sign of catering to American palette. 

a) Pho Dac Biet - Usually the top level pho (with all of the special meats) had poor cuts of beef. Half of which I didn't even recognize the cuts. One looked shredded? The couple good flank slices were too few. Meat balls were good, but not hard to do considering they're bought frozen. The rare slices were not good quality and chewy as heck... cut at different thicknesses, which don't help. Again... broth was really sweet and you couldn't discern the anise or Viet cinnamon, but that is typical of 90% of Pho restaurants around US. The sprouts and basil were fresh though. One of the worst things about American pho is the use of jalapeno peppers instead of Thai peppers, but that's minor compared to broth. Not the worst pho I've had, but barely average due to poor meat cuts.

b) Bun Bo Hue - The classic, spicey noodle soup used correct noodles, but broth was sweet again. Not sure if MSG or sugar, but it over took the spiciness, which was OK. Lacked all of the proper veggie sides. Poor meat cuts, but plenty of pig shank, feet if that is your thing. Mediocre.

c) Canh Chua - This is the typical sweet and sour soup of Nam and it was the worst example of the soup we've ever had. This broth is supposed to be sweet, but lordy... it could have killed a diabetic. There was hardly a sense of tamarind fruit that gives the broth the sour. It's obvious they're using soup bases and that isn't a bad thing per se... if you dope it with more authentic herbs, etc., because the dried soup seasonings you buy tend to be watered down compared to how mom makes it. The worst thing about the soup was the use of broccoli, bell pepper, and carrots (i.e. These are not used in this broth... ever.). The only thing they got right was tomatoes and sprouts. The authentic veggie (I don't know what it is called in English, but it has elephant ear like leaves and is like a sponge in the soup. Okra is some times used.) was not available, which is probably due to sourcing limitations of Cleveland. The fish was good. Fried garlic was good. Rice with dish was good, but that's hard to screw up.


I don't want to sound harsh, because I know how hard it is to operate a sustainable restaurant... in a place where the customer palette for said cuisine is limited, but it can be done without dumbing it down. The trick is limiting your selection and doing that authentic and well. This place has the other variables correct, but the main one needs fixing. Of course... if they are successful with what appears to be mainly western palette then don't fix what isn't broken. For Viet customers though... go elsewhere. 

Note: I'm Vietnamese.",0
XUA7xA7myMaCuN6G3xYdIA,"Disappointed in the quality of the food.  We ordered bun bo hue and grilled pork with rice.  The bun bo hue is off in flavor, not the correct meat, no herbs and ban mana flowers.  Overall, it was not bun bo hue.  The rice dish was not fresh.  Aside the rice, the food was prep made and just reheated. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant if you're looking for authentic and fresh Vietnamese food.",0

xXZw2v10FbaqRiibXhAhlg,We do carry out but I like going here during the Christmas holiday. Downtown Willoughby is gorgeously decorated and Fanucce's is warm and cozy inside. We've gone there on a Friday night and fortunate to have an accordionist entertain up with wonderful godfather type music. As mentioned in previous posts I'm not a fan of pizza but this stuff does get my salivary glands working overtime. Tastes better eating in then out - maybe the music & atmosphere. Good appetizers like smelt - different. Family owned authentic Italian.,1
xXZw2v10FbaqRiibXhAhlg,"I always like the food. Very large portions at a great price. Very good wedding soup, Veal Parmigiano, and Linguine with Clam Sauce.
This place is a great place for large portions of great tasting authentic Italian food at a fair price.
The location in Downtown Willoughby is great because the public lot at the old court house is a half block away. Much better location than many of the other restaurants in downtown section.",1
XYQx_ADdAYwfUEgN7eGmQA,"I loved coming to Asian Grille! I came by special invitation of my friend Kiwi, who owns this Thai restaurant right on the border of Cleveland/Lakewood. I've had a few of their regular items at the Night Market - their pad thai is excellent and they were a huge hit at NMC! 

This is mostly commenting on their special menu that they prepared for us (and you can have it too as long as you let them know ahead of time!) My friend's mom (known as Mom) cooked authentic Thai food for us and it was MMM.

We had a spicy whole fish, seafood curry, beef paneng and more. The level of spicy was just right for me, although Mom will definitely cook spicier! Everything tasted great, but I think my favorite was the fish. I can't wait to come back!",1
xzQzJTu47vNCYlpB8jdMaw,"A Cleveland institution.  Best place and diner to get breakfast anywhere in the city in my opinion (though Diner on Clifton is a close 2nd). 

But honestly all of their food is great.  Has that home-cooked, comfort food feel which makes you feel like you're at your grandma's kitchen.  It is always busy but you rarely wait too long for a table.  With your food coming out just as fast, without quality taking a back burner.

The only reason I really ever gert breakfast anywhere else is just to try something new, as I know George's will never disappoint.",1
xzQzJTu47vNCYlpB8jdMaw,"George's Kitchen is a great place to go if you are looking for a home-cooked, super cheap, greasy spoon kind of meal. My family decided to go there on Christmas Eve, and everybody had a good meal with friendly service.  I can't believe how reasonable the entrees are, not many things on the menu are even up to $8!  And pretty much everything comes with soup, salad, sides, etc. Portion sizes are large.   You can definitely find something decent to eat for around $7 per person.",1
y19xFolCozaRA-gGmHwkQA,"My experience here was very average, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.

It's a very Americanized flavor of Mediterranean food, but the restaurant was clean, the service quick and astute, and the overall meal was nice, if not a bit lacking in flavor. 

I had the chicken shawerma and a side of felafel. The hummus that came with the felafel was good, as was the felafel, but the hummus was just alright. 

Not a bad introduction to Mediterranean food, but I'd suggest a more authentic place to get some really great stuff.",0
Y8L-n2BUbCr31by8eYBazg,"My wife and I were visiting friends in Cleveland and she was pushing to find some time to relax and get massage.  Usually my rampant testosterone prevents such girlie adventures as ""Spa Days"" but it had been awhile since I had a massage and I knew it would do me some good.  

Our friends told us about Banya Tamazonka, a spa that has wet and dry saunas along with massage therapists on staff.  They also serve authentic Russian cuisine which I didn't expect but was a nice surprise being that my wife is a certified Yelp foodie freak and neither of us have ever had authentic Russian food.

Going into this I didn't really have high expectations.  I mean its Cleveland, not the Halekulani on the beach in Waikiki, but surprisingly enough it was very nice.  We started off by relaxing together in the saunas and followed it up with a massage.  The therapist was quite good.  I could tell she knew what she was doing and she had plenty of strength to work the knots out of my muscles.

It wasn't as luxurious as other spas I've been to, but was still well maintained, clean and inviting plus it was much more affordable.  They also had some unique touches I've never seen before like birch twigs in the sauna to help exfoliate your skin while you're sweating it up.  

We only intended to stay for the spa and massage but I was getting hungry so we had dinner there as well.  Diana the chef, prepares home cooked Russian food with some VERY generous portions.  If you do decide to eat there do it after the massage because you will be too full to enjoy one after you eat.

All in all a great little place to relax in Cleveland and would definitely go there again if I was in town.",1
yBHltbm3DqNaKgBgTMpxsA,"They have the best authentic cantonese style dishes on the east side especially if you don't feel like driving downtown.  Most of the menu is american chinese style take out food, but there are quite a few traditional cantonese gems that are prepared quite well. Fresh, made to order, usually fast and reasonably priced.  

Things to try:
Pad thai: cantonese influence
'wet' chow fun (which is actually ho fun - the flat rice noodles); dry chow fun is also great
Pan fried noodles
salt baked squid
yeung chow fried rice",1
yBHltbm3DqNaKgBgTMpxsA,"Americanized Chinese food.  We ordered five lunch specials, which included miso soup, noodle soup, General Tso's, sweet and sour chicken.  These came with fried rice and pork egg rolls.  We ordered take-out.  When I picked it up, the lady was very nice, and even rang the orders separately for our office.  She was very accommodating. The restaurant was clean and bright.  I liked it immediately.
My General Tso's was not spicy, and it was too sweet; however, it was NOT heavily battered like other Americanized Chinese places, which is a super plus for me.  The egg roll was delicious, but I did not detect pork.  I did not care for the fried rice, which had no vegetables or meat in it, and did not taste authentic nor Americanized.  It just tasted salty from soy sauce.  I would rather have plain brown or white rice, I think.  The other ladies really enjoyed their food and raved about the egg rolls.  Really, these egg rolls are awesome.  They are huge with plenty of filling, just right, and they are fried darker and are crispy. I like BBQ pork in mine, though, and I think these were veggie.  No matter, they were still tasty.
The prices are super cheap.  Next time, I'm ordering the chow fun (it's hard to find chow fun I like), or something less Americanized.  I recommend this place if you're in the Beachwood/S. Euclid area and are craving some Chinese fast-food.",1

yBsM_aIocvzLYIOSP5knjQ,"Visited this place for the first time last night. This is my old neighborhood and grew up right around the corner, so I'm super glad to see a small brewery open up here. Had their peanut butter porter and the Aviator IPA, both were fantastic. The porter had the distinct aroma of peanut butter and the taste on the palate was just as authentic. Following a porter with an IPA is difficult as I didn't give a chance for my taste buds to fully reset, but the hops were present in abundance with a nice piney aroma. Definitely not a west coast style IPA, but a style all it's own. This place has only been open for about 8 months and they have already nailed several beer styles in short order. I expect more good things from this awesome little microbrewery. If you're in the West Park neighborhood, do yourself a favor and pay it a visit. Cleveland is already, imho, a top destination for beer enthusiasts. This place just adds more proof to that opinion.",1
ygpvIw60wGri7cr3CA9Ipw,"This place has absolutely outstanding middle eastern food. I eat this kind of food often, and Jerusalem Grill is by far the best in Cleveland, if not in the Midwest.  Delicious, authentic baba (no parallel anywhere), excellent hummus, super tasty cucumber and tomato salad, airy and chewy pita, and savory eggplant are just a few of the delights. It's super easy for take-out. Can't wait to eat Jerusalem grill again!",1
ygpvIw60wGri7cr3CA9Ipw,"Got back from Israel a few months ago and had been tired of middle eastern food.  Today was my first venture back into it.

I had a Shawarma with Israeli Salad, Tachini and a little humus.  While you can't say it was ""just like home"" it comes pretty close.  If you want a more realistic sandwich ask for it with lighter sauce, they drenched mine (which still tasted delicious but authentic middle eastern food tends to be drier)

The owner told me on Mondays they have a falafel and soda for $5 which is a GREAT deal.  I spent $10 on a single shawarma!

Seriously, stop in here and have a bite to eat.",1

ygpvIw60wGri7cr3CA9Ipw,"Hit or miss. But when they get it right the food is delicious! 
They have a falafel Monday special not worth it... Definitely not authentic middle eastern tasting. Wish they put more effort into their food. And service is very mediocre.",0
ygpvIw60wGri7cr3CA9Ipw,"The hummus and pitas are really really good, that alone gets 5 stars.
I agree to D.M.W.'s review. We also ordered Shwarma Pita sandwich and it was huge looking yummy, although, it had small portion of meat and majority was salad. Wet and runny. Im sure they can make it better with a little bit of change.

After discovering their hummus and pitas, I can no longer enjoy the ones from Aladdin's Eatery. I am eating hunmus and pita from Aladdin's at this moment just because they are close to my house but oh so oweful. I miss Jerusalem Grill's!!

This place carries kosher/Islaeli food and Chinese food.
There is a Chinese guy/chef working there so the food can be authentic but I really do not get this combination.

To be honest, they should change their decor and clean the place. 
As soon as I walked in, I decided to order it to go.
This place can be a real big success if they know how to improve a little bit of there, little bit of that.
For example, they put plenty of hummus in a white plastic box (which doesn't really seal well) so it was already runnig out of the box when we got it and went bad within a day. If they've use a stronger clear plastic container which does seal, that would have been great.

But again, Jerusalem Grill makes very good pitas. I really recommend you to stop by to pick up their pitas for $3.5 per pack.",0
ygpvIw60wGri7cr3CA9Ipw,"Here is what you need to do- come on over to Jerusalem Grill, order falafel in some form (my husband prefers in a pita, my kid and I get the platter), add a side of hummus, don't skip the fries, and prepare for an amazing and authentic Israeli culinary experience! Do you prefer baba ghannouj? They do that quite well, too.

Jerusalem Grill has had problems with consistency over the years, but since I've given it another shot (over the last six months or so), their kitchen has put out excellent food regularly and the staff has been friendly upon every visit. So happy they managed to turn this place around!",1

yh0mvFCjZuMKy562h2_d_A,"If you love dining out and trying new places, Min Ahn is the place for you. This little Vietnamese place is about as authentic as they come and while it's not at all fancy or would be categorized as fine dining, it's definitely one of the greatest places in Cleveland and one that we go to often when we are heading to basketball games. 
I am in love with the spring rolls and the papaya salad and make sure to get mine spicy. So fresh and filled with flavors - fish, cilantro- pepper- etc. it's the perfect combination of tastes and flavor. As for the main meals, they have some great pho bowls and we always get the spicy chicken one to share. Most of my family gets the birds nest which is a mess of delicious chicken and veggies swimming in a spicy gravy atop a bed of fried noodles-Iike a birds nest. The gravy soaks into the fried noodles and it's the most delicious thing to eat.
As for decor, sort of plain and like I said, not at all fancy. Just some tables and chairs and some simple pictures on the wall. No problem as the prices and the food cannot be beat and really, that's the focus.
If you want some delicious Vietnamese food, head over to Min Ahn and enjoy.",1

Who? A party in my mouth that combine authentic flavor and freshness.  So many time I have been disappointed with authentic asian fare -either greasy, unclean (I found a wire in my rice once), overly priced and list goes on...
But I decided to try this spot with urging from one of my students and I thank you. 
I only had the veggie and tofu fried rice but I will be back!

The hole-in-a-wall kinda vibe somehow enhances the flavor... but it is just me. Whether the look of the place works for you or not, you will not be disappointed by the food. That is what brought you there anyway, right?",1
yh0mvFCjZuMKy562h2_d_A,"I absolutely adore this place. I discovered it in the 1980s when I lived in Cleveland and I am so pleased that I was able to stop here during my recent weekend trip.  The pho is amazing. I love the authentic quality of the place and hearing the family members speaking Vietnamese in the background. This place has a cool vibe. While it's not in the safest area the owners made it safer for customers by having parking in the back which is pretty much fenced in. When I stopped the flowers blooming in the backyard were spectacular. It can seem like a small botanical garden. It's also humorous to see the life-size cast rooster set up high in the garden. I don't know if this is for spiritual or practical reasons. Yeah, definitely a cool vibe.",1
yh0mvFCjZuMKy562h2_d_A,After living in the area for awhile I decided to try this place and I've been hooked every since. I love the fresh flavors and the options. Very authentic and nice and knowledgeable staff. If I lived closer I'd definitely go there more often.,1
yh0mvFCjZuMKy562h2_d_A,"Sadly, Minh-Anh continues to disappoint.
This is my third dining experience at Minh-Anh: 1 lunch and 2 dinners.
At all three dining experiences the overall quality of the food was fair at best and definitely not
fresh for most of the ingredients.
The Rice Noodles with Chicken Pho was too sweet, the lettuce looked and tasted wilted, and the chicken was oddly processed. Not even sure where they get their chicken - it was cut as if it was Spam and did not even taste like fresh chicken cut/pulled from the bone!
The Shrimp Spring Roll was ok, but I have had way better. And the peanut sauce had a gooey/sticky texture - not appealing visually or tastewise.
And what Vietnamese restaurant doesn't offer Bahn Mi sandwiches!!! Minh-Anh does not and that makes this restaurant in my book far from an authentic Vietnamese cuisine focused restaurant.
Having lived in San Francisco for many years, I have enjoyed the delightful and tasteful cuisine of authentic Vietnamese restaurants. Luckily, Cleveland does have two great authentic Vietnamese restaurants: Pho Thang Cafe on Superior in downtown Cleveland is amazing with wonderful Bahn Mi sandwiches and Pho soups, and the smaller Pho Ha Nam in the Asia Town Center has the best Summer Rolls and peanut sauce in Cleveland. At a higher price point, Bac in Tremont is also ok, but one has to be careful when ordering from their menu to avoid too much Americanization.
For real authentic Vietnamese cooking like you would find at the famed Slanted Door and other smaller Vietnamese restaurants in gourmet foodie capital of America San Francisco, please try Pho Thang Cafe and Pho Ha Nam - and avoid Ming-Anh and even overrated Superior Pho. You won't be disappointed with Pho Thang Cafe and/or Pho Ha Nam!",0

yh0mvFCjZuMKy562h2_d_A,"Recently went here for lunch based on the 4 star yelp reviews. Yelpers you did me wrong!

The service here is nothing short of sad. When I entered the restaurant there was no hostess waiting to seat me. So I stood by the cash register trying to get the attention of the employees for about 5 minutes before I finally decided to seat myself. After 10 minutes a waiter finally comes over. I'm excited by the prospect of finally getting to order some 4 star food, so I ask the waiter to recommend a dish. Guess what? He speaks no English! I'm not trying to be insensitive but when your clientele is predominantly English speaking, I think its reasonable to expect that the waiter will be able to speak English as well! So I had to wait another ten minutes for an English speaking waitress who recommended the stir fry noodles as their best, most authentic dish.

After about 7 minutes my food comes out. Kudos on the speed, but the kudos end there. This was quite possibly the NASTIEST ""Vietnamese"" food I ever had. It was a mess of grease grease and more grease. The chicken and shrimp were so overcooked that I had to take a chewing break. I was disgusted and even though I am not Vietnamese I was insulted that they would call this catastrophe Vietnamese.

Bottom line, waste of my time and poor taste buds. I will NOT be returning. The corner Chinese restaurant is better than this!",0

The noodles have the right correct context but they should be more flour-based. The beef and beef-balls are all cooked right. Overall, Pho at Minh Anh brings me home (mentally) :)

However, the spring rolls here are my disappointment. They should have pork belly and more type of herbs/vegetable in the rolls as supposed. The peanut sauce should not be that dense as well. 
Bottom line, if you want authentic Vietnamese pho, you must come to MINH ANH!",1

I'll keep it short and simple by saying it's the best pho I've had in Cleveland, and the closest to what I had when I spent time in Vietnam. For proof, my wife (who is from Vietnam) had something negative to say about all the pho in town, until we ate here. I can even say it's better than some of the pho I had in various cities in Vietnam.

I want to take off a star for the iced coffee, which wasn't really like Vietnamese iced coffee at all, but I just can't do it. It wasn't bad, but it lacked that strength and creaminess of authentic Viet-coffee.",1

That was the first time I had a fattoush salad and now it is one of my favorites.  I also ordered crushed lentil soup (was ok) it was a light liquid soup rather than a hearty soup.  A good combo to not feel miserably full after the meal.  They had several vegetarian items which was appreciated.

YiW3hYRpLKPhv99FkuZEbg,"I've gone to Nipa Hut three times now. I'm not particularly knowledgeable about Filipino food, but I will say that this place delivers on high quality food nonetheless. The restaurant itself is fairly small, lending to a fairly ""homey"" atmosphere that is very relaxed and comfortable. The entrees stand alone don't offer much of variety, so I prefer to go during their Saturday morning buffets.

The buffet itself is well worth the price. Tea is complimentary, and aside from that the buffet has a wide variety of meats, vegetables, seafood, and desserts. I find it very admirable that Nipa Hut doesn't hold back on authenticity, opting to serve dinuguan and whole fish (with bones) as part of their buffet options. Their spring rolls are very good, and taste homemade as opposed to store bought. The various stews and stir fry dishes are also great, though I can't say I know much about their names or what's in the dishes. The barbecue chicken, while simplistic, is deceptively good, having been smoked for very long periods of time.",1
YiW3hYRpLKPhv99FkuZEbg,"Hmmmmmmm
Went here with a good pal of  mine, fellow Yelper BJ A. For my first encounter with Filipino food. Expectations were  extremely high. Keep in mind we drove 4 hours into another state to get here. And it was a skiddish ride due to inclement weather. 
Lol. Of course i didnt know or recognize a single dish on the buffet line. It all smelled tempting. But some of the sites were intimidating such as multiple fish dishes that still had their heads n tails on. I did not not opt to try any of these n neither did my filipino friend so no brainer there. 
I thoroughly enjoyed any dish that had pork in it. The roast pork was a hit with me. Grilled bbq chicken skewers went down well. The main fair was garlic rice and i loved that. Best rice i ever had. 
My favorite thing on buffet line was mini pork egg rolls. I ate at least 20 of them
For  dessert we had hola hola. A unique concoction of ice cream beans corn n shaved ice. Was pretty good
Service was great!!!
Was an awesome authentic experience but im pretty sure you have to be Filipino to get the best experience here. 
Im gonna stick to Tacos!!!!!!!",1
YiW3hYRpLKPhv99FkuZEbg,"I love hole-in-the-wall-back-of-the-market places like these. Because for it to survive, it has to offer something more substantial than good setting/location/service - good food! I've never truly had filipino food, so I was happy to try what appeared to be a very authentic looking place. How do I know it's authentic? I came for the saturday lunch buffet and I've never had a buffet where it looked like all the dishes were homemade. As if I went to someone house and all the asian grandmas were cooking in the kitchen. And it had a decent amount of people - mostly filipinos eating in the restaurant. Another confirmation that it's legit.  I would love to return and order their desserts (the pictures of the halo halo look amazing!) and dishes off the menu. This place definitely deserves more attention.",1
YiW3hYRpLKPhv99FkuZEbg,"Delicious filipino foods!!! So glad to finally had gone to this place. Saturday from 1130am to 3pm they serve a delicious buffet of filipino foods. They dont make they same things everyday apparently but everything they had was great. Since moving to Cleveland for a little over a year now definitely miss my parents home cooking & this place just reminds me of home & how there's  always that variety of filipino whenever we have family parties. I was also able to order some halo halo dessert which was so delicious. There's also a store connected yo the restaurant so incase you need anything to make filipino food yourself at home you can purchase it from the store. Staff was great, lots of seats for family, price was very affordable. Definitely will be back here especially when i start to grave my home cooked filipino meal :)",1
YiW3hYRpLKPhv99FkuZEbg,"The buffet is great and the price is very reasonable. Very large selection. I come here to eat the Filipino food that I don't know how to make. I'm Filipino so this is the food my parents would cook when I was growing up. It reminds me of home.  

The grocery store also has all of the ingredients you would need to make any Filipino dish. I always make sure to pick up some mung bean hopia when I go there!",1
YiW3hYRpLKPhv99FkuZEbg,"I moved to Ohio from Los Angeles in 2016 and have been craving Filipino food for almost a year now. 
I grew up eating Filipino food because my mom is Filipino, and I know how to make the recipes but they call for specific food items you can't really grab at giant eagle. Nipa Hut delivered so well, 100% authentic, total pinoy vibes just walking into the store, great grocery selections, naynay's cooking!!! You can't really ask for more. 
I wish I lived closer to be able to make it a regular grocery shop, but I will definitely be stopping here for my uncontrollable Filipino needs",1
YiW3hYRpLKPhv99FkuZEbg,Excellent and authentic Filipino food and grocery items at a great price. I will definitely be returning. Try the chicken adobo and lechon.,1
YnvUFIZVvxsL5L4PEmWcUQ,"I stopped at the St. Rocco festival the other day on Clark & Fulton & tried a couple slices of plain cheese. I was very impressed. The dough tasted very fresh & it had that sweet buttery smell that I remember as a kid when my great aunt would make homemade pizza. Also the cheese was nice & gooey, kinda tasted like brick cheese that my family uses instead of stringy mozzarella which always slides of the crust. They also actually put sauce on it as well. I hate it when you get a pizza & there is no sauce on it. I want pizza not bland bread & cheese like a lot of white breaded Americans places prefer. I've had pizza in New York, philly, Pittsburgh, Chicago, Detroit, LA, San Fran, all cities with high proportions of Italians who know how to do pizza & from what I tasted the other day at the festival This is going to be go to spot from now on for your basic but homemade authentic pie.",1
Y-oPVMkxgEsve1sG2iDLXA,"Delicious, authentic and smartly sourced ingredients - our pies were very yummy! Though housed in a small space I hope to dine-in sometime. A wonderful addition to the Waterloo Art District!",1
Y-oPVMkxgEsve1sG2iDLXA,"OMG, Citizen Pie is the urban pizza of my dreams.

For starters, l love the bomb location across the street from The Beachland Ballroom. The inside of Citizen Pie is small, but full of amazing character. The neighborhood vibe is warm and welcoming, as if everyone knows each other...and the interior is cozily decorated with fun pop art and inspiring Andy Warhol quotes.

But the star of this show is their homemade dough. The dough used on their pizza is d-e-l-i-c-i-o-u-s. I'm not normally a fan of eating the crust on pizza, but this is hardly crust...its more like really, really good bread. The pizza also only takes 90 seconds to cook thanks to their 15,000 pound Stefano Ferrara pizza oven. This large oven, straight from Naples, cooks the pizza so speedily, that it actually takes longer to assemble the pizza with ingredients then to cook it. You can check on their website for their ""dough-meter"" to gage how much they have left daily, since its made fresh daily.

Onto the good stuff...the Mushroom pizza and Collinwood Supreme are both worthy of six stars. The glory of the Mushroom pizza is the thick brie and bacon (that zings it with flavor), and the Collinwood achieves the most awesome balance of sweet (Italian sausage) and spicy (green chile). There's no possible way their ingredients could be fresher. For dessert, try the tartufo, a delicious combo of ice cream, rum and chocolate.

Citizen Pie doesn't deliver, but I can't imagine that this shockingly authentic pizza would travel well. Once you try Citizen Pie, I doubt you'll ever go back to any other pizza. You'll lick the box clean.",1
Y-oPVMkxgEsve1sG2iDLXA,"Chef V is the guy behind some former Cleveland gems (Grovewood Tavern, and Americano). At some point during his Americano days he decided to immerse himself in the art of making perfect pizza. It was inevitable that he would open this restaurant specializing in authentic stone oven pizzas. Fortunately for the East Siders who he's spoiled over the years with his other culinary ventures, he decided to open Citizen Pie in the heart of the Waterloo Arts District in the North Shore Collinwood Neighborhood right across from the Beachland Ballroom. 

His imported italian flour based dough recipe, and other meticulously selected high end ingredients result in a pizza that is one of the best thin crust pizzas you'll ever eat. I have eaten all of the pizzas on the menu, along with a number of specialty pizzas and desserts. It's all great food. 

I almost exclusively order takeout because the place is small. And I order a couple pizzas because I love making leftover pizza and eggs the next day for breakfast. 

The prices are only slightly higher than most other joints charge for pizzas the same size, but the quality of these pizzas is hard to beat. The only other places in town with thin crust pizzas that come close are Crostata's in Highland Hts., and Bucci's in Middleburg Hts. 

Also it's kind of weird to see images of Communist leaders on an art installation inside the restaurant, and the left wing ""raised fist"" symbol acting as the restaurant's logo considering Chef V - being an immigrant from Eastern Europe - likely has a number of tales of the horrors of Communist Russia, but I have to assume he left the decorating up to one of the local lefty artist types. Oops!",1
Y-oPVMkxgEsve1sG2iDLXA,"This is the real deal - authentic Neopolitan pizza - and some of the best we've had in Cleveland.  We tried the Roman, the Mushroom and the Margherita. All stood out with a great char on the crust, a good amount of chew and flavors and toppings that did not overwhelm.  The combination of fresh jalepenos and Gaeta olives with the Burrata like cheese was amazing !!

Can't wait to go back. 

For some of the Yelpers down below asking for more toppings or 'make your own pizza' - not sure they realize what authentic Neopolitan pizza is. I'd have them go to the Wikipedia entry at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neapolitan_pizza.",1
Y-oPVMkxgEsve1sG2iDLXA,"The name alone evokes a lasting image of a radical theme from the turbulent 60s, and the walls are laden with pictures of some of the most evocative figures in history (e.g., Fidel Castro, Albert Einstein, Che Guevera). But as you sit down and stare curiously at the 900 degree brick oven, it is then that you realize the     effort that the owners put into this pizza establishment.  Most pizzas range in price from $13-$15 a pie and are ready in less than a minute ( I timed mine at 46 seconds) once they are fed into the scorching chamber of the oven.  The crust is slightly charred but not crunchy, it has a nice chewiness to it and is thin.  Because the pizzas here are authentic Napolitano style, they are only one size, yet large enough to satisfy the appetite of most adult men.  The hours also vary, because they operate until the dough runs out, at which point a sign is posted on the front door.  Overall, the pizza is spectacular and warrants a 5 star rating.  No frills, gimmicks, or cheesy (no pun intended) sales pitches - just phenomenal pizza that is worthy of endless praise.",1
Y-oPVMkxgEsve1sG2iDLXA,The pizza was great! The cheese was amazing and it tasted very authentic. Only drawback is that there isn't much sauce on the pizza but it was still very good! I would highly recommend for anyone who enjoys a good slice.,1
Y-oPVMkxgEsve1sG2iDLXA,"I'm a girl that really appreciates good pizza of all types, so I was very happy to find Citizen Pie.  The Neapolitan pies they bake here are among the best I've had in recent memory :-)

For me, what makes or breaks a Neapolitan pizza is the crust, and the combination of the incredible dough they make here and their 900-degree Stefano Ferraro pizza oven produces a crust for pizza aficionados to dream about!  It's baked with just the right amount of char, and it's neither soggy or too crunchy; instead it's superbly chewy, and stands up wonderfully to the delicious sauce (which has just amount of kick to it and isn't in any way too sweet).  Add to this the obviously premium toppings and I could easily eat CP's pizza multiple times per week. 

CP's space is small, but it's welcoming and warm with a great location.  The prices aren't cheap, but seem quite reasonable given the quality of their pies.

Like many other authentic Neapolitan pizza restaurants I've been to, it takes much longer for them to assemble the dough and the toppings than it does to actually cook their pies; once the pies enter the oven they're done in just ninety seconds!",1
YuNSmZLzstMSeU3O5qHhig,"Absolutely authentic German sausage of all types. Tubular delights that range from all kinds of brats, garlic sausage, mettwurst, landjaeger, weisswurst... you get the idea. They also make some of the best veal and pork pates you can find anywhere, and they have authentic German cold cuts. They'll also make stuff to order if you ask ahead of time. Wonderful place.",1
YVkcZQEfH0qQRtN86CoSDQ,"We really enjoyed this quaint little spot. The hand crafted, authentic drinks are on point. The service is wonderful. And the food is fresh, flavorful and unique.  I'm just taking away one star due to the valet boy who was on his phone while we sat in front of the restaurant for about 5-8 min waiting for him to take our car and for our food taking quite a long time to come out on the first night. We actually went twice while we were here in town. It's a must try while in Cleveland.",1
YVkcZQEfH0qQRtN86CoSDQ,"A hidden Brazilian gem on the east side of Cleveland.  This is one of those places you have to try early on before it gets too popular.  From what I hear this place is the place to go during the warmer months with its large outdoor patio, music, and drinks - however, having visited in the middle of December during one of the first snow downfalls, I can say the indoor experience was still well worth the trip.  Not your typical Brazilian barbecue restaurant - this place offers a wide range of home cooked dishes in addition to the typical barbecued meats.  They also have a mean Caipirinha and light appetizers in case you are looking for a lighter fare.

Walking into to this restaurant, I was a bit surprised at the coziness of this restaurant.  There is a small bar up front and a small 2 room dinning room to the side - can't of been more than 10 tables within the indoor dining area.  Not much space to wait up front or sit at the bar, but luckily we were able to be seated quite quickly.  I imagine on a busier night they would have to turn patrons away as there is not much space to hold people up front.

Started with the premium Caipirinha - get the premium, its worth it.  They use the Leblon brand of the liquor which has a better flavor.  And for those who don't like too sweet drinks - I would also recommend getting it with light sugar as the default pour is usually way too sweet.

For appetizers, we started with the shrimp and fried chicken.  The shrimp was definitely our favorite.  The chicken was good to munch on as well - we enjoyed the sauce pairing with the chicken.

For the dinner entree, went with the standard Picanha steak.  For those who visit the Brazilian BBQ restaurants, this is usually the house special steak which looks like a rounded sirloin cut.  In short, Batuqui nailed it - one of the best I have had - including a tour of Brazil last year along with frequent visits to Fogo de Chao.  They serve the steak on a sizzling hot plate (nice touch) which keeps it nice and hot though the meal.  The house recommends ordering one level lower than typical as the steak is sitting on a hot plate and will cook over time.  I still went with my typical order of medium and was very pleased with the outcome.  I always love how the Brazilians concentrate on the fundamentals for a good steak - quality meat, with light salt seasoning, and a perfect cook.

Wrapped up the meal with an order of the coconut topped cake.  Was very rich and was prepared very well - definitely a share dessert.

Overall, will honestly say I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and service level of this restaurant.  Does not have all the bells and whistles of your typical Brazilian steakhouse - but it delivers a strong punch with its authentic home cooked cuisine and its friendly staff.  Give it a try you will not be disappointed.",1
YVkcZQEfH0qQRtN86CoSDQ,Unbelievable restaurant. Small with an authentic feel and fabulous staff. Food was terrific. We will be back many times.,1
YVkcZQEfH0qQRtN86CoSDQ,"I love when a place has great service and great food! Charming restaurant with a very knowledgeable staff that serves up some very fresh and authentic flavors. Go, be Brazilian, and enjoy!   Can't wait to go back",1
YVkcZQEfH0qQRtN86CoSDQ,Having been to Brazil a couple of times this place took me back to the meals I would have after a day of training for soccer down there.  The food is very authentic and tasteful.  There really isn't anything on the menu that would disappoint.  I remember the first time going to Brazil and the first night we had a chance to head out into town to see the night life they told us to try their famous drink Caipirinha.  Good thing we didn't have a game the next day because that is one strong drink but very refreshing.   I highly recommend trying one here it is spot on especially in the summer on their very nice patio.,1
YVkcZQEfH0qQRtN86CoSDQ,"Good place with a good friendly atmosphere. Food and wine selections were very good. Luved the authentic Brazilian food. Good spices and very tasteful. Everyone is very friendly. Liked hanging out at the bar. Will come back to enjoy the outdoor patio and the Latin music. Would most definitely recommend this place. 
Thx 
DR MD",1
YVkcZQEfH0qQRtN86CoSDQ,"Thanks to this marvelous gem uniquely located inside the lower floor of a colonial house, you don't have to get a visa in order to try authentic Brazilian cuisine! The menu has numerous entrees, appetizers, and cocktails that provide a glimpse into the regional cooking traditions unique to the state of Brazil from which the owners hail. Since I don't eat a lot of meat, I went with the Prato Misto, a balanced yet delectable combination of beans, yucca, vegatables, rice, and seasoning that was a pleasure to eat! Next time, I will be sure to try to cheese  read and will definitely save room for dessert!",1
YVkcZQEfH0qQRtN86CoSDQ,Amazing place.  I came here with my wife and we had an amazing time. The food is very much authentic Brazilian and very delicious!,1
YVkcZQEfH0qQRtN86CoSDQ,I love this restaurant so much. This is our go-to restaurant when we have friends or family coming in from out of town. I grew up in a very Brazilian household and know what authentic Brazilian food is. Batuqui is incredibly authentic. I moved to Ohio a year ago from Los Angeles and even in Los Angeles we didn't have a Brazilian restaurant this good and authentic. Beautiful food and presentation. The atmosphere is great and the employees are amazing! You guys rock!!!!!,1
YVkcZQEfH0qQRtN86CoSDQ,I'm coming back for more! I ordered the Vegetarian Plate-Prato Misto and was really impressed with all of the different flavors and how they complimented each other.  That can only mean that the other dishes are the same.  I was dining with someone from Brazil and she said that the food here was very authentic and represented the cuisine of Brazil accurately.  Make sure you order the Caipirinha- a delicious and strong drink made with Cachaca (a liquor made from sugar cane).  The waiter was really cool too.  So patient and welcoming.  Impeccable service.,1
YVkcZQEfH0qQRtN86CoSDQ,"This is a lovely, homey Brazilian restaurant! The food is made well but is on the pricy side. The wait can be long and the restaurant is excruciatingly hot in the summer -- so Opt to sit outside if possible. If you want to try more authentic Brazilian food, go here instead of those steakhouse chains. Parking is limited to the street.",1
YVkcZQEfH0qQRtN86CoSDQ,"Fantastic restaurant with authentic food 
I'm not sure what the inside looks like because I've only been sitting in the outdoor patio area. I absolutely love dining here. The service is great. The cocktails are creative and strong. 
The seafood is super fresh. 
My favorite app is the Pao De Queijo. I could eat at least 3 servings of these. they remind me of Colombian pandebonos but less chewy on the inside and crispier outside. 
My favorite dish is the Mariscada. This is definitely comfort food. It is very creamy and well spiced. It is unlike any curry I have had before because it was a bit lighter than I expected. lots of seafood. I didn't really eat the rice that came with it. 
when I come next time, I definitely would order family style because the portions are very large and I don't like taking seafood home.",1
YVkcZQEfH0qQRtN86CoSDQ,"Okay, heres the deal, my GF, Gia, is Brazilian, and unfortunately C'bus just doesnt have any truly authentic Brazilian food, so we came across this place, and she said it was a must go, so I arranged the road trip and a nightover. 

This place is in a converted house. In the front room, they put in a small bar, with just a few 2 people tables...the rest of the seating were in the living and dining rooms. The place is tight. Even standing by the bar, you had to shuffle around when someone came in/went out.

The place is located near Case Western, and there were lots of students, both dining, and working there, including our strange hostess.

Place was packed, but we had 8:45 reservations so I thought we were good, but no...ended up waiting past 9:15, and they said little man could not sit at the bar, so we just had to stand around getting out of the way. The hostess said the problem was that since we had 3, we need a 4 place table, which were limited, and she was waiting for one of them to open up. I guess that sorta makes making a reservation worthless.

However, we were able to enjoy an authentic hand mortar-ed Caipirinha which was awesome!

So we finally get seated, and its sorta cramped and loud. Now thus far, youre prolly thinking this is shaping up to a 3 star experience, but wait, a star is born...  

And that star is the food!!

First, let me say everything was authentic. We started with Salgadinhos and Bacalhau...outstanding!

She got Moqueca Baiana, and I got Churrasco Picanha, perfectly cooked to med-rare...both were wicked awesome!

Little man got the Carolina's Pasta, which was also stellar!

The chef came out on the kitchen for sec, and to my delighted surprise, him and Gia start a convo in Portuguese! So cool! The language is sooo beautiful...even other guest were noticing and smiling!

Sooo, service, the wait, cramped, and loud, Im giving a 3, but the stellar food and experience gets a 10, so this place gets a solid 5 stars from this food impressed guy.

Would (and probably will) go back in a heartbeat!",1
YVkcZQEfH0qQRtN86CoSDQ,This is a pretty cool place! The decor is pleasant and they have authentic Brazilian food. I enjoyed a veggie dish while my mother had the chicken. The food was very fresh and it was cooked well. I really enjoyed our meal here. It is a bit on the pricey side but mostly worth it for the food and experience.,1
YVkcZQEfH0qQRtN86CoSDQ,"Those who know me know I am of Latin descent in my previous life. I love Mexican, Brazian, Columbian, Venezuelan,... ya the list goes on...
I often write reviews on Mexican and Columbian but it is time for Brazilian!

On one of the quaint streets of Cleveland..Larchmere area, sits in a cool old house... Batuqui!
Front yard patio for warm days and adorable little restaurant on the ""living room"" side and bar and a couple bistro tables on the ""dining room"" side.  Upstairs in not included in the restaurant as in Felice a few doors down the road.

It is owned and operated by Carla. A beautiful native of Brazil.
Her menu is authentic and boasting the genuine flavors of the country.  Comforting cuisine with a sultry flair.
Well designed meals ... seasonings and combinations to warm your heart and soul.

Only one or two drawbacks...
The bartender is unfriendly, distant and borderline Rude. Not a feather in anyone's cap because I can SPEND SOME MONEY ... IF I AM HAPPY and YA KNOW IT!
Secondly, as authentic as it is, dishes are over priced for the portions.  I tried a few items and seriously was disappointed by the portion vs the prices.",1
YVkcZQEfH0qQRtN86CoSDQ,"Their moqueca baiana was super delicious. It was rich of coconut milk and super flavorful. I don't know how they did it but the sauce went so well with the fish and shrimp. I couldn't stop eating. Moreover, my friends and I also ordered the diablo mussels. I just wished it was spicier. Unfortunately for us, we couldn't get the cheese breads. Will definitely come back for the cheese breads and different Brazilian dishes. I would highly recommend check this small restaurant out. So authentic and delicious.",1

YVkcZQEfH0qQRtN86CoSDQ,"I've had this place bookmarked for a while, but since crossing from the west to the east side is like traveling to the other side of the world I kept putting my visit off. Then Cleveland Independents Restaurant Week was announced and I just had to take advantage of this great deal! For $33 you get a three course meal. This is awesome because it allows you to sample some of the main attractions the restaurant has to offer and hopefully convinces you to come back to try more dishes. 

First off, Batuqui is located in a lovely renovated Victorian home so the setting is a mix of cozy and classy. Staff is excellent. This is a big deal for me. Maybe I am crazy, but the food, the whole experience improves when staff is pleasant and does their job well. I sat at the bar and David was attentive and friendly. I even got to chat a little with the owner, Carla. Her and her husband are both from Brazil but did not meet until they both moved to Cleveland! They have a passion for bringing authentic Brazilian cuisine to the area, and I'm talking grandma's recipes, not the chain Brazilian restaurants you see promoting all you can eat meat. 

I started off with the cocktail of the month, some sort of very strong pineapple and mint concoction $6 (happy hour price). For my appetizer I went with the Pastel de Carne. Similar to an empanada, but smaller and lighter. On their own just okay, but I asked for a dipping sauce and they brought out this cilantro lime? sauce and homemade hot sauce that really elevated the flavor. 

Next up was the main dish, Moqueca Baiana. Ohhh heaven this was so tasty! It's kind of like a coconut curry/creamy stew dish with shrimp and fish and served with a scoop of rice and fresh cilantro. They offered me this jar of hot peppers and oil to try and I am glad I sampled it before putting it all over my dish as it caught my mouth on fire. 

For dessert I went with the Coconut Butter Cake. Mmm what an excellent finish to a great meal! A thin slice of cake with toasted coconut, the perfect amount of sweetness. 

While they give you slightly smaller portions in the Restaurant Week deal, you still get plenty of food. I left stuffed and wanted to unbutton my pants. I don't know if it was the strong drink or the wonderful food, but I was passed out before 9pm that night! Today I am left wishing I didn't eat all of that stew so I could have a second helping! 

I highly recommend this place and will definitely be back to try more of their offerings! They have do have a patio and Spring is right around the corner...",1
YVkcZQEfH0qQRtN86CoSDQ,"Everything was delicious and well flavored. We started out with the cod croquettes - divine.  We also had the special which was chicken linguisa and yucca fries. The yucca fries taste like French fries and we loved them.  At this point we were filled and only ordered the Feijoada which is a mix of meats with rice and beans and collards and again the flavors were on point. We will definitely come back to try other things on the menu. 

In the restroom they have a host of family pictures on the wall. I think one of them is the owner in full Carnival regalia for more authenticity. Thanks",1
Ywdy4YARQK1ZWOCDzZDi-w,"The food was good but I am disappointed the ambiance.  I came here with my sister and mother and we thought this place was going to offer an authentic Brazilian favela experience.  Instead of being kidnapped and ransomed for millions of dollars by Brazilian criminals and narco traffickers, we were treated politely, seated promptly according to our reservation, and not terrorized whatsoever.  This is neither the east side of Cleveland nor the Brazil that I am familiar with.",0
Ywdy4YARQK1ZWOCDzZDi-w,"Just not my thing I guess, too bad because I heard authentic Brazilian is killer.",0
Ywdy4YARQK1ZWOCDzZDi-w,"First off, the food was great. No complaints here. Appetizers were excellent, main courses were very well done. We left content and happy. The atmosphere was really nice with Brazilian music playing in the background, low lighting, and little noise. Definitely a romantic place.

However, if you're looking for an authentic Brazilian restaurant, this isn't it. I lived in Brazil for a year and a half. Sarava's cuisine is more new-agey with some Brazilian thrown into the mix. I would say that about 50-60% really traces its roots to plates from Brazil. The rest of the menu looks great, just isn't Brazilian. If you've got a hankering for one of the staples, like picanha, feijoada, farofa, or pÁE£o de queijo you can kill it here. Other touches though, such as vinagrete and brigadeiro were not to be found.

Regardless, the wait staff was extremely attentive and polite. Service overall was excellent.  If I were back in the area I would return to Sarava.",1
Ywdy4YARQK1ZWOCDzZDi-w,"This place is a fantastic joint to lounge about.  Rich woods recall carpentry and decor from Brazil, and the music is definitely world-beat.  The occasional sculptures accenting the venue provide great sparks for conversation, and the menu contains many appealing sounding entrees.

The beverage list is not bad at all, although Xingu is becoming increasingly common -- and Caperinhas are similary becoming better known internationally.  

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caipirinha

I take issue with the food... it's not as authentic as could be ... This ends up feeling more like a fusion tapas place with an emphasis towards brazil... I find the flavours a bit tame, and a dearth of the dynamism of street food is supposed to have.

That said, it's still a great lounge.  If you've a festivity to celebrate, this place is conducive to a a memorable and lively experience.",1

We sipped on some sake and had a few appetizers before ordering some tasty sushi. I'm Japanese so I will say it wasn't exactly ""authentic"" but it was delicious! It's in a great spot in Shake Heights and the atmosphere is very nice. I would definitely recommend Sasa for a fun dinner out!",1
YyyqcbVyoBo4wPsgowUtUQ,"I really like this place...the people, place and things!!!

Welcomed by Eunice, the vibrant and personable bartender who can describe any item on the menu as if she created each and every one. She has passion and delivers it in word so you know exactly what you are ordering and how it will be presented!

Brenda, is the modest and down to earth owner who obviously enjoys what she is doing.  She offers creative and authentic cuisine with class and flair!  Her Chefs are talented and use the freshest ingredients from local markets and present dishes of art.

From the Beef Clay Pot which has tender little beef bites with a steamy hot broth (more like a stew) to the perfectly crunchy Beef Potstickers with delicate strips of cabbage.  I think it will be difficult to find negative comments here.

Have you ever tried Japanese Yams in a dessert?  A little darker and a little sweeter, they pureed this and wrapped it in a galette with candied pecans and cinnamon sugar.  Topped with fresh vanilla bean ice cream just dripping from the heat below, I just wanted to know why, oh why, I could not have another one.  Who cares about the calories?  So sad, this was the very last one made to order as it is a seasonal delight.",1
Z0c9-Eoxz7SQ__68bl3TQw,"This little gem is worth a visit.  I have been to this location through several incarnations over the past 20 years, starting with the old Salvatores.  It is not easy to successfully run such a small place in a busy restaurant district -- with no parking.

One way to do it is to have a limited menu and execute really well.  The new owner did just that.  On the surface, the menu seems small and similar to anything you would expect to find in Little Italy.  We ordered the meatball app, the salmon special and the chicken marsala.  Each item was great.  I mean really good.  The salmon was perfectly cooked and the cannelini beans were more flavorful than I thought was possible .  I won't go into too much detail on the chicken marsala with the capers because I don't want to give it away.  Just get it and then you will get it.

As for the parking, its Little Italy not Olive Garden.  You go there because of the authentic neighborhood vibe not the striped asphalt parking lot next to Target.",1
Z0c9-Eoxz7SQ__68bl3TQw,Very good and authentic Italian food. Calamari for appetizer was fresh. The fettuccine and scallops for dinner was amazing. And Best tiramisu ever.,1
Z0c9-Eoxz7SQ__68bl3TQw,"Food was okay, not a true authentic Italian experience. Service was subpar as we were asked three times prior to being seated if we had a reservation by three separate employees only to be left at the bar. Noodles were good. We needed to ask for bread.",0
Z0c9-Eoxz7SQ__68bl3TQw,"By far the worst meal I have had in Cleveland. I honestly feel really bad writing this, but I do want to prevent people from making the same mistake as me. I wen there with high hopes of a tasty authentic Italian meal. Instead, I was greeted by a half assed over-salted meal that beared some similarities to pasta. I really wished I had just gone to Olive Garden. On top of that, the service was horrendous. I really want to find a good Italian spot in Cleveland. I guess the search continues.",0
Z1mLBp6BMlHSQUh364vk1g,"Everything looked perfect on the plate---crab cake, slaw, roasted potato chunks on honey mustard sauce.  I took my first bite of the crab.  Too strange.  Something's wrong.  A second bite, then I took a closer look at the cake, breaking it apart with my fork.  Yes.  It looked like HAIR.  And yes---IT FELT JUST LIKE HAIR in my mouth.   Not a single piece, dice or chunk---just a matted mass of fine threads.  Probably made from the least desirable, lowest grade on the market---intended for restaurant use, but solely for flavoring broths, then discarded---not meant to be eaten.  But Blue Point shapes it into individual servings, then offers it on their menu as JUMBO LUMP CRAB CAKE.   

My first one, but maybe my last---from ANY restaurant---because of the lingering yech factor.  It was also my first visit here---and unquestionably my last.  Because I expected the results of at least MOST dishes tried, to be a notch or two above average---not below---for restaurants of this acclaimed caliber, I can't imagine wanting to try anything else from their menu.  There might be some great exceptions here, but after their HAIRBALL CAKE---and other misses---we'll never know, since we won't be returning.

      ting self.
 
BREAD   2 stars
Unremarkable flavor, with a thick golden-brown crust, which had already softened.  (Maybe a day or two old, plastic wrap just removed.).  I was starving, and would have stuffed myself if at least 4 stars.   Most untouched. 

NEW ENGLAND CLAM CHOWDER   3.5 stars
Surprisingly thin consistency---like soup.  Sprinkling of tiny carrot and potato cubes.  Teeny green bits---probably celery, parsley, other herbs.  Pretty---like confetti.  Their take on a refined style?  Maybe.  Or a cost-cutting move to stretch BP dollars.  Very nicely-flavored, but more of milk, some cream, and seasonings. No discernible clam pieces and very weak clam flavor---like a light peppery vegetable cream soup.   

RAW OYSTERS   5 stars
Expected.  No prep, except shucking.  

NAG'S HEAD GROUPER   4.5 stars
Pan-seared Black---their House Specialty.  Well-prepared.  Meager amounts of tasty braised spinach and flavorful Vermouth cream sauce.

LOBSTER MASHED POTATOES   2 stars
Had potential---if it had butter and cream additions instead of just BROTH !?   The potato's naturally dry mealiness begs for fats to flavor it and smooth it out.  If there was any, maybe a whopping quarter gram.  Very small lumps throughout.  Could have been lobster.  Maybe potato.  Maybe both.  Good lobster flavor, but unpleasant grainy texture.

JUMBO LUMP CRAB CAKE    minus 10 stars
Nearly flavorless, too.  But not the slaw!  Nasty...intense...inedible.  I never described it that way to C----, but asked what that distinct flavor might be.  He was agreeable, trying to help, but none of the ingredients (I'm familiar with all he mentioned) could account for the peculiar taste.     
 
""I've tried a number of dishes, but I've never had a crab cake---this is my first time....is this stringy consistency typical?...do other restaurants serve it like this, too?""  Uncomfortable, he nodded slightly, and took a deep breath.  He was also likely thinking, ""Oh, boy, here it comes.""  (I'm SURE I wasn't the only one who ever asked about that crab.)  I continued, just above a whisper,  

""From all I've read and pictures I've seen, crab cakes have pieces in it."" 

""Yes...uh...but we like to concentrate on presentation.""  Honest...almost verbatim.  Okaaay...  NOW, everything was coming into focus.  If there's little flavor and feels like you're rolling a wad of dog groomer clippings around in your mouth, it's good enough to serve.  Got it.  Taste...texture...irrelevant.  What really matters is how everything LOOKS when served.  

""I'm sorry, but I don't understand....the menu said JUMBO LUMP crab meat.  That's what THIS is?""  

Becoming flustered, maybe irritated, ""Well... if we did THAT...it would fall apart (holding his hands in the shape of a ring)...you know?""  2-3 seconds of silence.  I was speechless.  What sounded absurd was, in fact, the way they choose to prepare food here.  My suspicions were confirmed.  Appetizing appearance with unskilled, unappetizing results.  ""Can I get you something else?""   

I smiled, ""No thank you.""  I was finished playing BLUE POINTLESS---this dizzying menu word game.  By then I'd lost my appetite, and was getting a grasp on all I'd heard.  Maybe it was because I'm naturally pleasant and non-confrontational,  is precisely why he never offered to take the crab off the check.  Now---too late---I regret never insisting he do just that.      

CREME BRULEE    minus 2 stars
Sampled husband's.  Not even close.  I've made authentic.  Very pale yellow creme brulee has a distinctly unique, light silky texture.  Theirs is more banana-yellow heavy pudding consistency, close to egg custard.",0
Z2zynjhj6umPoHwLVfyOkw,"The problem that most reviewers have for this place is that they don't know what authentic Mexican food is.
Taco Bell, Chipotle, and all those other chain restaurants are generic and Americanized Mexican food. 
On that note coming from a Mexican, this is the closest I can get from not cooking it myself.
Atmosphere is kinda dark but there's privacy in the booths so you don't have to put up with over hearing others conversation.
Now there are TONS of different ways to make salsa and I like the one here because it has a small kick to it and it isn't chunky or too salty.
Food is pretty good, rice is dry at times but that's no problem, I've had worse. Additionally, the food isn't greasy at all.
(Greasy is when you go to a taco truck and you get the first taco after they just oiled up the grill and once you pick it up the grease drips onto your other tacos and runs down your hands. Now THATS greasy but it adds flavor in my opinion, so no complains here.)
Service is great too! They always treat me like family when I come in, attentive and quick to refill my drink no matter how busy they are.
So whenever I'm not in the mood to cook and I'm in ohio, then this is the place to go for a taste of home.",1
Z2zynjhj6umPoHwLVfyOkw,"Probably one of the worst Mexican Restaurants I have ever eaten at. I love Mexican food and have been to a variety of establishments. I opted Chipotle for some ""authentic"" Mexican food and that was a dissapointment. I walked in around 2:30p and the place was empty, should have been a sign. I didn't even look at the menu because I always order El Camarones a la Diabla. I ordered the aforementioned with guacamole. My main meal didn't come with tortillas, and it was not at all spicy. The rice was dry, and the salad combination it came with was miniscule. The guacamole was horrendous. It was runny and bland. The chips and salsa were a dissapointment as well. The salsa had no substance, and was runny as well. In my eyes this was very unaccpetable and I wish I would have just went to Chipotle...",0
z71cDtFTgwvT7ihsxesTzA,"I love Indian food. My husband and I have wanted to try this place out for a while now and finally were in the area. This street is full of great and awesome places. I think in order for this place to survive in such an environment, they would need to spice it up somehow. I mean literally. The flavoring was a bit bland. I understand a lot of us, Americans, do not like spice but authenticity needs to be there.  Set up is good. And service was great. Bring it on!",1
z71cDtFTgwvT7ihsxesTzA,"I love indian food. I would say I have so much of it that my blood probably has a curry smell to it. I came here with the expectation of great indian food, well at least averagely good. I was a little bit disappointed. While the food itself is mostly authentic the flavors were not. It is as if they are afraid of their own flavors. The chicken and beef I tried were marinated but lacked any sort of punch like curry or any decent garam masala would give it. Flavors all felt watered down to accommodate weaker palates. It loses its authenticity and flavor along the way. Not a good thing btw. The one thing that helped bring the flavor back into my bowl was an extra side of their spicy cilantro sauce which is quite spicy for those who can't handle spice. They need to step up their flavor if they want to compete with all the great food options nearby. Load up on the curry, cumin, garam masala and turmeric. Seriously. Bring it on. Don't dumb it down for us ""Americans"" make us meet you at your level.",0
z71cDtFTgwvT7ihsxesTzA,"My review isn't based on authenticity of Indian cuisine, but rather as a fast food restaurant that is a bit out of the ordinary lunchtime fare. My first impression was also a bit Chipotle-inspired, after all, one could have their food served in a bowl or with a wrap. I found the food to be inexpensive, flavorful, and healthy--certainly a lot less salty than its southwest cousin a few doors down. I've been here twice now and both times I have been greeted and served with a smile and pleasant people. Again, I can't speak to the authenticity of the Indian-style food, but it was an overall satisfying dining experience as a quick-serve joint that is perfect for lunch.",1
z71cDtFTgwvT7ihsxesTzA,"The Chipotle for Indian food! I can't say I've had enough Indian food to compare the quality or authenticity of it all. But, for the price of the food, I definitely was satisfied and had extra to bring home. I got the bowl with chicken and paired it with the coconut curry at the recommendation of the employee. So glad that I asked what would be good with the chicken, or else I may have had different opinions of the place. They have the veggies section, where you can add a number of veggies as you do in Chipotle. If you don't like spicy, DO NOT GET THE THAI CHILIS. My spicy tolerance level is quite high and even that was pushing it.  I love it because it adds the perfect touch of spice for me. I wouldn't recommend eating the chili pieces, if you can avoid them. They do not play.

If you haven't tried Chapati and are looking for a quick bit to eat, this is a place to at least try! It's conveniently located in Uptown, which means finding street parking, or parking behind the Barnes and Noble and walking across the street.",1
z71cDtFTgwvT7ihsxesTzA,"I was out running an errand to Fed-Ex when I came across the Chapati Indian Grill.Upon walking in the restaurant the decor was inviting,and the employees were very friendly.The manager on the other hand was very rude and kept interrupting the employee that was explaining the menu to me.The employee had to explain the menu because it came off as very confusing,and lacked description of what exactly I was ordering.I then ordered Chapatti to go with my meal.For those of you that are unfamiliar with what a Chapati is...It's an Indian flat bread(very tasty) what I received instead was a sham of a Chapati that was actually a tortilla made for burritos.I called the store to complain since I took my order to go,but the store manager was not in.I will look for an authentic Indian food experience at a another restaurant.",0
z71cDtFTgwvT7ihsxesTzA,"If you want spicy authentic Indian food do not go here.

Plus, the portion sizes are too small given their price point. This place has potential and I am eager to see how they improve!",0
z71cDtFTgwvT7ihsxesTzA,"It's okay. I concur with the Chipotle comparison, but I didn't find it close to authentically Indian. It was somewhat bland, the spices are not steeped in and immersed into the food as Indian should be, and the aroma of the food is nowhere close to authentic.

The staff is nice and helpful though, and they have a nice patio, and the Ice cream place across from it is totally awesome. Otherwise I'd try Chipotle.. Chipotle is tastier than this knock off.",0
z71cDtFTgwvT7ihsxesTzA,"The restaurant looks very professional and clean.
It looks as part of a chain. I guess the owner is dreaming to have a chain like Chippotle with Indian food, but the taste of their food has nothing to do with authentic Indian food. 
They have chicken that was cooked separately with almost no spices. When they add the tomato based curry sauce on top of that chicken, they call it butter chicken. I will call it 'The most fake version of butter chicken with no taste'. 
Also, they will give a 7 inch wide paper bowl with layer of rice at the bottom, then put some chicken on it and their tasteless curry sauce, plus some toppings !!! on top of butter chicken. You get everything mixed in a bowl. Their prices are higher than what the offer in the bowl.

I paid almost $9 for a bowl of rice with some chicken and some tomato lettuce etc.
I can have a Indian buffet for $10 that is full with authentic Indian flavors and lots of food choices. 

I am not going back.",0

ZcbGfZ0GYjvJp9xi5uE9KA,"Friendly staff and tasty food for a great price. The quality of the pizza is similar to pizza at Vosh in Lakewood, but half the price. Your pizza is customizable with toppings from egg to capers.

Definitely recommend!!!",1

zKJ4KcZAfTNBIM7OvkVv3A,"The rating I gave this place is for the ""cafe"" style Chinese food I get. Hence the name, East 30th Cafe. This place has the best Vietnamese Pork Chop with rice dishes ever. You get two large pork chops, an egg on some rice, and pickled veggies. I usually get this when I come, or one of the casserole dishes. It's reasonably priced too. 

If you want good authentic Chinese food, just take a quick walk inside to Li Wah (the owners are the same, so they won't be offended if you choose to go there). The dim sum there is decent too considering Cleveland dim sum sucks. 

Those of you who are reviewing this place for it's pizza, sushi, korean food, or any non-Chinese/non-Chinese cafe food, please go away. Why would you ever go to a Chinese restaurant and not order Chinese? You go to a Japanese restaurant for good sushi and a Korean restaurant for good bibimbap. It's common sense people.",1
zKJ4KcZAfTNBIM7OvkVv3A,"A delicious Chinese restaurant that is somewhat puzzling, since it is owned by the same people who run the Li Wah restaurant in the same building... and has overlapping menus, and sometimes, it even seems like the food comes from the same kitchen!
The food can be authentic or it can be disgusting, very hit or miss. Some of the items did not taste fresh. Maybe this is the place where frozen leftovers from Li Wah get reheated and served? The sweet and sour tofu was obviously very Americanized-style, excessively sweet and glazed in layers of thick sauce, worse than even some take-out places. But the mildly sweet tofu pudding was nice. 
The interior of this place is nice, although somewhat incongruous with the large screen TVs in one corner having ESPN on and the other corner with a Taiwanese soap drama.
Overall, this place is not bad, but has potential in improving the quality of the food.",0
zKJ4KcZAfTNBIM7OvkVv3A,"I took my mom out for her belated birthday dinner here only because she wanted to use the gift certificate she got from an event she attended. This place is fairly new in the Asia Plaza. It's near the store called Park to Shop in Chinatown. Plenty of parking spaces out and plenty of tables inside. The decor is very modern with traditional Chinese paintings. They even have karaoke. 

We ordered their sweet n sour pork ribs, mixed vegetables, and their  japanese tofu with xo sauce. The ribs comparably were different than other places I've been to. I didn't care much for them and the other two dishes were extremely salty with lots of MSG. The prices were overpriced and food selection is not that authentic. They also had an American menu with sandwiches you can order,  pizza, and so forth. A good plus is their sushi. I don't know if I want to come back because the sushi prices were a bit pricey. We had waters and the lemon wedges were not even an inch.  No lemon slices to squeeze. 

For a new place in town, they could also fix the spelling on their menus. That's kind of annoying. If you can't tell, I'm a grammar freak. After our meal, we had red bean dessert but it was so watery that I barely touched it. It gets 3 stars cuz it's just ok food, not the best or authentic.",0

They don't deliver, which was disappointing, But once I had the food, let me tell you, it was well worth the 5 minute drive. Id drive an HOUR for this pizza, it was bananas. It was like being back home in Brooklyn, authentic New York style pizza. They have deep dish as well if you're into that, but I can speak on it. Im not interested in pie as pizza. The Pasta was AMAZING, and they serve each meal with really great garlic bread. It was bad for my diet, but my tastebuds thanked me. We loved it so much we did a return trip the NEXT day. As an extra bonus, they remembered us when we called in our order. This is a great Pizzeria. We had no need to search for a new pizza joint for Friday night dinners.",1
ZL-4ejIO3DCgSsdRWwsX-A,"A legitimate slice of New York-style pizza is almost impossible to find in Cleveland. Why is that exactly? I mean, we're close enough to the East Coast that this really shouldn't be an issue. Especially not in 2018. Neapolitan, brick oven, Sicilian and even somewhat sorry excuses for Chicago Deep Dish are all available, yet our local pizza scene is seemingly devoid of authentic N.Y. style options. At least, that's what I thought, before trying Vincenza's. 

My husband and I recently made a pilgrimage downtown just for this pizza (during rush hour, mind you) and it was totally worth the drive from the Heights. We called in our order for pick up and it was ready in under 20 minutes.

The jumbo pie had a perfect cheese to sauce ratio, extra thin crust that was crunchy on the outside (yet had a slightly chewy center) and it was sliced large enough for each piece to be folded in half while you eat it. If you're wondering, yes, that last part is essential to enjoying a truly great NY pizza eating experience. 

They also had all sorts of individual slices available with a variety of different crusts and toppings, making it a great downtown lunch option, as well. The dining room was simple, but clean. 

Vincenza's is very much worth the commute, if you're traveling from the 'burbs, like we were!",1
zLLAm0whXDJlJAmmfXzyag,"Absolutely adored this little hidden gem - and I DO mean hidden.  I live at the Apartments just a hop skip away, and I was definitely still a bit befuddled about how you entered.  Don't let the confusion steer you away from a really delicious cappuccino, though!  You'll see the sign and a few steps up there's a back door that kind of looks off limits.  It's not!  You're welcome to enter!  Come on in!

There's a neat chalkboard in the entrance way where you can publicly declare your existence, love, or, in my case - just draw a really awkward picture of a coffee mug with steam coming out of it.  Oops.

Open the next door and you'll find yourself in a cute and authentic little relaxation area equipped with a leather couch, huge bags of coffee beans and some reading materials.  There is just one more door now that separates you from your first sips of damn good coffee and espresso.

The owner and his wife were there and they were super friendly and conversational with questions we had about their business.  They're mostly wholesale but they just do the little cafe for fun and enjoyment.  My cappuccino was seriously perfect from the temperature to the frothiness of the foam to the cute symbol to the perfect vanilla flavor.  Not too sweet but just enough to sooth the blunt taste of espresso.

Frank Sinatra sung it best - ""They've got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil"" - come give some of that tasty roast a try!",1

ZPAkg2phFo_p3U-QjvHVPw,"Mama Santa's is an old school authentic Italian restaurant. My family grew up on Murray Hill so this place holds a certain sentimental value.  Any time I am in Cleveland I make it a point to go to Mama Santa's for some homemade cavatelli. I would suggest the manicotti and cavatelli! Mmmmmm... Oh, get sausage and meatballs too! And ask for some sauce to dip the bread in!! While Mama Santa's makes a decent pizza, their pastas are where it's at. ;)

This is NOT a corporate commercial establishment so if you like the Olive Garden or Pizza Hut, you should know that you will not find that type of food or service here. Mama Santa's uses fresh ingredients and makes most of their food by hand. There are no 'additives', 'preservatives' or other crap in their food. If you're a commercialized idiot, this place is not for you. 

I see reviews who slam Mama Santa's for being an old restaurant...well, that's what it you dummies. This restaurant has been family owned for generations, just like Corbo's and Presti's. Yes, the restaurant is historic, it's in Historic Little Italy. Yes they have old Italian tablecloths....duh, it's an authentic traditional Italian restaurant! If you don't like family restaurants, take your ass to Olive Garden and eat prepackaged food made by Cysco Foods where you will pay way too much for nasty food but hey, you can sit in a building which costs 300 times as much to own and maintain. 

Mama Santa's isn't just open to make money. They provide family style food in a family atmosphere, something it would appear most people could use a lesson in.",1

I'll admit the prices can be a little steep- initially it doesn't seem like it because the base cost of the pizza is pretty cheap, but every topping you add is pretty expensive- but it is so worth the cost! The authentic Italian vibe adds to the overall experience and I'm a huge fan of the homemade sangria the restaurant serves. Unfortunately, during dinner hours the store can be packed busy and I've even seen a line out the door at some times so finding a good off hour is very helpful.",1

ZPAkg2phFo_p3U-QjvHVPw,"I've noticed that for every 4 or 5-star review, there's a corresponding 1 or 2-star review.  I guess, then, a potential diner should go without expectations, but don't be surprised if it's terrible either.

Here's the deal:  I've been here a few times because 1.) it's cheap and 2.) it's cheap and you get a lot of food (typical cheap pasta joint).  To me, inexpensive is GOOD, so it gets an extra star just for that.

I would say I'm a bit of a pizza connoisseur and critic, especially when it comes to a LIttle Italy neighborhood.  I've had outstanding pizza and average pizza across the U.S. and in Italy.  Verdict: This pizza is mediocre.  It should not be in Little Italy.  I really think that people who say it's good are simply inexperienced when it comes to the joy of quality pizza.  If I want a cheap, inauthentic pizza, I will go to my grocer's freezer, and ultimately be more satisfied by the taste.  The sauce, the cheese, it's just plain bad.  The service, too, has been under par when I've gone.

Get a sandwich instead, but I don't recommend the marinara.  Oh, and that reminds me, the bread they serve is not even good.  I wouldn't be so critical if they weren't in the Little Italy neighborhood where patrons have expectations of quality and authenticity.",0

If you want an authentic Italian food experience that's made with the same love you would experience from your mother's kitchen, Mama Santa's is the place to be. Not only is their pizza the best in Cleveland, but their homemade pastas, meatballs, and sauce are the best you'll find in Little Italy. 

But first, let's get to the pizza. You know when you travel to other cities and tell people you're from Cleveland, and the first thing they mention is Mama Santa's pizza you've got something special. They make some of the softest dough you'll find, with great sauce, cheese, and toppings. The toughest part about eating a Mama Santa's pizza is not eating the whole thing yourself!

Make sure to try other things on the menu too like the veal scalopinni, homemade cavatelli with meatballs, and even the T-bone steak. I highly recommend anyone in Cleveland to visit this gem. There's a reason they've been around for over 50 years!",1

ZPAkg2phFo_p3U-QjvHVPw,This place is family friendly. It also was my go to for authentic little italy pizza pie. It's good friendly service even if the pizzas (that's all I've tasted) is a bit on the brown side.,1
ZPAkg2phFo_p3U-QjvHVPw,"Great pizza, authentic atmosphere in little Italy.  Very affordable!",1
ZPAkg2phFo_p3U-QjvHVPw,"I admit that I haven't been here since maybe 2+ years ago. When I first moved to Cleveland, I heard this was THE place to get pizza. I lived near Little Italy and man, every time you pass by this place during the weekends it is jam packed and looks like quite the hot spot. You can even order to go through that little peep window! Very busy, crowded place it is. 

And for what? Well, I'm not really sure. The pizza is quite...umm..how shall I put this nicely...crappy. Certainly not authentic, and certainly not anywhere near the rankings of the best pizza I've had ever. In fact, I think this is worse than Pizza Hut- I have to agree with another yelper on this one. 

Now remember, it's been a couple years, but the only things about this pizza that stick in my mind (and not in a good way) are the canned mushrooms (what the heck is up with putting canned mushrooms on a pizza?!) and the gummy, low-grade cheese. That stuff is thick-gooey icky. Fine, maybe the cheese can stay, but the canned mushrooms are inexcusable. I think they use fresh mushrooms even at the fast food cheap places! What the diggity! 

And that, my friends, is why I have not returned to this establishment. I would rather use my pizza stone at home and make my own food.",0
ZPAkg2phFo_p3U-QjvHVPw,"This is an old school Italian Restaurant with the prices to match - a real gem!  I was in a party of 5 and we were all hungry for pizza.  We were told by the locals to come to this Little Italy landmark for authentic ""Cleveland"" pizza, so we went across town from Westlake to Mama Santa's.  The owner welcomed us like we were old regulars and we settled into a table.  Barbara, one of the friendliest waitresses I've had, came and took our order for a few beers and a bottle of wine.  A couple of us wanted anti-pasta but she said we could get a large, share it with the whole table, and save some money.  She also helped us with the pizza order and explained about how the pizza dough is made daily along with the tiramisu and cannoli.  The couple at the table next to us had also driven from Westlake and they had been regulars for 30 years.  They said they made the drive a couple times each month.  The pizza did not disappoint and the tiramisu and cannoli was the best I have had since South Philly about 30 years ago.  We all had a great meal at a low price and a good time - we all said that we would be back on our next trips to Cleveland.  The only negative is that they do not take American Express.",1
ZPAkg2phFo_p3U-QjvHVPw,"Hey! You talkin' to me?

That's the kind of old school, Italian attitude that I think of whenever I visit Mama Santa's. No frills, good food, period. 

At Mama Santa's, it is what it is--an ancient pizzeria with sassy, middle-aged waitresses who just want to do their job. I walk in knowing that I might not have the nicest server, but I'm going to mow-down some damn good pizza that's for sure.

I really don't think this place has changed its decor since the day opened, or at least it doesn't appear so. But you know, I kind of dig it. Yea, I know the ambiance isn't much, there aren't any windows and everything inside looks like it's from 1920. So what? All I'm saying is that if I want a fancy, Italian meal, I'll go to a nicer restaurant. There are tons to choose from in Little Italy. 

I come to Mama Santa's for a laid back experience and some bomb-diggity, authentic pizza pie. Thinner crust, traditional ingredients, simple, perfect. I have to say, I really like their sauce too! I've actually ordered pasta and was way more than satisfied. 

Hey, maybe my palette simpler than others, but my tastes buds know what's good. And they say Mama Santa's is a great spot to sit and enjoy some 'zza. Enough said. 


....now get outta here!",1
ZPAkg2phFo_p3U-QjvHVPw,Good traditional Sicilian food. Great service. Very reasonable prices. 60 years of continuous service by the same families and time tested recipes. I took my mom there from the Cleveland Clinic and she loved it. She worked part time for a family owned Italian restaurant back in NY and she felt it was very authentic.,1
ZPAkg2phFo_p3U-QjvHVPw,"They burn pizza like nobody' s business! Seriously, i think all the Mama bashing is a bit much. The pasta fagioli is hearty. The drinks are affordable. The atmosphere is cozy and basement-ish(like Polish Village in Detroit-that's not a bad thing). And one of the people burning the pizzas back in the day used to be a dj from the Chamber. I guess that last tidbit was pretty useless. Also, my mom used to wash dishes here when she was fresh off the boat back in the 70's. So at least the dishes were clean three decades ago.

It's cheap,casual and homey. Good enough for me and adds some authenticity to the high falootin' yuppified neighborhood. I'm gonna pop in on Columbus Day and get a burnt pie, yum!",0
ZPAkg2phFo_p3U-QjvHVPw,Best pizza on the east side. Sicilian style thin crust authentic. You have to try the spaghetti.  It's home made and with a meatball it's perfect with the sauce that is really authentic too. Best service from all especially Deb. I would really miss this place if I couldn't come here anymore. Deb treats me like a king every time I'm here. A little Italy institution.,1
ZPAkg2phFo_p3U-QjvHVPw,"I moved away from Cleveland, but I often sit in my Los Angeles kitchen and crave Mama Santa's pizza. There is nothing like it here. It is a buttery and crisp crust, with a light tangy sauce. 
I have been there hundreds of times and was never wiling to try anything else. I had to save room for the pizza! But this Thanksgiving I went home and straight to Little Italy. Feeling adventurous, I tried something new. I have never had such amazing homemade noodles! Why had I never tried them? I got the thick spaghetti noodles that look like linguini and taste like the ones my Dad makes. The sauce is thin and authentic, and I loved the meatballs... but it was all about the noodle really. Go in. Try those home made noodles. I think they are called CASA, but you have to ask for them or they will give you the store bought ones.",1
ZRLmQ3oAuspAkk5R6BOfyg,"This is my favorite type of place: friendly, genuine, local, authentic, sophisticated, and casual. I was there for lunch by myself recently, and sat outside on the patio, which was gorgeous. My server was a super nice woman who complimented my backpack and gave great service (warning me away from a double or triple IPA that was on the menu - she said if I had that with lunch I wouldn't be doing much else that day). 

I had a salmon entrÁE©e which was cooked absolutely perfectly, just on the rarer end of the spectrum and moist, with delicious crunchy skin. It was on a little polenta cake and grilled peppers with grilled jalapeÁE±o, and a strawberry on top which at first I found slightly incongruous but wound up thoroughly enjoying. 

Fat Cats is a definite gem.",1
ZSnAyj829ZcaGGxs-6sArA,"First, this is not affiliated with the other Luchita's in the area.  Not sure if the owners are related...they may be.  I got a weird answer from the owner when I asked so I think there's something to it.
  Anyhow, I was happily surprised by how much I liked their food.  I am NOT a fan of American ""Mexican""...dumbed down.  After reading every review and every Mexican restaurant menu everywhere on the internet I decided to give this a try as I became overpowered by my Mexican craving and this is right down the street from me (and no, I didn't go on Cinco de...)   The atmosphere, while certainly not upscale, made me feel like I took a drive south of the border.  I loved it!!!  The owner and our waitress were exceptional in customer service and attentiveness!  I really appreciated them!  For me the food had an authentic spicey taste.  I had the queso fondido and a mexican taco for my meal. The queso definitely lacked the proper amount of cherizo, but overall I was satisfied with it...it just had really good flavor and was creamy gooey juicy wrapped in the tortilla.  The shredded beef Mexican taco was perfect in flavor, wrapped in the hard corn tortilla.  The shredded beef was so flavorful (could always be more spicy for me).  My palate was satisfied!!

Overall, I'm really happy I decided to give this spot a try.  It doesn't look like much from the road, or really inside, but it is a fun place to go and relax with good Mexican food.

Per the owner, he's working on getting a website up!  I'll look forward to that soon.",1
ZspvlO5Dvtd517YhVLJJ_A,"Great authentic sushi. Atmosphere was great. The food was second to none. Outstanding hospitality. The owners are very friendly. 

There soups are the best I have had. Hearty. Full
Of flavor.  Only the freshest ingredients and fish. The chefs put on a great show too!

Highly recommend this awesome establishment.",1
ZspvlO5Dvtd517YhVLJJ_A,"Disclaimer: I did not come here for the Hibachi, but just for regular kitchen food and sushi.

Store Layout (4): If you didn't know, this restaurant/hibachi/club/lounge is 5 stories high. Apparently the building has been vacant for almost 10 years before the owner bought it. Hoping that this would be a place for all activities, each floor has its purpose. There's a clubbing floor, a lounge floor, hibachi floor, sushi floor, etc...

Reservation (2): We made a reservation for 12 people at 9PM. When we arrived there, we realized they messed up our reservation and thought that our reservation for for 6PM. LUCKILY, the restaurant was very empty when we got there and we had no problem getting a table. But once our table was set for us, the hostess never walk over to us (we were by the bar) to tell us it was ready until we asked if our table was set!

Service(3): Completely hit or miss. We had a big table of 12 so 2 waiter/waitress served us. My waiter was absolutely amazing, being on time and checking back on us at the right time. However, the other half of the table had horrible service, where their food didn't come out until we were done with ours and their water didn't get filled in time, etc..

Ambiance (3): I walk in thinking this looked like a classy place. But then the staff are all fairly laid back so it's almost a casual restaurant with a classy look?

Kitchen Food (2): I ordered the beef teriyaki. Not that the food didn't taste good, but more just that it was UNauthentic. The teriyaki sauce was way sweeter than I like and it's hard to explain, but the dish wasn't the way I pictured it (even how it was cooked?)

Sushi (4): Not too bad. The sushi is fairly fresh, but being a restaurant located downtown just across the Bingham, you can imagine the size of the sushi vs. the price. It was fairly expensive for the amount of food you're getting. But i guess it's too expected.

Overall (3): There are other sushi restaurants I'd prefer over Tomo. I haven't tried their hibachi yet but it's hard to imagine there's a huge difference in flavor and taste for hibachi restaurants.. I'll be back here again to try the hibachi!",0
#NAME?,"This is one of Cleveland's crown jewels -  nowhere else will you find a selection like this.  I grew up with ethnic food, and it's great to still have a source for authentic meats and pastries.  Fresh sauerkraut served from a barrel...  the most amazing pierogies you'll ever have... and lest we forget the best of all, Vera's bakery and her Russian Tea Biscuits.  Heaven.",1
#NAME?,"Food: find specialty meats, cheeses, desserts and ready-to-prepare foods here. Find a tasty snack for now, or buy some Delmonico steaks for later. Smokies and French macaroons are my go-to. Definitely more specialty items though, you won't accomplish your full grocery list here. In the produce annex, you'll find tons of vendors with your basic to exotic fresh fruits and veggies. Prices are comparable to that of a grocery store, and you support local vendors! 

Atmosphere: I mean, this is a cleveland must-see. The cornerstone of the bustling Ohio city, its a popular place to get some groceries, try new foods, or just walk around. The beautiful brick ceiling and tiled walls tell the story of its past and make the space feel authentic. It is a market, so it's very crowded, especially on the weekends. I would not recommend going with a group larger than four unless you plan on splitting up. It's hard to stick with people in the cramped space with small aisles.",1
#NAME?,"I absolutely love the Westside Market. The whole feel of the place is amazing. It's culturally diverse and everyone is friendly. 

The fruits and veggies are in abundance, whatever you want... Here, The possibilities are endless. However, I have yet to get one of their ""World famous"" sandwiches due to lines throughout the entire market. One day I will, one day. The huge bull horns hanging are an awesome addition, in my opinion anyways. 

Looking for good, authentic, home made food? Come here. Beef jerky, Mediterranean, cheeses of sorts, pickled errthang. 

Very enjoyable, fast paced atmosphere. Check it out!!!

Eat in too at the West Side Market Diner. Great for curing hangovers or exhaustion from all of the excitement you may have just experienced at the Market.",1
#NAME?,"Stop what you are doing right now, get in the car and go to the Westside Market.

The Westside Market has been a staple in Cleveland for as long as I can remember.  It is the oldest public market in the city and is a must see.  The vibe and old building takes me back in time.  

I load up on fresh fruits, veggies, meats, bread and cheeses and spread all of the deliciousness out at home for friends and family to enjoy.  I can not think of a better way to spend the day than shopping at the WSM and then enjoying a wonderful spread watching football.  The various vendors are friendly and will give you great advice on new things to try.  Don't be afraid to ask questions and haggle a little bit on the prices.

The Westside Market is authentic Cleveland and a must see spot.",1
#NAME?,"I love West Side Market! However, it does have strengths and weaknesses, when I compare it to other markets like it.

Strengths:
- Meat: lots and lots of meat
- Cheese
- Bread
- Dessert + baked goods

Weaknesses:
- Produce (I don't get why so much of the produce here is imported or has stickers on it. I really expected more of a farmers market feel, and there are a couple of local farms represented, but it's overwhelmingly inauthentic and sketchy produce of mixed quality.)
- Ready to eat food! Basically if you want something more than a pastry, your options are crepes, bratwurst, pizza bagels, or greasy bfast sandwich. Some places will microwave their stuff for you if you want to eat it right away, but there's not much of a selection so once you've been a few times, you've tried it all. 

Obviously, it's a must visit if you've never been. I like to go every week if I can to try other things, but it's helpful to know what you want because it can get crowded and hard to browse.",1
#NAME?,"I LOVED this place! There was so much to see! 
I will say there was a lot of meat stands, so it made me want to move to Cleveland so i could come down to the market and pick up meat for my bbq. I did love every corner! One hidden gem is the falafel stand in the back corner, it's so worth it! The fresh falafel and hummus, were a win!

Some other great finds was the Asian stand, great prices for authentic food! One of the best chocolate chip cookies I've had was at Mrs. Caroline's cookies, and the pastry shops where amazing. I wanted to try them all!",1
#NAME?,"I love the fact that you can get produce from local vendors all year around.  I came here on a Saturday morning, and the place was bustling with customers.   Great authentic selection of anything you can consume!  If you have a chance, it's worth checking out market garden brewery next door.",1
#NAME?,"One does not simply walk into West Side Market... 

There's so much to see here! You can walk in craving one thing and walk out craving another.

It's not just the diverse foods options either, it's the diversity of the people selling the food that really makes the experience. People from all walks of life work here. A server can completely talk you out of buying a certain kind of pasta or dessert or whatever and guide you towards something more to your liking solely based on casual conversation! There's something very old-school about that. As such, visits to West Side Market can lead to discovering authentic foods, ingredients, and human interactions.

The lanes between kiosks can get quite full and maneuvering through crowds can sometimes be an issue, but something about that hecticness adds to the fun and thrill of being in this crazy, big bizarre of a market.",1
#NAME?,"I am surprised by the number of great reviews on here ... we made a special trip while in Cleveland to visit this market after seeing some cool pictures online. It turned out to be a wasted trip. First of all, many of the booths we wanted to visit were closed. We went on a Sunday and it seemed that was an off-day because there weren't many people around and by 2 p.m. everything had closed.

Maybe this is more of a place for locals who want to buy meat and produce. The meats looked really good but any snack type foods, etc. were just sort of blah. We tried a few sweets (macaroons, cookies, cake pops) from stands and they were average at best. Many of the stands offer foods which they reheat in a microwave oven such as pizza bagels, British pasty pies, etc. Cold in the center, too chewy on the edges ... this place could do way better for warm foods.

Maybe I have been spoiled by places like Pike's Place Market in Seattle, Reading Terminal Market in Philly, The LA Farmer's Market or Faneuil Hall in Boston but Westside Market seemed grimy, the variety of the stands was horrible and many of the stands served grammar school bake sale quality sweets. It was also super expensive.

Perhaps the worst stand of all was the one which served 'authentic' Irish and British foods. I ordered a Scotch Egg because I was just in London and love those. It cost $5, which is fairly expensive for what it was, and was so gross I threw half of it away. They used an already hardboiled egg, instead of the traditional soft boiled egg, before frying it which basically made the egg as hard as a rock. Lazy. Then, they rolled it in a gross sausage and panko breadcrumb mix. They fried it in old oil (you could taste it ...) and stacked them in a bowl. She microwaved it (for 30 seconds too long) and then shortchanged me by $1. I'd have paid $6 not to have eaten half of this monstrosity.

Parking was easy and cheap. You get 90 minutes free and then pay $1 per hour after. Pretty amazing considering most cities charge $5 per hour, at the minimum. The only saving grace to this grimy, filthy place was the vegetable/fruit stands. Although the sellers are like carnival barkers and tend to have about 50 yards of all the same stands, the produce looks fresh and they hand out little samples. They had the biggest artichokes I have ever seen.

Overall, if you are looking for meat for a BBQ or produce, this is a good spot although a little overpriced vs. a local butcher or farmstand. If you are a tourist, I'd skip it or plan to spend 30 minutes - 1 hour tops here. This was the worst public market I've been to ... and I've seen a few.",0

#NAME?,"Being a big fan of Mediterranean food, I am always looking for an opportunity (excuse) to eat at a restaurant that offers my favorite type of food. When work sent me to Elyria, and lunch time was near, I checked Yelp and was pleasantly surprised to find the Gyro Kebab House as an option. Now I had no idea if the restaurant was any good, but for Mediterranean food, I was willing to take the chance. Conclusion: I was very pleased. The food was prepared a bit different from other similar-type restaurants I have been to, but I often find the uniqueness, even if slight, refreshing. The building is a bit older, but the food was great. Now I am American so I can't speak to the authenticity of the food, other than to say it was authentically delicious.",1
#NAME?,"This is such a great addition to Elyria!!! Food is delicious and authentic, service is out of this world, and the owner is passionate about his restaurant and his patrons!!

Finely ground garbanzo beans and spices in a patty perfectly fried. So good! The Cigar rolls were feta cheese, parsley and dill rolled up in Phyllo dough and fried. My favorite of the evening! I had the Chicken Kebab which came with rice and small salad. The chicken was tender and juicy. My husband had the Chicken Kebab with Yogurt. His was a thinly sliced chicken in a tomato sauce served over soft pita chips and yogurt. Both plates would have fed two people! The owner greeted us as we entered and gave us some small tastings of what they had to offer. Delicious. A must try is the Cacik sauce. Similar to tzatziki sauce but oh so much better! He was our guide thru his menu and a total gentleman.",1

I think its a little expensive for mediocre viet food.  Of course I am a harsh critic when it comes to viet food, since I compare everything to my family's cooking.",0

#NAME?,"We had reservations to celebrate our son's birthday. We do not live in Cleveland and our son had heard about the restaurant and wanted to go. My wife & I read positive reviews for this restaurant, so were excited for something unique. 
We arrived for our dinner early, and they seated immediately, which was surprising.  One of the staff came to the table, and without introducing himself, just started rattling off the evening specials. When he left the table, all 4 of us looked at each other puzzled that we might have caught maybe a few of the specials, but missed most of what he said. He also was looking all around as he was speaking. Very impersonal.  Another person came for our drink order. The first person came back and we wanted to order an appetizer and enjoy our cocktails. The waiter wanted our entree order at that time.  By this point I was feeling a a little rushed,  the restaurants website talked about a relaxed  dining experience.  
We had a very hard time carrying on a conversation due to the loudness of the room.
RIght after the appetizer was delivered, they brought the house salads.  The appetizers that we ordered were edible, but nothing exciting. 
The salad was generic & boring and was drenched in a house dressing which tasted like thousand island dressing. A bus boy stopped by the table and asked if I was done, and I said no, and then reached over and took my plate. Once again, we were getting the feeling they just want to turn tables.
The entrees arrived. I had ordered the paella, my wife the Chilean Sea Bass, our son ordered the goat special and his girlfriend the stuffed chicken breast.  
Now we did not ask them how their meals were, but for what I paid for our meals, this was just average. The paella was just ok, and I was really disappointed as I hadn't had paella for many years.  My wife said her Sea Bass was overcooked and rubbery, and had a tasteless sauce underneath it.
I again read through some reviews and we can't believe that the occasional person would rate this as excellent. This was far from authentic. Bland vegetables arrived with our entrees. The place was loud, cramped, service was rushed, and the food was way over priced for the quality. 
I look forward to good dining experiences, and this certainly was not one of them. Mallorca will not be on a second try list.",0
#NAME?,"A few friends wanted to meet for lunch downtown and we are so glad we went here.  The location is a quick walk from Public Square in the trendy East 4th Street closure.  One disclaimer about parking: I parked at the 100 Public Square lot for a little over an hour and had to pay $11.  I was told by the friends I met that live downtown that this is the normal price range for the area, but it caught me off guard.  If you are looking for some authentic audial/Viennese food this is your stop.  The service was quick and the restaurant smelled delicious from the moment we walked in.    I'm a huge Pho lover and was excited to try this places recipie.  I was pleasantly surprised that there was a Leon grass flavor which worked well wht the broth ad that the spice level was chose your own with the spices they brought out with our meals.   I ordered the chicken and it was pulled, moist and flavorful.  The others in our group got the cabbage salad and the rice dishes.  They said it was good but their chicken was dry.  I tried to finish my entire meal but it was so much that I got to take some leftovers home as well (which is fantastic because I got to eat it later too!!).  I'm new to the downtown places to eat in Cleveland when I come visit my parents but would be happy to come back to eat sometime soon.",1
#NAME?,I personally think it has the best pho in Cleveland although a lot of people would disagree with me. It is authentic Vietnamese with great pho and spring rolls. The big knock on the place would be that it is too expensive for what you are getting but I realize they are compensating for their prime location. It is a great spot for lunch and I recommend it for anyone who likes this type of food.,1
#NAME?,"While this place does have ok food, I would definitely rate it in the ""Meh. I've had better"" category.  I do like the fact that there is an Asian-ish place on E. 4th, and I appreciate the fairly quick service and the large menu.  The decor is trendy asian-inspired, and its a super popular place for lunch - Saigon is always packed around noon, and its a good idea to make reservations if youre going at peak lunching hours. 

I've heard many people refer to this as a pho place, but if I go there, it would definitely not be specifically for the pho.  The pho is only ok, and none of Saigon's phos come with any of the meats and ingredients that are supposed to come with pho.  Where is the tripe? Where is (my favorite) the tendon?? Why does it not come with enough hoisin or siracha?

Aside from these issues, the rest of the food is meh.  Don't get me wrong, the food is ok for what it is - Americanized generally Asian-ish food.  You can get your spring rolls, your noodle dishes, your fried rice . .  . But you can probably find decent Panda Express-like Asian food for cheaper elsewhere (but I will say that Saigon probably has a nicer ambiance).  Basically you will be fine if you don't go in with the expectation that you will be getting authentic or inspired Vietnamese cuisine. 

Bottom line: good lunch place because of the location and quick service, but it makes me sad to hear people say that Saigon serves great Vietnamese food",0

#NAME?,"I had heard ""Mallorca"" mentioned a few times when I ask people about their favorite restaurant in the city. It had been on my list awhile and I was really looking  forward to the the evening that I ventured over. Unfortunately, I didn't find that it lived up to my expectations. 

The waiter was great! He was a fun Spanish character and even though I didn't really understand him, he really had me looking forward to the rest of my experience. We started with an appetizer of crab stuffed mushrooms.  The crab was a little too fishy.  Dinner was ok- I had a chicken breast with a lemon sauce- which tasted more like a chicken and dumplings sauce.  Not a hint of lemon. The Sangria, on the other hand, was wonderful! 

Now, I am not a conissour of authentic Spanish or Portugese food, so to be fair I should say that it might have been the most authentic dishes in the United States. However, I just didn't find that the dinner lived up to the expectations that I had for this place. I don't think that I would go back. For the price, I can get the chicken and dumplings at Cracker Barrel.  But then, there was the Sangria................",0
#NAME?,"is this place a joke.

terrible pho. Tasted no authenticity whatsoever. ID'ed every single one of us, including my bosses who look at least 35. Stirfries were unedible - worse than chinese take out honestly. Bunch of flies flying around, slow service, terrible food.

#NAME?,"We went here the Friday before Christmas this year as a Christmas present to ourselves. First time ever being here but have heard many good things. We had the reservation set for 7 pm, I thought it would've been busier but it was not at all. I enjoyed the close parking next to the restaurant for $6, well worth it. The atmosphere and appeal this place has is awesome. Very authentic in the art work show casing Salvador Dali and Diego Rivera I thought was a nice touch. Our service was excellent and the food was great. The salad before the meal has a different dressing I've never tried but liked very much. For our meals, I had the stuffed Tilapa and he had the filet. Both were perfectly cooked and he said it was the best steak he's ever had. Good news to me! Every thing was served with ""potatoes"" that were really just chips as well as veggies. We must go back, what a great experience. The homemade Sangria looks appealing and will be worth a try for our next trip. All and all we spend about $70! Not Bad!",1
#NAME?,"Let me first preface this review by saying that I have grown up with a best friend whose family moved from Vietnam only a few years before she was born, and I have spent countless meals at their home through the years. Also, I used to live in Sandusky and frequented an authentic Vietnamese restaurant called MeKong (go there!). 

So, this place. Unimpressive. The menu is small, the portions are small for what the price point is, and the flavor is small. Paying $17 for 6 boiled shrimp in broth with uncooked onions and a scoop of white rice is laughable. The service was fine, but I won't be running back.",0
#NAME?,"This place is very good. You have to know what to order. If you have had some authentic paella you may want to skip it. The seafood shines here. The portions will get you at least a lunch the next day. The service is great. They will prepare just about anything how you want it. The veal is very good. Must try the steamed octopus. Parking is a pain in the ass, but that is the w6th-w9th street thang if you know what I'm saying. (I hate paying for parking and water.) Last word of advise is not to drink that shot at the end of the meal unless you like cough syrup.",1
#NAME?,"Not a fan. I've been here twice and found the food to be mediocre at best. The restaurant is nice, an eclectic ambiance and the service is good (not great).  But you feel like you're going to get This delicious authentic meal and I was just not impressed. I know a number of people who really like it but maybe they just have not had good Spanish food.",0
#NAME?,"I'm a business traveler that has been in Cleveland for the last six months. I've eaten out a lot here. A lot. I've eaten at Saigon dozens of times, for lunches and dinners. There are many great food options in Cleveland but Saigon beat them all to become my default restaurant in the area.

Here's what else kept me coming back, over and over again.

1.   The food, duh. It has never failed me. Ever. I've eaten at more at Saigon than at Chipotle in the past year... that says a lot. The charbroiled pork rolls have become a staple of my diet. The pho is awesome for cold days or for getting over a cold (or hangover). The chicken cabbage salad is amazing and I hate salad! I have no idea if any of this is authentic, but it's damn tasty.

2.   The food is healthy! I'm no nutritionist, but my waistline and general well-being says that Saigon (for restaurant food) is actually decent for you. If you are especially ambitious, replace the vermicelli or rice with any combination of mixed veggies, lettuce, or sprouts.

3.   Service is incredibly efficient. Food comes out quickly. Waitstaff don't take notes but never forget orders, even in large parties with a ton of substitutions and special requests. Sometimes I even try to confuse them with orders like ""Saigon vermicelli, no vermicelli"" but they never mess up!

Bottom line: Maybe not the choice for a special once-a-year fine dining night, but for every other occasion -- especially when there is no occasion -- Saigon is the place to go in downtown Cleveland.",1
#NAME?,"I wasn't sure that I liked Vietnamese food.  Ages and ages ago, I went to  wonderful Vietnamese restaruant in Rochester, NY called Mamasan's and fell in love.  When I left Rochester, I went to a few takeout places trying to find the same thing and was horribily dissapointed.  The food was't subtle, but covered in excessive amounts of fish sauce.  Will the real Vietnamese food please stand up?

And then came Saigon.  Here were the light, fresh flavors I remembered.  Delightful rice paper wrapped shrimp rolls were stuffed with rice vermicelli, veggies and spiced pork and accompanied by hoisin sauce and peanuts.  My pho was subltey spicy.  Mon cher chou's melange of noodles, chicken and raw veggies with a vinegary dipping sauce was light and refreshing.

The atmosphere is elegant and beautiful, bamboo and deep red, without being even slightly kitschy.  The service is polite and friendly, although we did have trouble getting refills, possibly because it was so busy.

So, I am not sure if this is the real authentic deal, but it is really, really tasty.  It has completely reignited my interest in the cuisine.",1
#NAME?,"Great, authentic food and a fantastic wine list!",1
#NAME?,"A buddy and I dined here on a Saturday night while in town for a meeting.  It was easy to get a table though all of the booths were taken.  We both had a ""33"" to drink, which was my first Vietnamese beer since visiting Hanoi in '99.  We had a couple of great apps, mine was bo nuong la, and I had bun saigon for my entree.  Everything was tasty and seemed very authentic.  The sevice was great too.  Next time I'm in Cleveland I'll try to pay another visit.",1
#NAME?,"Saigon is the upscale Vietnamese restaurant in the East 4th district in downtown Cleveland. Their food is good but I've had more authentic tasting food at other Asian and Vietnamese restaurants in Cleveland. I ordered pho soup and the soup was a bit one note and there was not much variety to the cuts of beef in the ""special.""  Their drinks and cocktails were very good and rival those found in any of the restaurants in Cleveland for fine dining. I think that at this restaurant you really are paying for ambiance at this location more than taste. Though I enjoyed the food here, I don't think Saigon is my favorite in Cleveland.",0
#NAME?,"I don't know what got into me. My craving for some paella led me to Mallorca despite all the not-so-great reviews about this place. The result = disappointment, to say the least (and deserved)
When we arrived at this place, our host sat us down at a table and began explaining the menu + specials to us. Problem 1. I can't understand what he is saying. I understand they are trying to make things more ""authentic"" by using servers with a Spanish accent but people have to understand what you are saying.

Problem 2. Appetizers (Shrimp + garlic sauce; some soup) were too salty.

Problem 3. The paella didn't tasted ... meh. And it comes with ""Spanish potatoes."" Basically over-baked Lays Chips. Not even kidding.

Problem 4. Price. Super expensive for what you get. 25+ bucks for most of the entrees.

If you want authentic Spanish food, don't even bother coming here. It's not worth it.

If you want a casual dinner, don't even bother coming here. It's too expensive for it to be casual.

If you want to take some one out for a meal, don't even bother coming here. You could probably use that money to go somewhere much nicer.

Honestly, I can't say anything good about this restaurant. I won't be going back. I hope you don't make the same mistake I made.",0
#NAME?,"Coming from a Spanish family, I had a lot of expectations when dining at Mallorca.  The menu was ok but not as authentic as I was expecting--no fabada which is one of my favorite dishes.  We started with the mussels in spicy sauce--it was ok--sauce was not spicy but had that spanish white wine red sauce taste which seemed promising.  For our entrees, we ordered a pork in Osso bucco style and stuffed trout.  The pork was cooked well, but the sauce was tasteless--a very bland tomato sauce which did not marry with the pork at all.  The trout was even worst--stuffed with a mayonaisse crab that tasted a few days old!  The trout was then drenched in a butter sauce that when combined with the mayo seemed just too much.  I had a lot of expectations and they weren't met even half way.  I would recommend against going to this restaurant there are a lot of other really great restaurants in Cleveland..",0
#NAME?,Went here for NYE Dinner. Service was slow and rather unfriendly. The server was more concerned with his bigger tables and basically ignored our table of 2. Booked a early reservation to beat the crowd so we could get our drink on for NYE. I ordered the Paella which was probably one of the worst I have ever had. All the seafood was overcooked and rubbery and dry. The sausage they have is awesome. I had better expectations for this place. But it is cleveland and I guess the spanish/south american delicacy I was looking for was not very authentic. I probably would not return here.,0
#NAME?,"Visiting Cleveland and stopped by here. Firstly, waited forever for my order to be taken on a slow day. They seem to have regulars that they take care of which is surprising that people would come back here. The food is cheap but neither authentic nor good. Not to mention , there was a bug in my salad. But that's ok because I didn't plan on eating the thousand island dressing.",0
#NAME?,"Saigon is the absolute best! Mr Bon is so friendly, the service is fast and great and the food is amazing. I've worked nearby for 6 years and still eat it several times a week. Prices and portions are great! The food is so flavorful and authentic, after a week out of the office, i look forward to coming back and getting Saigon. I can't say enough good things- a gem in the east 4th street area.",1
#NAME?,"Mallorca is my favorite restaurant experience in Cleveland--from the quality, variety, and portions of food, to the kindness, humor, and passion of the staff, they truly make their guests feel like kings and queens. The family-style manner in which food is served allows guests to experience authentic Spanish & Portuguese food that is elite, with larger portions than you may ever find in a fine-dining environment.

Highly recommend Caldo Gallego (soup) and Garlic Shrimp and Calamari appetizers. For main course, decisions are so tough...Paella, Garlic chicken and the Stuffed Tilapia are all decadent. When they have the Beef short ribs on special, that is a ""Top 5"" bite of food in Cleveland.  Tremendous wine list and very fairly priced in comparison to other fine dinning establishments.

Dinner is a gem for a special occasion, big group or romantic occasion. But the Lunch is probably the best deal I've seen in all of Ohio. I love this restaurant.",1
#NAME?,I think this is one the best bun bo hue in Cleveland area. Their service was super fast. The bun bo hue was full of aroma and spicy. Their spring roll was good but I didn't like their sauce that much. I would probably come back for other dishes but their bun bo hue is very authentic.,1
#NAME?,"We are travelers from CA, where every other door of Asian restaurants is guaranteed. So I usually get disappointed at the taste of Asian food when I travel other states except NY. Again disappointed at another Asian restaurant in downtown Cleveland despite they have 4.5 Yelp rating, we came to this restaurant hopelessly since we were craving for soup noodles. Folks.. this restaurant is truly amazing. Food is delicious and authentic. We actually came here twice during our five days of stay.  

We had pho chicken, chicken broth soup noodle, vermicelli noodle with chicken, vermicelli noodle with pork+shrimp+egg roll, lettuce wrap with chicken, and shrimp roll. EVERY food deserves five star (maybe 3-4 start for shrimp roll..haha) 

Not sure if I would ever visit Cleveland again, but if it happens I would definitely come back!",1
#NAME?,"Excellent and authentic food. Having been in Spain and Portugal a few weeks back, I was craving their food and Mallorca delivered! I had the stuffed salmon (stuffed with crab) and it came with rice and veggies. I enjoyed every bite of this delicious meal! The service was also fantastic!!",1
#NAME?,"This is the first tapas meal I've eaten in ages in which every dish was superb. We tried the filet mignon and shrimp dish(flavorful/perfectly cooked to med. rare), chorizo-stuffed clams(a must try) and calamari(wow). The sangria was deliciously authentic(seemed to include a $$ bordeaux, unlike most). 

Portions were good and the food and service were phenomenal. Additionally, the ambiance here is very tasteful sans pretentiousness.",1
#NAME?,"I'd say authentic working class bar, but I am not sure these guys have jobs.  This is a real place to go drinking.  Love the old stools, old bar, Browns and steel mill memorabilia.",1
#NAME?,"I like cocktail bars, and I like visiting Cleveland. This bar, however, feels like it's trying a bit too hard with the theme.  The music was kind of too much, and it was pretty bright in there. After my cocktail, I ordered a glass of Cab. Don't do that!  The only Cab available is $20. I didn't look at the menu before ordering, but I'd also expect a warning if the only Cab is $20/glass. Overall, I think there are better, more authentic cocktail bars in Cleveland. Find those!",0
